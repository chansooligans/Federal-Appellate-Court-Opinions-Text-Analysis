This appeal presents intriguing\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nquestions anent  the rights  of a  corporate officer  who, having\n\nsigned  an  agreement containing  an  arbitration  clause in  his\n\nofficial capacity,  seeks to compel arbitration  of claims lodged\n\nagainst  him as  an individual.   The  district court  refused to\n\norder arbitration under these circumstances.  We affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          For purposes  of this  appeal, the facts  can be  taken\n\nessentially  as alleged.  In 1987,  plaintiff-appellee Walton  W.\n\nMcCarthy, a renowned inventor of  underground shelter technology,\n\nincorporated  T.H.E.T.A.  Technologies,  Inc.  (Theta  I), a  New\n\nHampshire   corporation,  for   the   purpose  of   manufacturing\n\nunderground storage tanks and  personal shelters.  McCarthy owned\n\nfifty  percent  of  the  corporation's stock  and  served  as its\n\nprincipal operating  officer.   Three passive investors  held the\n\nremaining shares.\n\n          In the fall  of 1989, McCarthy met  defendant-appellant\n\nLeo  L.  Azure,  Jr.,  a  member  of  a  Montana-based  religious\n\norganization, Church Universal &amp; Triumphant (C.U.T.).  Azure soon\n\nentered into negotiations for  the acquisition of both McCarthy's\n\ncompany  and  patented technology.    Azure  formed a  Washington\n\ncorporation, Theta Corporation  (Theta II), to serve as a vehicle\n\nfor the planned purchase.\n\n          On December  29, 1989,  McCarthy, Theta II,  and others\n\n                                2\n\nentered into a contract (the Purchase Agreement).1  Azure  signed\n\nthe Purchase Agreement on behalf of Theta II, but he did not sign\n\nit  in  his  personal capacity.    Leaving  to  one side  special\n\narrangements  with  various creditors,  see  supra  note 1,  this\n                                                  \n\ncontract  delineated a  two-phase transaction:   McCarthy  was to\n\nsell his equity interest,  including the patents, to the  passive\n\ninvestors,  and transfer  certain  residual rights  to Theta  II;\n\nthen, Theta  II was to buy  all the outstanding stock  of Theta I\n\nfor cash, payable over a period of no more than three years.  The\n\nPurchase  Agreement expressly  provided that  \"[d]isputes arising\n\nunder this Agreement  shall be  resolved by arbitration.  . .  .\"\n\nThough  not  mentioned in  the  Purchase  Agreement, the  parties\n\napparently  understood  that  Theta  II, in  addition  to  paying\n\nMcCarthy  a prescribed sum  of money for  the transferred rights,\n\nwould offer him employment under a separate long-term contract.\n\n          On January 11, 1990,  McCarthy and Theta II  executed a\n\nsecond agreement (the  Confidentiality Agreement).  Azure  signed\n\nthe  Confidentiality Agreement,  as  he had  signed the  Purchase\n\nAgreement, on  behalf of  Theta  II, but  not otherwise;  indeed,\n\nneither document contained a line for Azure's personal signature.\n\nPursuant to the Confidentiality  Agreement, McCarthy promised  to\n\nkeep all past and future information pertaining to the patents in\n\nthe bosom of the  lodge, and to  take certain related actions  on\n\n                    \n\n     1Apart  from  McCarthy and  Theta II,  other parties  to the\nPurchase Agreement included the passive investors and three major\ncreditors of Theta I.  For present purposes, nothing turns on the\ninvolvement of the other parties.\n\n                                3\n\nbehalf  of Theta  II.   This agreement  included a  somewhat more\n\nexpansive   arbitration   clause,   which   stated   that  \"[a]ny\n\ncontroversy  or  claim  arising  out  of  or  relating   to  this\n\nAgreement, or breach hereof, shall be settled by arbitration. . .\n\n.\"   At a closing held the next  day, Theta II delivered a letter\n\n(the Employment Letter) engaging McCarthy as its president, chief\n\nengineer,  and chief  executive  officer at  a stipulated  annual\n\nsalary.  The  Employment Letter also provided for  stock options.\n\nIt did not include an arbitration clause.\n\n          A little over two weeks after the closing, matters took\n\na turn  for the bizarre  (or, at  least, for the  mystical).   On\n\nJanuary  28, 1990,  Elizabeth  Clare Prophet,  Azure's  spiritual\n\nleader, informed him, on  the advice of a \"dead  ascended master\"\n\nof C.U.T., that his newly acquired business was incompatible with\n\nhis \"divine plan\" and that he should not devote further energy to\n\nthe enterprise.  Azure dutifully directed McCarthy to cashier all\n\nthe  employees  of Theta  II,  and  then  proceeded to  terminate\n\nMcCarthy's employment.    McCarthy never  obtained any  ownership\n\ninterest in  Theta II, notwithstanding the  promises contained in\n\nthe Employment Letter.\n\n          Apparently, Azure's  religious convictions took  him so\n\nfar, and no further.   He not only continued operating  the Theta\n\ncorporations, but also formed a third company, Omega Corporation.\n\nIn October of  1990, after  Azure merged Theta  I into Theta  II,\n\nOmega  acquired  the surviving  entity.   The following  July, it\n\nbegan  selling shares  to  the  public.    For  all  intents  and\n\n                                4\n\npurposes, Omega's business seemed  indistinguishable from that of\n\nTheta I  and  Theta  II;  Omega  styled itself  as  a  leader  in\n\nunderground storage and  marketed tanks manufactured pursuant  to\n\nMcCarthy's patented technology.\n\n          Unwilling to turn the other cheek, McCarthy sued Azure,\n\nTheta  II, Omega,  C.U.T.,  and  Prophet  in  the  United  States\n\nDistrict  Court for the District of New Hampshire.2  Azure, Theta\n\nII,  and  Omega  filed  a  motion  to  stay  proceedings  pending\n\narbitration,  contending  that  the serial  agreements  obligated\n\nplaintiff to arbitrate  all claims.   The district court  granted\n\nthe motion  with respect to  Theta II,  but denied it  as to  the\n\nremaining  movants.   Azure  appeals the  district court's  order\n\nrefusing to stay the action against him.  We have jurisdiction by\n\nvirtue of 9 U.S.C.   16(a)(1) (Supp. 1992).\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          The court below reasoned that the source of appellant's\n\npurported right to compel  arbitration must be found, if  at all,\n\nin the  Purchase Agreement.3   It then denied  appellant's motion\n\n                    \n\n     2The complaint asserted claims  against Azure, Theta II, and\nOmega for,  inter alia,  breach of contract,  wrongful discharge,\n                      \nfraud,  negligent  misrepresentation,  intentional infliction  of\nemotional  distress, unfair  trade practices,  federal  and state\nsecurities violations, and racketeering.  It also asserted claims\nagainst Azure, C.U.T., and Prophet for tortious interference with\ncontractual  relationships.   Jurisdiction  was premised  on  the\nexistence of both federal questions, 28 U.S.C.   1331 (1988), and\ndiversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.   1332(a)(1) (1988).\n\n     3Because the Confidentiality Agreement granted  legal rights\nonly to Theta II and not to McCarthy, we agree  with the district\ncourt's  conclusion  that  it  could  not  furnish  a  basis  for\nprecluding  access  to a  judicial  forum  in  respect to  claims\nasserted by McCarthy against Azure.  For that reason, and for the\n\n                                5\n\nto stay  on the ground that  he was not  a party to  the Purchase\n\nAgreement and, therefore, could  not compel arbitration of claims\n\nlodged  against  him  personally,  whether or  not  those  claims\n\nrelated to  that agreement.   Azure's  appeal tests this  thesis.\n\nBecause the appeal presents a  question of law, appellate  review\n\nis plenary.  See United States v. Gifford,     F.3d    ,     (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1994) [No. 93-1645, slip  op. at 20]; Liberty Mut.  Ins. Co.\n                                                                 \n\nv. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                            \n\n                     A.  General Principles.\n                                           \n\n          We  start with  bedrock:  \"arbitration  is a  matter of\n\ncontract  and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration\n\nany  dispute  which he  has  not  agreed  so to  submit.\"    AT&amp;T\n                                                                 \n\nTechnologies, Inc.  v. Communications Workers, 475  U.S. 643, 648\n                                             \n\n(1986), quoting United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navig. Co.,\n                                                                \n\n363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960).  Thus, a party seeking to substitute an\n\narbitral forum for a judicial forum must show, at a bare minimum,\n\nthat the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.\n                                                   \n\n          This  imperative is  in  no way  inconsistent with  the\n\nacknowledged  \"federal policy  favoring  arbitration.\"   Moses H.\n                                                                 \n\nCone  Memorial Hosp.  v. Mercury  Constr. Corp.,  460 U.S.  1, 24\n                                               \n\n(1983); see also Shearson/American  Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 220, 226  (1987).  The  federal policy  presumes proof of  a\n\npreexisting agreement  to arbitrate disputes arising  between the\n\nprotagonists.    Once  that agreement  has  been  proven  and the\n\n                    \n\nadded reason that appellant, individually, was not a signatory to\nthe Confidentiality  Agreement, our analysis  revolves around the\nPurchase Agreement.\n\n                                6\n\nprotagonists identified, cases such  as Cone and McMahon instruct\n                                                        \n\ncourts   to  use   a  particular   hermeneutical  principle   for\n\ninterpreting the  breadth  of  the  agreement; that  is,  if  the\n\ncontract  language chosen  by the  parties is  unclear as  to the\n\nnature  of the claims to which an agreement to arbitrate extends,\n\na \"healthy  regard\" for  the federal policy  favoring arbitration\n\nrequires that \"any doubts  concerning the scope of  an arbitrable\n\nissue be resolved  in favor of arbitration.\"  Moses  H. Cone, 460\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  24-25.  The federal policy,  however, does not extend to\n\nsituations in which the  identity of the parties who  have agreed\n\nto  arbitrate is unclear.  See Painewebber, Inc. v. Hartmann, 921\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 507,  511 (3d  Cir. 1990) (holding  that \"[a]s  a matter  of\n\ncontract, no party can  be forced to arbitrate unless  that party\n\nhas entered into an agreement  to do so\").  Thus, requiring  that\n\narbitration rest on a  consensual foundation is wholly consistent\n\nwith federal policy.\n\n          The  requirement  also makes  perfect  sense.   Subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over  an action  or series of  claims can  be\n\nconceptualized as  conferring a personal right on  the parties to\n\nhave  that action,  or those  claims, adjudicated  in a  judicial\n\nforum.  See,  e.g., Pacemaker  Diag. Clinic of  America, Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\nInstromedix,  Inc., 725 F.2d 537,  541 (9th Cir.  1984) (en banc)\n                  \n\n(recognizing  that the  \"federal litigant  has a  personal right,\n\nsubject to  exceptions in  certain classes  of  cases, to  demand\n\nArticle III adjudication of a civil suit\"); accord Glidden Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nZdanok,  370 U.S.  530,  536 (1962).

Framing the Issue.\n                                           \n\n          Viewed against  this backdrop, the  question before  us\n\nreduces to a matter  of contract interpretation:  Did  plaintiff,\n\nin executing the Purchase  Agreement, agree to arbitrate disputes\n\nhe  might have  with  Azure  personally concerning  Theta-related\n                                       \n\ntransactions?4  This question,  which involves the interpretation\n\nof an  arbitration provision touching upon  matters of interstate\n\ncommerce,  must  be  resolved  according to  federal  law.    See\n                                                                 \n\nMcGregor v.

See NRM\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.  v.  Hercules, Inc.,  758 F.2d  676,  681 (D.C.

Given this agreement,  plaintiff henceforth will\nbe disabled from pursuing  any such claims.

After all,  appellant signed\n          \n\nthe Purchase Agreement solely  in his capacity as an  agent for a\n\ndisclosed principal    that is, as  \"Chairman\" of Theta II    and\n\nnot  in  his  personal   capacity;  and  it  is  settled   beyond\n\nperadventure that a person signing a contract only in a corporate\n\ncapacity, and unambiguously  indicating that fact on the  face of\n\nthe  contract documents, does not  thereby become a  party to the\n\nagreement.  See, e.g., New York Ass'n for Retarded Children, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nIn re  Oil Spill by Amoco  Cadiz, 659 F.2d 789,  795-96 (7th Cir.\n                                \n\n1981); Fisser  v.

Thus, appellant's failure to sign\n\nthe  Purchase Agreement  individually does  not in and  of itself\n\nsettle the somewhat different  question of whether he  can invoke\n\nthe  arbitration  clause  contained  therein.   Seizing  on  this\n\npossibility,  appellant charts  three routes  by which  he, as  a\n\nnonsignatory,  might achieve  the sanctuary he  desires.   In the\n\nsucceeding sections,  we trace  these routes  and explain  why we\n\nfind them to be blind alleys.\n\n                  C.

He buttresses  this claim by  citation to  authority\n\nfrom  several other courts of  appeals.  See  Pritzker v.

We\n                                         \n\nthink appellant's reading of these  cases is overly sanguine  and\n\nthat his claim is insupportable for several reasons.\n\n          1.  Comparing   Apples to Oranges.  To  put appellant's\n          1.  Comparing   Apples to Oranges.\n                                           \n\ntheorem  into   focus,  we  first  must   clarify  the  animating\n\n                                11\n\nprinciples  that  drive the  cases  on which  the  theorem rests.\n\nDoing  so persuades  us  that appellant  is  comparing apples  to\n\noranges.\n\n          To be  sure, there is a  superficial similarity between\n\nthe  precedents on which  appellant relies  and the  situation at\n\nhand.    In each  of  the  four cited  cases,  the  court gave  a\n\nnonsignatory the benefit of  an arbitration clause signed  by the\n\ncorporate entity for which he  or she worked.  In three  of these\n\ncases, however, the defendant was sued qua employee and the court\n                                          \n\nspecifically found that, as  a matter of contract interpretation,\n\nthe   parties  intended  the   arbitration  provision   to  cover\n\nemployees.    See Roby,  996 F.2d  at  1360 (observing  that \"the\n                      \n\nparties fully intended  to protect the  individual Chairs to  the\n\nextent they are charged  with misconduct within the scope  of the\n\nagreements\");  Arnold, 920  F.2d  at 1282  (explaining that  \"the\n                     \n\nlanguage of the arbitration agreement indicates that the parties'\n\nbasic  intent was  to  provide a  single  arbitral forum  to  all\n\ndisputes  arising under the  stock purchase agreement\"); Letizia,\n                                                                \n\n802 F.2d at 1188 (determining that the company \"clearly indicated\n\nits  intention  to  protect  its   employees\"  by  means  of  the\n\narbitration  provision).  The fourth case  also rested largely on\n\ncontract  language.   See Pritzker,  7 F.3d  at 1114  (noting the\n                                  \n\nbreadth of language used in formulating the arbitration clause).\n\n          Here, however,  as opposed  to the cases  marshalled by\n\nappellant, the arbitration clause fails to indicate the corporate\n\nsignatory's  intention to protect  employees through arbitration,\n\n                                12\n\nsee  Letizia,  802  F.2d at  1188,  and the  very  nature  of the\n            \n\nPurchase Agreement,  as contrasted  to the  agreements underlying\n\nthe  other cases,  explains  why, in  this  situation, one  would\n\nnaturally expect such protection to be absent.\n\n          For  the  most  part,  the cases  hawked  by  appellant\n\ninvolve   disputes  growing  out  of  service  contracts  between\n\nindividuals and  financial institutions.6   See Pritzker,  7 F.3d\n                                                        \n\nat 1114  (involving handling  of cash management  account); Roby,\n                                                                \n\n996 F.2d at 1357 (involving insurance underwriting); Letizia, 802\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 1186  (involving handling of  securities account).   The\n\nclaims  diverted to  arbitration in  those cases    and  in other\n\ncases that appellant  could have,  but did not,  rely upon,  see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Lee v. Chica, 983 F.2d 883,  887 (8th Cir. 1993); Scher v.\n                                                              \n\nBear Stearns &amp; Co., 723 F. Supp. 211, 216 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)   were,\n                  \n\nwithout  exception, in  the nature  of professional  malpractice.\n\nThus,  each  related  directly  to  the essence  of  the  service\n\ncontract that  the consumer-plaintiff had signed.7   The Purchase\n\nAgreement is at a considerable  remove; it is primarily concerned\n\n                    \n\n     6The solitary exception  is Arnold.   Yet, as  we point  out\n                                       \nsubsequently,  see infra note 10, that case is distinguishable on\n                        \nother  grounds  and,  in  all  events,  does  not  possess  great\npersuasive force.\n\n     7This is  not to  suggest  that similarity  of claims  alone\nsuffices to clear  the decks  for arbitration.   As we have  made\npellucid,  see supra p. 7, the basic prerequisite is the parties'\n                    \nagreement  to arbitrate, or, put another way, the existence of an\nactual waiver of the right to litigate.  But similarity of claims\nsometimes may help to clarify what the parties intended when they\nincluded an arbitration provision in an instrument.\n\n                                13\n\nwith  a transfer  of assets.8   The  distinction is  an important\n\none.   A person  who enters into  a service contract  with a firm\n\ncontemplates an ongoing relationship in which the firm's promises\n\nonly  can  be fulfilled  by  future  (unspecified)  acts  of  its\n\nemployees  or agents stretching well into an uncertain future.  A\n\nperson who contracts to transfer assets to a company faces a much\n\ndifferent  prospect:    a   one-shot  transaction  in  which  the\n\npurchaser's  obligations  are  specified  and  are,  essentially,\n\nperformed in full  at the closing, or soon thereafter.   So it is\n\nhere.   And  because  the  Purchase  Agreement cannot  easily  be\n\nconstrued to refer to the operations of, or services rendered by,\n\nTheta II,  that company's employees cannot  plausibly be included\n\nby  implication within the ambit  of either the  agreement or its\n\narbitration clause.9\n\n          2.  The Scope of the Arbitration Clause.  Close textual\n          2.  The Scope of the Arbitration Clause.\n                                                 \n\nanalysis supports  the conclusion  that the  Purchase Agreement's\n\narbitration  clause should be read more narrowly than the clauses\n\nin the cases upon which appellant relies.  The Purchase Agreement\n\nprovides  that disputes  \"arising  under\" the  agreement will  be\n\nsubject  to  arbitration.   This  language  is considerably  more\n\n                    \n\n     8While one  section of the Purchase  Agreement describes the\nsellers'  retention of a right to purchase products from Theta II\nat preferential  prices and to  distribute those products  in New\nEngland, appellant has not argued  that any of McCarthy's  claims\nimplicate this distribution provision.\n\n     9Although we do  not decide the point, we note  that even an\nimplied reference likely  would not  suffice as  a predicate  for\nenforced  arbitration.    See  Salzman  Sign,  176  N.E.2d at  76\n                                            \n(requiring \"direct and  explicit evidence of actual intent\"  as a\nprerequisite to finding an obligation to arbitrate).\n\n                                14\n\nconfining  than  that  employed   in  other  contracts  to  which\n\nappellant alludes.10  See  Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114  (agreeing to\n                                   \n\narbitrate  \"all  controversies   which  may  arise  between   us,\n\nincluding but  not limited to .  . . this or  any other agreement\n\nbetween us, whether entered into prior, or subsequent to the date\n\nhereof\");  Roby, 996  F.2d  at 1361  (agreeing  to arbitrate  any\n               \n\n\"dispute,  difference,  question  or   claim  relating  to\"   the\n                                                          \n\nagreements for  \"all purposes  of and in  connection with\"  them)\n                                                         \n\n(emphasis in  original); Letizia, 802  F.2d at 1186  (agreeing to\n                                \n\narbitrate disputes  \"arising out  of or relating  to\" plaintiff's\n\nsecurities account).  \n\n          The  circumscribed nature  of the  Purchase Agreement's\n\narbitration provision stands out in bold relief when one compares\n\nit  with  the  arbitration   provision  in  the   Confidentiality\n\nAgreement.    Whereas  the  former directs  arbitration  only  of\n\n\"[d]isputes arising under  [the agreement]\" (emphasis  supplied),\n                         \n\nthe  latter directs  arbitration of  \"[a]ny controversy  or claim\n                                           \n\narising  out  of  or   relating  to  [the  agreement]\"  (emphasis\n                                   \n\nsupplied).

See Arnold,  920 F.2d  at\n                                                  \n1271.   But in  Arnold, unlike  in this case,  the stated  clause\n                      \ncomprised the only arbitration provision at issue, thus making it\nmuch easier  to read the language  broadly.

The  integration clause states that  the\n\nwritten  agreement  \"represents the  entire understanding  of the\n\nparties\" and \"supersedes  all other understandings,  arrangements\n\nand negotiations.\"  We, and other courts, routinely have declined\n\n                                16\n\nto  read  unwritten  terms  into  agreements  containing  similar\n\ndeclarations.

Operating in  this\n\nmode, it is difficult to see how a lawsuit between the seller and\n\na nonsignatory who is not a successor in interest  to the buyer's\n\nrights can be  said to \"aris[e] under\"  the Purchase Agreement.11\n\nThus, appellant's effort to  compel plaintiff to arbitrate cannot\n\nsucceed, for, \"as a matter of contract, no party can be forced to\n\narbitrate unless that party  has entered an agreement to  do so.\"\n\nPainewebber, 921 F.2d at 511.\n           \n\n          3.

The  ubiquity\n\nof  the  distinction   is  a  reflection  of   the  reality  that\n\nindividuals in  our complex society  frequently act on  behalf of\n\nother parties   a reality that often makes it unfair to credit or\n\nblame the actor, individually, for such acts.  At the same  time,\n\nthe  law strikes  a  wise balance  by  refusing automatically  to\n\nsaddle   a   principal   with   total   responsibility    for   a\n\nrepresentative's  conduct,  come  what  may,  and  by   declining\n\n                                20\n\nmechanically  to  limit  an   injured  party's  recourse  to  the\n\nprincipal alone, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n          Appellant suggests that  policy considerations  counsel\n\nagainst giving  credence to  the distinction between  a corporate\n\nofficer's  personal and  representative  capacities.   He asserts\n\nthat, by honoring the distinction, we will enable wily plaintiffs\n\nto circumvent arbitration provisions to which they previously had\n\nagreed.  To  prevent such  end runs, appellant  says, agents  and\n\nemployees must be allowed  to stand in the principal's  stead for\n\nthe  purpose of  invoking arbitration clauses.   See  Arnold, 920\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1281.   We believe that policy considerations,  placed in\n\nproper perspective, tilt in the opposite direction.\n\n          For one thing, to the extent that appellant's professed\n\nfear of artful pleading  is genuine, the best preventative  is to\n\nact  before, rather than after,  the fact; to  be blunt, judicial\n                              \n\njuggling is a far  less effective anodyne than  skillful drafting\n\nof  contract documents in the first instance.  A corporation that\n\nwishes to bring its  agents and employees into the  arbitral tent\n\ncan  do so  by  writing  contracts  in general,  and  arbitration\n\nclauses  in particular,  in ways  that will  specify the  desired\n\nresult.  See, e.g., Roby, 996 F.2d at 1361.\n                        \n\n          For  another  thing,  whether  a  claim  properly  lies\n\nagainst  a  party in  his personal  capacity  or in  his official\n\ncapacity is ultimately a  function of the facts, not  of pleading\n\ntechniques alone.  Mechanisms  exist for dealing with groundless,\n\noverstated, or elliptical claims.  See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ.

Arbitration is almost  invariably a\n\ncreature of contract, and  an agent is not ordinarily  liable for\n\nhis principal's breach  of contract.   See, e.g., Mastropieri  v.\n                                                             \n\nSolmar Constr.

Thus, manipulating the reality  of events in\n\norder to bring suit against the agent holds only marginal promise\n\nof financial reward.\n\n          Perhaps   most  important  from  a  policy  standpoint,\n\nadopting   appellant's  proposal  would   introduce  a  troubling\n\n                                22\n\nasymmetry into the  law.

In\n                     \n\nappellant's scenario,  then, the  agent, though he  could not  be\n\ncompelled to arbitrate, nonetheless  could compel the claimant to\n\nsubmit to arbitration.   In other words, an agent for a disclosed\n\nprincipal would  enjoy the  benefits of the  principal's arbitral\n\nagreement, but would shoulder  none of the corresponding burdens.\n\nHe would have found a way, contrary to folklore, to  run with the\n\nhare and  hunt with the hounds.  In our view, judges should think\n\nlong and hard before endorsing a  rule that will allow a party to\n\nuse the  courts to vindicate  his rights  while at the  same time\n\nforeclosing his adversary from comparable access.\n\n          Here, for  instance,  appellant insists  that  the  law\n\nempowers him  to shunt McCarthy's claims into  an arbitral forum,\n\ndespite  the  fact that,  if  the shoe  were  on the  other foot,\n\n                    \n\n     14We  reject  Azure's  contention  that  the Eighth  Circuit\nsignificantly narrowed Flink's rule in Lee, 983  F.2d at 887.

The Nature of the Claims.\n                                      \n\nfor the sake of completeness, that the bulk of plaintiff's claims\n\nare litigable in any  event simply because they fall  outside the\n\nambit of  the Purchase  Agreement's closely tailored  arbitration\n\nclause.    For example,  the claims  for  breach of  contract and\n\nwrongful discharge concern plaintiff's  employment rights.  Those\n\nrights are  not mentioned at  all in the Purchase  Agreement.  To\n\nthe  contrary, they  come within  the purview  of the  Employment\n\nLetter    a  document  that conspicuously  omits any  arbitration\n\nprovision.   Similarly,  many  aspects of  plaintiff's claims  of\n\nfraud,  misrepresentation,  emotional   distress,  unfair   trade\n\npractices, and racketeering relate to his employment rights, and,\n\nto  that extent, also  do not implicate  the Purchase Agreement's\n\narbitration provision.  And while the remaining claims touch upon\n\nthe Purchase Agreement, they do not uniformly \"aris[e] under\" it.\n\n          No  useful purpose would be served by reciting book and\n\n                                24\n\nverse.  It suffices  to say that, even  if Azure were a party  to\n\nthe contract  that contains the operative  arbitration provision,\n\nhe  would  not  be  entitled as  of  right  to  an  order staying\n\nlitigation of all   or  even most of   McCarthy's claims.   See 9\n                                                               \n\nU.S.C.   3.15\n\n         D.

This claim also fails.\n\n          As  is  generally  the  case  in  matters  of  contract\n\ninterpretation, \"[t]he crux in third-party beneficiary analysis .\n\n.  .  is  the  intent  of  the  parties.\"    Mowbray  v.

Because  third-party beneficiary  status  constitutes an\n\nexception  to the  general rule  that a  contract does  not grant\n\nenforceable rights to nonsignatories,  see, e.g., Arlington Trust\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v.

Neither Azure nor any other employee of Theta II\n\nis mentioned explicitly in  the Purchase Agreement; there are  no\n\nmeaningful categorical  references; the critical provision in the\n\ncontract,  see supra  note 11,  omits any  mention of  agents and\n                    \n\nemployees;  and we  can find  no principled  basis for  including\n\nAzure  by  necessary implication  (especially since  the contract\n\ncontains an  integration clause).

The last shot in appellant's sling\n\nderives from this allegation:   he asseverates that he  should be\n\naccorded  the right to  demand arbitration based  on the asserted\n\nequivalence between him  and his corporate principal.   This shot\n\nexhibits  a basic  misunderstanding of  the weapon  appellant has\n\nselected.  Not surprisingly, it misses the mark.\n\n          The alter  ego doctrine is  equitable in nature.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Harrell v. DCS Equip.

Without exception,  these cases involve instances in\n\nwhich  an allegedly aggrieved party has sought to compel a person\n\nor  entity thought  to be  a corporate  signatory's alter  ego to\n\nabide by an arbitration clause.   Typical of the genre is Fisser,\n                                                                \n\na case holding that \"if the parent is bound to the contract, then\n\nits  marionette [the  alleged alter  ego] is  bound to  submit to\n\narbitration.\"  282 F.2d at 234-35.\n\n          We are confronted with a  much different situation.  In\n\nthis case, the supposed  wrongdoer seeks to invoke the  alter ego\n\ndoctrine in order to  hide behind the corporate entity,  that is,\n\nto  avail  himself of  the corporation's  right  to repair  to an\n\narbitral  forum and thereby avoid a jury  trial.  As appellant is\n\nnot  even  arguably  an  innocent third  party  disadvantaged  by\n\nsomeone else's blurring of the line between a corporation and the\n\n                                28\n\nperson who controls it,  but, rather, is  himself the one who  is\n\nclaimed to have obscured  the line, he cannot be permitted to use\n\nthe alter ego designation to his own behoof.17\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  Although the Purchase Agreement\n\ndoes contain an  arbitration clause,  it is narrow  in scope  and\n\ndoes  not extend  the right  to compel  arbitration to  agents or\n\nemployees of  the  corporate  signatory.    By  like  token,  the\n\nPurchase Agreement does not make  manifest an intention to confer\n\nthird-party beneficiary  status on any such  agents or employees.\n\nAnd,  finally, appellant  cannot  rely on  plaintiff's alter  ego\n\nclaim to  draw an equivalence  between himself and  his corporate\n\nprincipal  for his own benefit.  In  sum, there is no contractual\n\nor  other legal lever by  which appellant can  force plaintiff to\n\narbitrate the  \"individual capacity\" claims that  are the subject\n\nof the underlying  suit.  Because this is so,  the district court\n\nappropriately  refused  to   grant  the  relief  that   appellant\n\nrequested.18\n\n                    \n\n     17We  note   that,  although  plaintiff  has   alleged  that\nappellant  is  the alter  ego of  Theta  II, appellant  has never\nadmitted the truth of the allegation.  While not necessary to our\ndecision, we  are impelled  to remark the  obvious:  it  would be\nstrange  if an equitable doctrine  could be construed  to allow a\nparty, on one hand,  to resist the characterization that he  is a\ncorporation's  alter ego, and, on  the second hand,  to allow him\nsimultaneously  to  use  that  characterization as  a  device  to\nsidetrack the characterizer's suit.\n\n     18On  remand, the  district  court,  by  appropriate  order,\nshould conform plaintiff's complaint to the  representations made\nin this court, see  supra note 4, dismissing any  claims asserted\n                         \nagainst  Azure  in a  representative  capacity  and striking  all\nrelated references from the complaint.\n\n                                29\n\n          The  order appealed  from is affirmed  and the  case is\n                                                                 \n\nremanded  to the  district court  for further  proceedings.

The district court refused to order arbitration under these circumstances.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, the facts can be taken essentially as alleged.  In 1987, plaintiff-appellee Walton W. McCarthy, a renowned inventor of underground shelter technology, incorporated T.H.E.T.A. Technologies, Inc.  (Theta I), a New Hampshire corporation, for the purpose of manufacturing underground storage tanks and personal shelters.  McCarthy owned fifty percent of the corporation's stock and served as its principal operating officer.  Three passive investors held the remaining shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1989, McCarthy met defendant-appellant Leo L. Azure, Jr., a member of a Montana-based religious organization, Church Universal &amp; Triumphant (C.U.T.).  Azure soon entered into negotiations for the acquisition of both McCarthy's company and patented technology.  Azure formed a Washington corporation, Theta Corporation (Theta II), to serve as a vehicle for the planned purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1989, McCarthy, Theta II, and others entered into a contract (the Purchase Agreement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Azure signed the Purchase Agreement on behalf of Theta II, but he did not sign it in his personal capacity.  Leaving to one side special arrangements with various creditors, see supra note 1, this contract delineated a two-phase transaction:  McCarthy was to sell his equity interest, including the patents, to the passive investors, and transfer certain residual rights to Theta II;  then, Theta II was to buy all the outstanding stock of Theta I for cash, payable over a period of no more than three years.  The Purchase Agreement expressly provided that \"[d]isputes arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration....\"  Though not mentioned in the Purchase Agreement, the parties apparently understood that Theta II, in addition to paying McCarthy a prescribed sum of money for the transferred rights, would offer him employment under a separate long-term contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1990, McCarthy and Theta II executed a second agreement (the Confidentiality Agreement).  Azure signed the Confidentiality Agreement, as he had signed the Purchase Agreement, on behalf of Theta II, but not otherwise;  indeed, neither document contained a line for Azure's personal signature.  Pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, McCarthy promised to keep all past and future information pertaining to the patents in the bosom of the lodge, and to take certain related actions on behalf of Theta II.  This agreement included a somewhat more expansive arbitration clause, which stated that \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof, shall be settled by arbitration....\"  At a closing held the next day, Theta II delivered a letter (the Employment Letter) engaging McCarthy as its president, chief engineer, and chief executive officer at a stipulated annual salary.  The Employment Letter also provided for stock options.  It did not include an arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A little over two weeks after the closing, matters took a turn for the bizarre (or, at least, for the mystical).  On January 28, 1990, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Azure's spiritual leader, informed him, on the advice of a \"dead ascended master\" of C.U.T., that his newly acquired business was incompatible with his \"divine plan\" and that he should not devote further energy to the enterprise.  Azure dutifully directed McCarthy to cashier all the employees of Theta II, and then proceeded to terminate McCarthy's employment.  McCarthy never obtained any ownership interest in Theta II, notwithstanding the promises contained in the Employment Letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently, Azure's religious convictions took him so far, and no further.  He not only continued operating the Theta corporations, but also formed a third company, Omega Corporation.  In October of 1990, after Azure merged Theta I into Theta II, Omega acquired the surviving entity.  The following July, it began selling shares to the public.  For all intents and purposes, Omega's business seemed indistinguishable from that of Theta I and Theta II;  Omega styled itself as a leader in underground storage and marketed tanks manufactured pursuant to McCarthy's patented technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unwilling to turn the other cheek, McCarthy sued Azure, Theta II, Omega, C.U.T., and Prophet in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Azure, Theta II, and Omega filed a motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration, contending that the serial agreements obligated plaintiff to arbitrate all claims.  The district court granted the motion with respect to Theta II, but denied it as to the remaining movants.  Azure appeals the district court's order refusing to stay the action against him.  We have jurisdiction by virtue of 9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1) (Supp.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below reasoned that the source of appellant's purported right to compel arbitration must be found, if at all, in the Purchase Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  It then denied appellant's motion to stay on the ground that he was not a party to the Purchase Agreement and, therefore, could not compel arbitration of claims lodged against him personally, whether or not those claims related to that agreement.  Azure's appeal tests this thesis.  Because the appeal presents a question of law, appellate review is plenary.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471 (1st Cir.1994);  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>A. General Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with bedrock:  \"arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\"  AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 1418, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986), quoting United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navig.  Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1352-53, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960).  Thus, a party seeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must show, at a bare minimum, that the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This imperative is in no way inconsistent with the acknowledged \"federal policy favoring arbitration.\"  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.  Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983);  see also Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 226, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 2337, 96 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987).  The federal policy presumes proof of a preexisting agreement to arbitrate disputes arising between the protagonists.  Once that agreement has been proven and the protagonists identified, cases such as Cone and McMahon instruct courts to use a particular hermeneutical principle for interpreting the breadth of the agreement;  that is, if the contract language chosen by the parties is unclear as to the nature of the claims to which an agreement to arbitrate extends, a \"healthy regard\" for the federal policy favoring arbitration requires that \"any doubts concerning the scope of an arbitrable issue be resolved in favor of arbitration.\"  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 24-25, 103 S.Ct. at 941.   The federal policy, however, does not extend to situations in which the identity of the parties who have agreed to arbitrate is unclear.  See Painewebber, Inc. v. Hartmann, 921 F.2d 507, 511 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that \"[a]s a matter of contract, no party can be forced to arbitrate unless that party has entered into an agreement to do so\").  Thus, requiring that arbitration rest on a consensual foundation is wholly consistent with federal policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement also makes perfect sense.  Subject matter jurisdiction over an action or series of claims can be conceptualized as conferring a personal right on the parties to have that action, or those claims, adjudicated in a judicial forum.  See, e.g., Pacemaker Diag.  Clinic of America, Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc., 725 F.2d 537, 541 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc) (recognizing that the \"federal litigant has a personal right, subject to exceptions in certain classes of cases, to demand Article III adjudication of a civil suit\");  accord Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 536, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 1465, 8 L.Ed.2d 671 (1962).  Though a person may, by contract, waive his or her right to adjudication, see 9 U.S.C. Sec. 2, there can be no waiver in the absence of an agreement signifying an assent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>B. Framing the Issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the question before us reduces to a matter of contract interpretation:  Did plaintiff, in executing the Purchase Agreement, agree to arbitrate disputes he might have with Azure personally concerning Theta-related transactions?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This question, which involves the interpretation of an arbitration provision touching upon matters of interstate commerce, must be resolved according to federal law.  See McGregor v. Industrial Excess Landfill, Inc., 856 F.2d 39, 46 n. 2 (6th Cir.1988);  Letizia v. Prudential Bache Securities, Inc., 802 F.2d 1185, 1187 (9th Cir.1986);  see also 9 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  As under general principles of contract law, the final answer to such a question is ordinarily a function of the parties' intent as expressed in the language of the contract documents.  See NRM Corp. v. Hercules, Inc., 758 F.2d 676, 681 (D.C.Cir.1985) (explaining that contract interpretation, under federal law, \"dovetails precisely with general principles of contract law,\" such that, under both, \"the judicial task in construing a contract is to give effect to the mutual intentions of the parties\");  see also Local 1199 v. Brooks Drug Co., 956 F.2d 22, 25 (2d Cir.1992) (determining the parties' intent is the essential inquiry);  S.A. Mineracao da Trinidade-Samitri v. Utah Int'l, Inc., 745 F.2d 190, 193 (2d Cir.1984) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that state law is an irrelevancy.  In general, federal courts developing federal common law are free to borrow from state law, unless there is either a demonstrated need for a uniform national rule or a significant conflict between state law and some discernible federal policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 728-30, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 1458-59, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no overt indication that the parties intended to commit claims against appellant, as an individual, to an arbitral forum.  After all, appellant signed the Purchase Agreement solely in his capacity as an agent for a disclosed principal--that is, as \"Chairman\" of Theta II--and not in his personal capacity;  and it is settled beyond peradventure that a person signing a contract only in a corporate capacity, and unambiguously indicating that fact on the face of the contract documents, does not thereby become a party to the agreement.  See, e.g., New York Ass'n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Keator, 606 N.Y.S.2d 784, 785 (App.Div.1993) (finding corporation, but not individual, bound when president of corporation signed contract only on a line indicating his official capacity);  Central Ill.  Pub. Serv.  Corp. v. Molinarolo, 223 Ill.App.3d 471, 165 Ill.Dec. 803, 807, 585 N.E.2d 199, 203 (1992) (holding company, but not individual, liable \"[w]hen an agent signs a document and indicates next to his signature his corporation affiliation\");  Salzman Sign Co. v. Back, 10 N.Y.2d 63, 217 N.Y.S.2d 55, 56-58, 176 N.E.2d 74, 76 (1961) (finding no individual liability where defendant signed only as president of corporation and did not otherwise explicitly indicate in the contract an intent to be bound personally);  cf. Dulik v. Amante, 173 A.D.2d 674, 570 N.Y.S.2d 590, 591 (1991) (finding that a party, by signing the agreement twice, intended to bind both his corporation and himself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the law recognizes certain contract and agency principles under which nonsignatories sometimes can be obligated by, or benefit from, agreements signed by others, and these principles can apply to arbitration provisions.  See, e.g., In re Oil Spill by Amoco Cadiz, 659 F.2d 789, 795-96 (7th Cir.1981);  Fisser v. International Bank, 282 F.2d 231, 233-34 (2d Cir.1960) (collecting cases).  Thus, appellant's failure to sign the Purchase Agreement individually does not in and of itself settle the somewhat different question of whether he can invoke the arbitration clause contained therein.  Seizing on this possibility, appellant charts three routes by which he, as a nonsignatory, might achieve the sanctuary he desires.  In the succeeding sections, we trace these routes and explain why we find them to be blind alleys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>C. Appellant's Agency Theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's most heralded claim is that, as a disclosed agent of Theta II, he is entitled to enforce the arbitration provision included in his principal's agreement with the plaintiff.  He buttresses this claim by citation to authority from several other courts of appeals.  See Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, 7 F.3d 1110, 1121 (3d Cir.1993);  Roby v. Corporation of Lloyd's, 996 F.2d 1353, 1360 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 385, 126 L.Ed.2d 333 (1993);  Arnold v. Arnold Corp., 920 F.2d 1269, 1282 (6th Cir.1990);  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188.   We think appellant's reading of these cases is overly sanguine and that his claim is insupportable for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Comparing Apples to Oranges.   To put appellant's theorem into focus, we first must clarify the animating principles that drive the cases on which the theorem rests.  Doing so persuades us that appellant is comparing apples to oranges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is a superficial similarity between the precedents on which appellant relies and the situation at hand.  In each of the four cited cases, the court gave a nonsignatory the benefit of an arbitration clause signed by the corporate entity for which he or she worked.  In three of these cases, however, the defendant was sued qua employee and the court specifically found that, as a matter of contract interpretation, the parties intended the arbitration provision to cover employees.  See Roby, 996 F.2d at 1360 (observing that \"the parties fully intended to protect the individual Chairs to the extent they are charged with misconduct within the scope of the agreements\");  Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1282 (explaining that \"the language of the arbitration agreement indicates that the parties' basic intent was to provide a single arbitral forum to all disputes arising under the stock purchase agreement\");  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188 (determining that the company \"clearly indicated its intention to protect its employees\" by means of the arbitration provision).  The fourth case also rested largely on contract language.  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (noting the breadth of language used in formulating the arbitration clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, as opposed to the cases marshalled by appellant, the arbitration clause fails to indicate the corporate signatory's intention to protect employees through arbitration, see Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188, and the very nature of the Purchase Agreement, as contrasted to the agreements underlying the other cases, explains why, in this situation, one would naturally expect such protection to be absent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, the cases hawked by appellant involve disputes growing out of service contracts between individuals and financial institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (involving handling of cash management account);  Roby, 996 F.2d at 1357 (involving insurance underwriting);  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1186 (involving handling of securities account).  The claims diverted to arbitration in those cases--and in other cases that appellant could have, but did not, rely upon, see, e.g., Lee v. Chica, 983 F.2d 883, 887 (8th Cir.1993);  Scher v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., 723 F.Supp. 211, 216 (S.D.N.Y.1989)--were, without exception, in the nature of professional malpractice.  Thus, each related directly to the essence of the service contract that the consumer-plaintiff had signed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Purchase Agreement is at a considerable remove;  it is primarily concerned with a transfer of assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The distinction is an important one.  A person who enters into a service contract with a firm contemplates an ongoing relationship in which the firm's promises only can be fulfilled by future (unspecified) acts of its employees or agents stretching well into an uncertain future.  A person who contracts to transfer assets to a company faces a much different prospect:  a one-shot transaction in which the purchaser's obligations are specified and are, essentially, performed in full at the closing, or soon thereafter.  So it is here.  And because the Purchase Agreement cannot easily be construed to refer to the operations of, or services rendered by, Theta II, that company's employees cannot plausibly be included by implication within the ambit of either the agreement or its arbitration clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Scope of the Arbitration Clause.   Close textual analysis supports the conclusion that the Purchase Agreement's arbitration clause should be read more narrowly than the clauses in the cases upon which appellant relies.  The Purchase Agreement provides that disputes \"arising under\" the agreement will be subject to arbitration.  This language is considerably more confining than that employed in other contracts to which appellant alludes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (agreeing to arbitrate \"all controversies which may arise between us, including but not limited to ... this or any other agreement between us, whether entered into prior, or subsequent to the date hereof\");  Roby, 996 F.2d at 1361 (agreeing to arbitrate any \"dispute, difference, question or claim relating to \" the agreements for \"all purposes of and in connection with \" them) (emphasis in original);  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1186 (agreeing to arbitrate disputes \"arising out of or relating to\" plaintiff's securities account).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumscribed nature of the Purchase Agreement's arbitration provision stands out in bold relief when one compares it with the arbitration provision in the Confidentiality Agreement.  Whereas the former directs arbitration only of \"[d]isputes arising under [the agreement]\" (emphasis supplied), the latter directs arbitration of \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to [the agreement]\" (emphasis supplied).  Although the Purchase Agreement's arbitration clause might arguably be read more broadly if it were the only provision extant, see, e.g., Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1271;  Martin Marietta Alum., Inc. v. General Elec. Co., 586 F.2d 143, 145, 147-48 (9th Cir.1978), the use of significantly different language in two clauses, sculpted by the same parties during the same negotiations as part of the same overall transaction, strongly suggests that the signatories intended the arbitration provisions to be of different scope.  See Appalachian Ins. Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 214 Cal.App.3d 1, 262 Cal.Rptr. 716, 725 (Ct.App.1989) (holding that \"[t]o ignore the differences in language used in the two agreements would violate a fundamental rule of contract interpretation, that is, the words of a contract, if clear, must govern its interpretation\");  see also Triple-A Baseball Club Assoc. v. Northeastern Baseball, Inc., 832 F.2d 214, 221-22 (1st Cir.1987) (adopting narrow construction where a contract did not include relatively broad language found in the parties' earlier drafts), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 935, 108 S.Ct. 1111, 99 L.Ed.2d 272 (1988);  C &amp; M Realty Trust v. Wiedenkeller, 133 N.H. 470, 578 A.2d 354, 357 (1990) (declaring that a court's role is to interpret contracts in accordance with the parties' intent discernible at the time of agreement, as measured by objective criteria).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intent to limit arbitral rights to signatories is also made manifest by the inclusion of an integration clause in the Purchase Agreement.  The integration clause states that the written agreement \"represents the entire understanding of the parties\" and \"supersedes all other understandings, arrangements and negotiations.\"   We, and other courts, routinely have declined to read unwritten terms into agreements containing similar declarations.  See, e.g., Bidlack v. Wheelabrator Corp., 993 F.2d 603, 608 (7th Cir.)  (explaining that an integration clause is an \"indication of the parties' desire to limit a free-ranging judicial discretion to interpolate terms\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 291, 126 L.Ed.2d 240 (1993);  Northern Heel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc., 851 F.2d 456, 466 (1st Cir.1988) (similar).  Applying that time-honored principle here, it would be wrong to widen the arbitration clause to include the signatories' agents and employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Purchase Agreement itself is the best indicator of the parties' intent.  We must honor that intent--an intent which, for our purposes, translates into a direction to read the arbitration clause set forth in the Purchase Agreement straightforwardly rather than expansively.  Operating in this mode, it is difficult to see how a lawsuit between the seller and a nonsignatory who is not a successor in interest to the buyer's rights can be said to \"aris[e] under\" the Purchase Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Thus, appellant's effort to compel plaintiff to arbitrate cannot succeed, for, \"as a matter of contract, no party can be forced to arbitrate unless that party has entered an agreement to do so.\"  Painewebber, 921 F.2d at 511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Individual Capacity/Official Capacity Schism.   For present purposes, we regard the distinction between Azure, in his personal capacity, and Azure, in his representative capacity, as possessing decretory significance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Not coincidentally, in each of the four cases relied on by appellant the court confronted a situation in which the claim asserted related to actions undertaken by a corporate representative in his or her official, rather than personal, capacity;  and each of the courts based its holding on this circumstance.  See Roby, 996 F.2d at 1360 (concluding that the \"complaints against the individual Chairs are completely dependent on the complaints against the [principals] ... [and] arise[ ] out of the same misconduct charged against the [principals]\");  Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1282 (similar);   see also Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (reciting facts demonstrating that the nonsignatory was being sued for acts within the scope of her role as an agent of the signatory corporation);   Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188 (finding that all the individual defendants' allegedly wrongful acts related to their employment responsibilities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contradistinction, plaintiff asserts claims against Azure in his personal, rather than his corporate, capacity.  See supra note 4.  This is no mere semantic quibble.  An official capacity suit is, in essence, \"another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\"  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (citations omitted).  Consequently, such a suit \"is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\"  Id. at 166, 105 S.Ct. at 3105.   By contrast, personal capacity suits proceed against the individual, not against the entity with which the individual is affiliated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the corporate context, personal capacity actions can take several forms, including by way of illustration claims alleging ultra vires conduct, see, e.g., Expomotion, Ltd. v. Heidepriem-Santandrea Inc., 101 Misc.2d 593, 421 N.Y.S.2d 520, 521 (Civ.Ct.1979);  tort suits in which a corporate officer or agent, though operating within the scope of corporate authorization, \"through his or her own fault injures another to whom he or she owes a personal duty,\" 3A William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations Sec. 1135, at 66-67 (1986 ed. &amp; Supp.1992);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  and, of more immediate applicability, suits alleging that a person affiliated with a corporation created or manipulated it as part of a larger (fraudulent) scheme, see, e.g., Dietel v. Day, 16 Ariz.App. 206, 492 P.2d 455, 457-58 (1972) (explaining that \"[i]f a corporation was formed or is employed for fraudulent purposes,\" personal liability may be imposed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, apparent that drawing a distinction between individual capacity and representative capacity claims is to draw a distinction that portends a meaningful legal difference.  Indeed, the distinction between claims aimed at a defendant in his individual as opposed to representative capacity can be found across the law.  See, e.g., Stafford v. Briggs, 444 U.S. 527, 544, 100 S.Ct. 774, 784-85, 63 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980) (distinguishing between individual and official capacity claims for purposes of venue determination);  Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159, 28 S.Ct. 441, 453-54, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) (distinguishing between individual and official capacity acts for Eleventh Amendment purposes);  Northeast Fed.  Credit Union v. Neves, 837 F.2d 531, 534 (1st Cir.1988) (distinguishing between individual and official capacity claims for jurisdictional purposes);  Pelkoffer v. Deer, 144 B.R. 282, 285-86 (W.D.Pa.1992) (applying same distinction in bankruptcy context);  see also Graham, 473 U.S. at 165, 105 S.Ct. at 3104-05 (indicating differences between individual and official capacity claims for purposes of suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983);  Estabrook v. Wetmore, 129 N.H. 520, 529 A.2d 956, 958 (1987) (applying doctrine that acts of a corporate employee performed in his corporate capacity generally do not form the basis for personal jurisdiction over him in his individual capacity).  The ubiquity of the distinction is a reflection of the reality that individuals in our complex society frequently act on behalf of other parties--a reality that often makes it unfair to credit or blame the actor, individually, for such acts.  At the same time, the law strikes a wise balance by refusing automatically to saddle a principal with total responsibility for a representative's conduct, come what may, and by declining mechanically to limit an injured party's recourse to the principal alone, regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant suggests that policy considerations counsel against giving credence to the distinction between a corporate officer's personal and representative capacities.  He asserts that, by honoring the distinction, we will enable wily plaintiffs to circumvent arbitration provisions to which they previously had agreed.  To prevent such end runs, appellant says, agents and employees must be allowed to stand in the principal's stead for the purpose of invoking arbitration clauses.  See Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1281.   We believe that policy considerations, placed in proper perspective, tilt in the opposite direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, to the extent that appellant's professed fear of artful pleading is genuine, the best preventative is to act before, rather than after, the fact;  to be blunt, judicial juggling is a far less effective anodyne than skillful drafting of contract documents in the first instance.  A corporation that wishes to bring its agents and employees into the arbitral tent can do so by writing contracts in general, and arbitration clauses in particular, in ways that will specify the desired result.  See, e.g., Roby, 996 F.2d at 1361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, whether a claim properly lies against a party in his personal capacity or in his official capacity is ultimately a function of the facts, not of pleading techniques alone.  Mechanisms exist for dealing with groundless, overstated, or elliptical claims.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 11;  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927 (1988) (granting courts the power to charge \"excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred\" due to \"unreasonabl[e] and vexatious[ ]\" conduct);  Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 631-32 (1st Cir.1990);  see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2131-38, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (discussing federal court's inherent power to impose sanctions for abusive litigation practices);  Foster v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 141-45 (1st Cir.1991) (discussing range of sanctions available for prosecution of frivolous claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we are doubtful that the incentive to plead deceitfully exists at all.  Arbitration is almost invariably a creature of contract, and an agent is not ordinarily liable for his principal's breach of contract.  See, e.g., Mastropieri v. Solmar Constr.  Co., 159 A.D.2d 698, 553 N.Y.S.2d 187, 188 (1990) (\"It is well settled that when an agent acts on behalf of a disclosed principal, the agent will not be personally liable for a breach of the contract, unless there is clear and explicit evidence of the agent's intention to be bound.\");   see also Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 328 (1958) (\"An agent, by making a contract only on behalf of a competent disclosed ... principal whom he has power so to bind, does not thereby become liable for its nonperformance.\").  Thus, manipulating the reality of events in order to bring suit against the agent holds only marginal promise of financial reward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps most important from a policy standpoint, adopting appellant's proposal would introduce a troubling asymmetry into the law.  It is common ground that \"[s]igning an arbitration agreement as agent for a disclosed principal is not sufficient to bind the agent to arbitrate claims against him personally.\"  Flink v. Carlson, 856 F.2d 44, 46 (8th Cir.1988);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  accord Interocean Ship.  Co. v. Nat'l Ship. &amp; Trading Corp., 523 F.2d 527, 538 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1054, 96 S.Ct. 785, 46 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976);  see also Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 320.  In appellant's scenario, then, the agent, though he could not be compelled to arbitrate, nonetheless could compel the claimant to submit to arbitration.  In other words, an agent for a disclosed principal would enjoy the benefits of the principal's arbitral agreement, but would shoulder none of the corresponding burdens.  He would have found a way, contrary to folklore, to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  In our view, judges should think long and hard before endorsing a rule that will allow a party to use the courts to vindicate his rights while at the same time foreclosing his adversary from comparable access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, for instance, appellant insists that the law empowers him to shunt McCarthy's claims into an arbitral forum, despite the fact that, if the shoe were on the other foot, McCarthy could not force appellant to arbitrate those claims--or any other claims, for that matter.  Though the law is not always perfectly proportional, this lack of mutuality of obligation is disturbing, particularly as it arises in a contractual context.  See generally Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994) (discussing rule that mutuality of obligation is a prerequisite to a binding bilateral contract;  citing numerous cases and other authorities);  Smith, Batchelder &amp; Rugg v. Foster, 119 N.H. 679, 406 A.2d 1310, 1312 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Nature of the Claims.   It is also worth noting, for the sake of completeness, that the bulk of plaintiff's claims are litigable in any event simply because they fall outside the ambit of the Purchase Agreement's closely tailored arbitration clause.  For example, the claims for breach of contract and wrongful discharge concern plaintiff's employment rights.  Those rights are not mentioned at all in the Purchase Agreement.  To the contrary, they come within the purview of the Employment Letter--a document that conspicuously omits any arbitration provision.  Similarly, many aspects of plaintiff's claims of fraud, misrepresentation, emotional distress, unfair trade practices, and racketeering relate to his employment rights, and, to that extent, also do not implicate the Purchase Agreement's arbitration provision.  And while the remaining claims touch upon the Purchase Agreement, they do not uniformly \"aris[e] under\" it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No useful purpose would be served by reciting book and verse.  It suffices to say that, even if Azure were a party to the contract that contains the operative arbitration provision, he would not be entitled as of right to an order staying litigation of all--or even most of--McCarthy's claims.  See 9 U.S.C. Sec. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>D. Appellant's Third-Party Beneficiary Theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next posits that, as a third-party beneficiary of the Purchase Agreement's arbitration clause, he can compel plaintiff to arbitrate.  This claim also fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is generally the case in matters of contract interpretation, \"[t]he crux in third-party beneficiary analysis ... is the intent of the parties.\"  Mowbray v. Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook &amp; Weeden, 795 F.2d 1111, 1117 (1st Cir.1986).  Because third-party beneficiary status constitutes an exception to the general rule that a contract does not grant enforceable rights to nonsignatories, see, e.g., Arlington Trust Co. v. Estate of Wood, 123 N.H. 765, 465 A.2d 917, 918 (1993), a person aspiring to such status must show with special clarity that the contracting parties intended to confer a benefit on him.  See Mowbray, 795 F.2d at 1117;  Arlington Trust, 465 A.2d at 918;  Tamposi Assocs. v. Star Mkt. Co., 119 N.H. 630, 406 A.2d 132, 134 (1979);  see generally 3 E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts Sec. 10.3, at 22-23 (1990);  4 Arthur Corbin, Contracts Sec. 776 (1951).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we are unable to discern any indication in the Purchase Agreement that the parties meant to make their respective agents or employees third-party beneficiaries.  Neither Azure nor any other employee of Theta II is mentioned explicitly in the Purchase Agreement;  there are no meaningful categorical references;  the critical provision in the contract, see supra note 11, omits any mention of agents and employees;  and we can find no principled basis for including Azure by necessary implication (especially since the contract contains an integration clause).  These facts strongly militate against conferring third-party beneficiary status upon a corporate officer with respect to arbitration rights.  See Shaffer v. Stratton Oakmont, Inc., 756 F.Supp. 365, 369 (N.D.Ill.1991) (refusing to find a third-party beneficiary relationship generating an obligation to arbitrate in analogous circumstances);  Lester v. Basner, 676 F.Supp. 481, 484-85 (S.D.N.Y.1987) (refusing to find an obligation to arbitrate under a third-party beneficiary theory when the contract itself \"is silent as to whether [its] terms\" apply to the purported third-party beneficiaries).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is equally devoid of anything that might intimate a course of dealing between McCarthy, Theta II, and Azure from which an intent to create third-party beneficiaries plausibly could be inferred.  See Mowbray, 795 F.2d at 1117.   And, finally, the Purchase Agreement neither calls for any performance by the promisor (McCarthy) that will satisfy some obligation owed by the promisee (Theta II) to the putative third party, nor is it \"so expressed as to give the promisor reason to know that a benefit to a third party is contemplated by the promisee as one of the motivating causes of his making the contract.\"  Tamposi, 406 A.2d at 134.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to polish a star.  For the reasons indicated, appellant's thrust for relief on the ground that he is a third-party beneficiary of Theta II's agreement to arbitrate falls short.  See Mowbray, 795 F.2d at 1117;  Shaffer, 756 F.Supp. at 369;  Lester, 676 F.Supp. at 485;  Tamposi, 406 A.2d at 134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>E. Appellant's Alter Ego Theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy's complaint alleges, at one point, that Azure is the alter ego of Theta II.  The last shot in appellant's sling derives from this allegation:  he asseverates that he should be accorded the right to demand arbitration based on the asserted equivalence between him and his corporate principal.  This shot exhibits a basic misunderstanding of the weapon appellant has selected.  Not surprisingly, it misses the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alter ego doctrine is equitable in nature.  See, e.g., Harrell v. DCS Equip.  Leasing Corp., 951 F.2d 1453, 1458 (5th Cir.1992);  St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Comp. v. Pepsico, Inc., 884 F.2d 688, 697 (2d Cir.1989);  1 Fletcher, supra, Sec. 41.25.  As such, the doctrine can be invoked \"only where equity requires the action to assist a third party.\"   1 Fletcher, supra, at Sec. 41.10;  see also In re Rehabilitation of Centaur Ins. Co., 238 Ill.App.3d 292, 179 Ill.Dec. 459, 464, 606 N.E.2d 291, 296 (1992) (barring a subsidiary from piercing its own corporate veil in order to reach its parent because \"the equitable remedy lies with third parties\"), aff'd, 158 Ill.2d 166, 198 Ill.Dec. 404, 632 N.E.2d 1015 (1994);  Village Press, Inc. v. Stephen Edward Comp., Inc., 120 N.H. 469, 416 A.2d 1373, 1375 (1980) (holding that, to employ the alter ego doctrine, \"the plaintiff must establish that the corporate entity was used to promote an injustice or fraud\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law that appellant touts earns him no indulgence.  Without exception, these cases involve instances in which an allegedly aggrieved party has sought to compel a person or entity thought to be a corporate signatory's alter ego to abide by an arbitration clause.  Typical of the genre is Fisser, a case holding that \"if the parent is bound to the contract, then its marionette [the alleged alter ego] is bound to submit to arbitration.\"  282 F.2d at 234-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confronted with a much different situation.  In this case, the supposed wrongdoer seeks to invoke the alter ego doctrine in order to hide behind the corporate entity, that is, to avail himself of the corporation's right to repair to an arbitral forum and thereby avoid a jury trial.  As appellant is not even arguably an innocent third party disadvantaged by someone else's blurring of the line between a corporation and the person who controls it, but, rather, is himself the one who is claimed to have obscured the line, he cannot be permitted to use the alter ego designation to his own behoof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Although the Purchase Agreement does contain an arbitration clause, it is narrow in scope and does not extend the right to compel arbitration to agents or employees of the corporate signatory.  By like token, the Purchase Agreement does not make manifest an intention to confer third-party beneficiary status on any such agents or employees.  And, finally, appellant cannot rely on plaintiff's alter ego claim to draw an equivalence between himself and his corporate principal for his own benefit.  In sum, there is no contractual or other legal lever by which appellant can force plaintiff to arbitrate the \"individual capacity\" claims that are the subject of the underlying suit.  Because this is so, the district court appropriately refused to grant the relief that appellant requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order appealed from is affirmed and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  The motions pending in this court are denied without prejudice to their renewal below.  Costs in favor of appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Apart from McCarthy and Theta II, other parties to the Purchase Agreement included the passive investors and three major creditors of Theta I.  For present purposes, nothing turns on the involvement of the other parties</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint asserted claims against Azure, Theta II, and Omega for, inter alia, breach of contract, wrongful discharge, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unfair trade practices, federal and state securities violations, and racketeering.  It also asserted claims against Azure, C.U.T., and Prophet for tortious interference with contractual relationships.  Jurisdiction was premised on the existence of both federal questions, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 (1988), and diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a)(1) (1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the Confidentiality Agreement granted legal rights only to Theta II and not to McCarthy, we agree with the district court's conclusion that it could not furnish a basis for precluding access to a judicial forum in respect to claims asserted by McCarthy against Azure.  For that reason, and for the added reason that appellant, individually, was not a signatory to the Confidentiality Agreement, our analysis revolves around the Purchase Agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although plaintiff originally sued Azure in two capacities (individual and official), plaintiff agreed, following oral argument in this court, to abandon his \"official capacity\" claims against Azure.  Given this agreement, plaintiff henceforth will be disabled from pursuing any such claims.   See United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 792-93 (1st Cir.)  (explicating doctrine of judicial estoppel), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 894, 109 S.Ct. 232, 102 L.Ed.2d 222 (1988);   Patriot Cinemas Inc. v. General Cinema, Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 211-15 (1st Cir.1987) (similar).  Consequently, we deal in this opinion only with plaintiff's \"individual capacity\" claims against Azure</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> When state law is likely to prove an appropriate model, but different states have an interest in the claim, it is reasonable for a federal court to apply the choice-of-law principles of the forum in order to ascertain what state's substantive law should be consulted.  Cf., e.g., Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496-97, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 1021-22, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941);  Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, our task is simplified:  the Purchase Agreement contains a provision directing the reader to New Hampshire law.  Because a reasonable choice-of-law provision in a contract generally should be respected, see Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws Sec. 187 (1971);   see also Ferrofluidics Corp. v. Advanced Vacuum Components, Inc., 968 F.2d 1463, 1467 (1st Cir.1992) (applying New Hampshire choice-of-law principles);   Allied Adjustment Serv. v. Heney, 125 N.H. 698, 484 A.2d 1189, 1190-91 (1948) (stating that the parties' selection of the law of a particular jurisdiction will be honored so long as \"the contract bears any significant relationship to that jurisdiction\"), we will from time to time consult New Hampshire law for guidance.  Where New Hampshire law is recondite, we will turn to the types of materials that we believe the New Hampshire Supreme Court would look to in formulating new law.   See Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 (1st Cir.1987) (describing materials);   see also Kathios v. General Motors Corp., 862 F.2d 944, 949 (1st Cir.1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The solitary exception is Arnold.

As we have made pellucid, see supra p. 355, the basic prerequisite is the parties' agreement to arbitrate, or, put another way, the existence of an actual waiver of the right to litigate.  But similarity of claims sometimes may help to clarify what the parties intended when they included an arbitration provision in an instrument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> While one section of the Purchase Agreement describes the sellers' retention of a right to purchase products from Theta II at preferential prices and to distribute those products in New England, appellant has not argued that any of McCarthy's claims implicate this distribution provision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although we do not decide the point, we note that even an implied reference likely would not suffice as a predicate for enforced arbitration.

See Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1271.   But in Arnold, unlike in this case, the stated clause comprised the only arbitration provision at issue, thus making it much easier to read the language broadly.  See infra pp. 15-16 (discussing interpretive significance of dual agreements) and cases cited.

Flink, 856 F.2d at 46 (emphasis supplied).  Lee left this legal rule fully intact.  Lee, unlike Frank, merely involved the by-now routine investment service contract context, a situation where additional factors, including \"the plain language of the arbitration clause,\" showed that claims against the agent appropriately were subject to arbitration.

The district court refused to order arbitration under these circumstances.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, the facts can be taken essentially as alleged.  In 1987, plaintiff-appellee Walton W. McCarthy, a renowned inventor of underground shelter technology, incorporated T.H.E.T.A. Technologies, Inc.  (Theta I), a New Hampshire corporation, for the purpose of manufacturing underground storage tanks and personal shelters.  McCarthy owned fifty percent of the corporation's stock and served as its principal operating officer.  Three passive investors held the remaining shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1989, McCarthy met defendant-appellant Leo L. Azure, Jr., a member of a Montana-based religious organization, Church Universal &amp; Triumphant (C.U.T.).  Azure soon entered into negotiations for the acquisition of both McCarthy's company and patented technology.  Azure formed a Washington corporation, Theta Corporation (Theta II), to serve as a vehicle for the planned purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1989, McCarthy, Theta II, and others entered into a contract (the Purchase Agreement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Azure signed the Purchase Agreement on behalf of Theta II, but he did not sign it in his personal capacity.  Leaving to one side special arrangements with various creditors, see supra note 1, this contract delineated a two-phase transaction:  McCarthy was to sell his equity interest, including the patents, to the passive investors, and transfer certain residual rights to Theta II;  then, Theta II was to buy all the outstanding stock of Theta I for cash, payable over a period of no more than three years.  The Purchase Agreement expressly provided that \"[d]isputes arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration....\"  Though not mentioned in the Purchase Agreement, the parties apparently understood that Theta II, in addition to paying McCarthy a prescribed sum of money for the transferred rights, would offer him employment under a separate long-term contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1990, McCarthy and Theta II executed a second agreement (the Confidentiality Agreement).  Azure signed the Confidentiality Agreement, as he had signed the Purchase Agreement, on behalf of Theta II, but not otherwise;  indeed, neither document contained a line for Azure's personal signature.  Pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, McCarthy promised to keep all past and future information pertaining to the patents in the bosom of the lodge, and to take certain related actions on behalf of Theta II.  This agreement included a somewhat more expansive arbitration clause, which stated that \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach hereof, shall be settled by arbitration....\"  At a closing held the next day, Theta II delivered a letter (the Employment Letter) engaging McCarthy as its president, chief engineer, and chief executive officer at a stipulated annual salary.  The Employment Letter also provided for stock options.  It did not include an arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A little over two weeks after the closing, matters took a turn for the bizarre (or, at least, for the mystical).  On January 28, 1990, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Azure's spiritual leader, informed him, on the advice of a \"dead ascended master\" of C.U.T., that his newly acquired business was incompatible with his \"divine plan\" and that he should not devote further energy to the enterprise.  Azure dutifully directed McCarthy to cashier all the employees of Theta II, and then proceeded to terminate McCarthy's employment.  McCarthy never obtained any ownership interest in Theta II, notwithstanding the promises contained in the Employment Letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently, Azure's religious convictions took him so far, and no further.  He not only continued operating the Theta corporations, but also formed a third company, Omega Corporation.  In October of 1990, after Azure merged Theta I into Theta II, Omega acquired the surviving entity.  The following July, it began selling shares to the public.  For all intents and purposes, Omega's business seemed indistinguishable from that of Theta I and Theta II;  Omega styled itself as a leader in underground storage and marketed tanks manufactured pursuant to McCarthy's patented technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unwilling to turn the other cheek, McCarthy sued Azure, Theta II, Omega, C.U.T., and Prophet in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Azure, Theta II, and Omega filed a motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration, contending that the serial agreements obligated plaintiff to arbitrate all claims.  The district court granted the motion with respect to Theta II, but denied it as to the remaining movants.  Azure appeals the district court's order refusing to stay the action against him.  We have jurisdiction by virtue of 9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1) (Supp.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below reasoned that the source of appellant's purported right to compel arbitration must be found, if at all, in the Purchase Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  It then denied appellant's motion to stay on the ground that he was not a party to the Purchase Agreement and, therefore, could not compel arbitration of claims lodged against him personally, whether or not those claims related to that agreement.  Azure's appeal tests this thesis.  Because the appeal presents a question of law, appellate review is plenary.  See United States v.

Thus, a party seeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must show, at a bare minimum, that the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This imperative is in no way inconsistent with the acknowledged \"federal policy favoring arbitration.\"  Moses H.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span> (1987).  The federal policy presumes proof of a preexisting agreement to arbitrate disputes arising between the protagonists.  Once that agreement has been proven and the protagonists identified, cases such as Cone and McMahon instruct courts to use a particular hermeneutical principle for interpreting the breadth of the agreement;  that is, if the contract language chosen by the parties is unclear as to the nature of the claims to which an agreement to arbitrate extends, a \"healthy regard\" for the federal policy favoring arbitration requires that \"any doubts concerning the scope of an arbitrable issue be resolved in favor of arbitration.\"  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 24-25, 103 S.Ct. at 941.   The federal policy, however, does not extend to situations in which the identity of the parties who have agreed to arbitrate is unclear.  See Painewebber, Inc. v. Hartmann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553191\"><a href=\"/opinion/553191/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95738-painewebber-incorporated-v-willard-s-hartmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 511 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that \"[a]s a matter of contract, no party can be forced to arbitrate unless that party has entered into an agreement to do so\").  Thus, requiring that arbitration rest on a consensual foundation is wholly consistent with federal policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement also makes perfect sense.  Subject matter jurisdiction over an action or series of claims can be conceptualized as conferring a personal right on the parties to have that action, or those claims, adjudicated in a judicial forum.  See, e.g., Pacemaker Diag.  Clinic of America, Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429819\"><a href=\"/opinion/429819/pacemaker-diagnostic-clinic-of-america-inc-a-corporation-plaintiff-/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 541 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc) (recognizing that the \"federal litigant has a personal right, subject to exceptions in certain classes of cases, to demand Article III adjudication of a civil suit\");  accord Glidden Co. v.

After all, appellant signed the Purchase Agreement solely in his capacity as an agent for a disclosed principal--that is, as \"Chairman\" of Theta II--and not in his personal capacity;  and it is settled beyond peradventure that a person signing a contract only in a corporate capacity, and unambiguously indicating that fact on the face of the contract documents, does not thereby become a party to the agreement.

See, e.g., In re Oil Spill by Amoco Cadiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394152\"><a href=\"/opinion/394152/in-re-oil-spill-by-the-amoco-cadiz-off-the-coast-of-france-march-16/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, 795-96 (7th Cir.1981);  Fisser v.

Thus, appellant's failure to sign the Purchase Agreement individually does not in and of itself settle the somewhat different question of whether he can invoke the arbitration clause contained therein.  Seizing on this possibility, appellant charts three routes by which he, as a nonsignatory, might achieve the sanctuary he desires.

We think appellant's reading of these cases is overly sanguine and that his claim is insupportable for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Comparing Apples to Oranges.   To put appellant's theorem into focus, we first must clarify the animating principles that drive the cases on which the theorem rests.

In each of the four cited cases, the court gave a nonsignatory the benefit of an arbitration clause signed by the corporate entity for which he or she worked.  In three of these cases, however, the defendant was sued qua employee and the court specifically found that, as a matter of contract interpretation, the parties intended the arbitration provision to cover employees.  See Roby, 996 F.2d at 1360 (observing that \"the parties fully intended to protect the individual Chairs to the extent they are charged with misconduct within the scope of the agreements\");  Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1282 (explaining that \"the language of the arbitration agreement indicates that the parties' basic intent was to provide a single arbitral forum to all disputes arising under the stock purchase agreement\");  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188 (determining that the company \"clearly indicated its intention to protect its employees\" by means of the arbitration provision).  The fourth case also rested largely on contract language.  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (noting the breadth of language used in formulating the arbitration clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, as opposed to the cases marshalled by appellant, the arbitration clause fails to indicate the corporate signatory's intention to protect employees through arbitration, see Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188, and the very nature of the Purchase Agreement, as contrasted to the agreements underlying the other cases, explains why, in this situation, one would naturally expect such protection to be absent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, the cases hawked by appellant involve disputes growing out of service contracts between individuals and financial institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (involving handling of cash management account);  Roby, 996 F.2d at 1357 (involving insurance underwriting);  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1186 (involving handling of securities account).  The claims diverted to arbitration in those cases--and in other cases that appellant could have, but did not, rely upon, see, e.g., Lee v. Chica, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597876\"><a href=\"/opinion/597876/in-the-matter-of-arbitration-between-judy-lee-appellantcross-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></a></span>, 887 (8th Cir.1993);  Scher v.

Thus, each related directly to the essence of the service contract that the consumer-plaintiff had signed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Purchase Agreement is at a considerable remove;  it is primarily concerned with a transfer of assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The distinction is an important one.  A person who enters into a service contract with a firm contemplates an ongoing relationship in which the firm's promises only can be fulfilled by future (unspecified) acts of its employees or agents stretching well into an uncertain future.  A person who contracts to transfer assets to a company faces a much different prospect:  a one-shot transaction in which the purchaser's obligations are specified and are, essentially, performed in full at the closing, or soon thereafter.  So it is here.  And because the Purchase Agreement cannot easily be construed to refer to the operations of, or services rendered by, Theta II, that company's employees cannot plausibly be included by implication within the ambit of either the agreement or its arbitration clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Scope of the Arbitration Clause.   Close textual analysis supports the conclusion that the Purchase Agreement's arbitration clause should be read more narrowly than the clauses in the cases upon which appellant relies.  The Purchase Agreement provides that disputes \"arising under\" the agreement will be subject to arbitration.  This language is considerably more confining than that employed in other contracts to which appellant alludes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (agreeing to arbitrate \"all controversies which may arise between us, including but not limited to ... this or any other agreement between us, whether entered into prior, or subsequent to the date hereof\");  Roby, 996 F.2d at 1361 (agreeing to arbitrate any \"dispute, difference, question or claim relating to \" the agreements for \"all purposes of and in connection with \" them) (emphasis in original);  Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1186 (agreeing to arbitrate disputes \"arising out of or relating to\" plaintiff's securities account).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumscribed nature of the Purchase Agreement's arbitration provision stands out in bold relief when one compares it with the arbitration provision in the Confidentiality Agreement.  Whereas the former directs arbitration only of \"[d]isputes arising under [the agreement]\" (emphasis supplied), the latter directs arbitration of \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to [the agreement]\" (emphasis supplied).  Although the Purchase Agreement's arbitration clause might arguably be read more broadly if it were the only provision extant, see, e.g., Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1271;  Martin Marietta Alum., Inc. v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360449\"><a href=\"/opinion/360449/martin-marietta-aluminum-inc-a-california-corporation-v-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 145, 147-48 (9th Cir.1978), the use of significantly different language in two clauses, sculpted by the same parties during the same negotiations as part of the same overall transaction, strongly suggests that the signatories intended the arbitration provisions to be of different scope.  See Appalachian Ins. Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117280\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117280/appalachian-ins-co-v-mcdonnell-douglas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The integration clause states that the written agreement \"represents the entire understanding of the parties\" and \"supersedes all other understandings, arrangements and negotiations.\"   We, and other courts, routinely have declined to read unwritten terms into agreements containing similar declarations.  See, e.g., Bidlack v. Wheelabrator Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606714\"><a href=\"/opinion/606714/kenneth-p-bidlack-v-wheelabrator-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 608 (7th Cir.)

Applying that time-honored principle here, it would be wrong to widen the arbitration clause to include the signatories' agents and employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Purchase Agreement itself is the best indicator of the parties' intent.  We must honor that intent--an intent which, for our purposes, translates into a direction to read the arbitration clause set forth in the Purchase Agreement straightforwardly rather than expansively.  Operating in this mode, it is difficult to see how a lawsuit between the seller and a nonsignatory who is not a successor in interest to the buyer's rights can be said to \"aris[e] under\" the Purchase Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Thus, appellant's effort to compel plaintiff to arbitrate cannot succeed, for, \"as a matter of contract, no party can be forced to arbitrate unless that party has entered an agreement to do so.\"  Painewebber, 921 F.2d at 511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Individual Capacity/Official Capacity Schism.   For present purposes, we regard the distinction between Azure, in his personal capacity, and Azure, in his representative capacity, as possessing decretory significance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Not coincidentally, in each of the four cases relied on by appellant the court confronted a situation in which the claim asserted related to actions undertaken by a corporate representative in his or her official, rather than personal, capacity;  and each of the courts based its holding on this circumstance.  See Roby, 996 F.2d at 1360 (concluding that the \"complaints against the individual Chairs are completely dependent on the complaints against the [principals] ... [and] arise[ ] out of the same misconduct charged against the [principals]\");  Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1282 (similar);   see also Pritzker, 7 F.3d at 1114 (reciting facts demonstrating that the nonsignatory was being sued for acts within the scope of her role as an agent of the signatory corporation);   Letizia, 802 F.2d at 1188 (finding that all the individual defendants' allegedly wrongful acts related to their employment responsibilities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contradistinction, plaintiff asserts claims against Azure in his personal, rather than his corporate, capacity.  See supra note 4.  This is no mere semantic quibble.  An official capacity suit is, in essence, \"another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\"  Kentucky v. Graham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, 165, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span> (1985) (citations omitted).  Consequently, such a suit \"is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\"  Id. at 166, 105 S.Ct. at 3105.   By contrast, personal capacity suits proceed against the individual, not against the entity with which the individual is affiliated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the corporate context, personal capacity actions can take several forms, including by way of illustration claims alleging ultra vires conduct, see, e.g., Expomotion, Ltd. v. Heidepriem-Santandrea Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Misc. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span>, 521 (Civ.Ct.1979);  tort suits in which a corporate officer or agent, though operating within the scope of corporate authorization, \"through his or her own fault injures another to whom he or she owes a personal duty,\" 3A William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations Sec. 1135, at 66-67 (1986 ed. &amp; Supp.1992);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  and, of more immediate applicability, suits alleging that a person affiliated with a corporation created or manipulated it as part of a larger (fraudulent) scheme, see, e.g., Dietel v. Day, 16 Ariz.App. 206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1166086\"><a href=\"/opinion/1166086/dietel-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 457-58 (1972) (explaining that \"[i]f a corporation was formed or is employed for fraudulent purposes,\" personal liability may be imposed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, apparent that drawing a distinction between individual capacity and representative capacity claims is to draw a distinction that portends a meaningful legal difference.  Indeed, the distinction between claims aimed at a defendant in his individual as opposed to representative capacity can be found across the law.  See, e.g., Stafford v.

The ubiquity of the distinction is a reflection of the reality that individuals in our complex society frequently act on behalf of other parties--a reality that often makes it unfair to credit or blame the actor, individually, for such acts.  At the same time, the law strikes a wise balance by refusing automatically to saddle a principal with total responsibility for a representative's conduct, come what may, and by declining mechanically to limit an injured party's recourse to the principal alone, regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant suggests that policy considerations counsel against giving credence to the distinction between a corporate officer's personal and representative capacities.  He asserts that, by honoring the distinction, we will enable wily plaintiffs to circumvent arbitration provisions to which they previously had agreed.  To prevent such end runs, appellant says, agents and employees must be allowed to stand in the principal's stead for the purpose of invoking arbitration clauses.  See Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1281.   We believe that policy considerations, placed in proper perspective, tilt in the opposite direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, to the extent that appellant's professed fear of artful pleading is genuine, the best preventative is to act before, rather than after, the fact;  to be blunt, judicial juggling is a far less effective anodyne than skillful drafting of contract documents in the first instance.  A corporation that wishes to bring its agents and employees into the arbitral tent can do so by writing contracts in general, and arbitration clauses in particular, in ways that will specify the desired result.  See, e.g., Roby, 996 F.2d at 1361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, whether a claim properly lies against a party in his personal capacity or in his official capacity is ultimately a function of the facts, not of pleading techniques alone.  Mechanisms exist for dealing with groundless, overstated, or elliptical claims.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 11;  28 U.S.C.

In appellant's scenario, then, the agent, though he could not be compelled to arbitrate, nonetheless could compel the claimant to submit to arbitration.  In other words, an agent for a disclosed principal would enjoy the benefits of the principal's arbitral agreement, but would shoulder none of the corresponding burdens.  He would have found a way, contrary to folklore, to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  In our view, judges should think long and hard before endorsing a rule that will allow a party to use the courts to vindicate his rights while at the same time foreclosing his adversary from comparable access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, for instance, appellant insists that the law empowers him to shunt McCarthy's claims into an arbitral forum, despite the fact that, if the shoe were on the other foot, McCarthy could not force appellant to arbitrate those claims--or any other claims, for that matter.

The Nature of the Claims.   It is also worth noting, for the sake of completeness, that the bulk of plaintiff's claims are litigable in any event simply because they fall outside the ambit of the Purchase Agreement's closely tailored arbitration clause.  For example, the claims for breach of contract and wrongful discharge concern plaintiff's employment rights.  Those rights are not mentioned at all in the Purchase Agreement.  To the contrary, they come within the purview of the Employment Letter--a document that conspicuously omits any arbitration provision.  Similarly, many aspects of plaintiff's claims of fraud, misrepresentation, emotional distress, unfair trade practices, and racketeering relate to his employment rights, and, to that extent, also do not implicate the Purchase Agreement's arbitration provision.  And while the remaining claims touch upon the Purchase Agreement, they do not uniformly \"aris[e] under\" it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No useful purpose would be served by reciting book and verse.  It suffices to say that, even if Azure were a party to the contract that contains the operative arbitration provision, he would not be entitled as of right to an order staying litigation of all--or even most of--McCarthy's claims.

Because third-party beneficiary status constitutes an exception to the general rule that a contract does not grant enforceable rights to nonsignatories, see, e.g., Arlington Trust Co. v.

Neither Azure nor any other employee of Theta II is mentioned explicitly in the Purchase Agreement;  there are no meaningful categorical references;  the critical provision in the contract, see supra note 11, omits any mention of agents and employees;  and we can find no principled basis for including Azure by necessary implication (especially since the contract contains an integration clause).  These facts strongly militate against conferring third-party beneficiary status upon a corporate officer with respect to arbitration rights.  See Shaffer v.

See Mowbray, 795 F.2d at 1117.   And, finally, the Purchase Agreement neither calls for any performance by the promisor (McCarthy) that will satisfy some obligation owed by the promisee (Theta II) to the putative third party, nor is it \"so expressed as to give the promisor reason to know that a benefit to a third party is contemplated by the promisee as one of the motivating causes of his making the contract.\"  Tamposi, 406 A.2d at 134.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to polish a star.

Without exception, these cases involve instances in which an allegedly aggrieved party has sought to compel a person or entity thought to be a corporate signatory's alter ego to abide by an arbitration clause.  Typical of the genre is Fisser, a case holding that \"if the parent is bound to the contract, then its marionette [the alleged alter ego] is bound to submit to arbitration.\"  282 F.2d at 234-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confronted with a much different situation.  In this case, the supposed wrongdoer seeks to invoke the alter ego doctrine in order to hide behind the corporate entity, that is, to avail himself of the corporation's right to repair to an arbitral forum and thereby avoid a jury trial.  As appellant is not even arguably an innocent third party disadvantaged by someone else's blurring of the line between a corporation and the person who controls it, but, rather, is himself the one who is claimed to have obscured the line, he cannot be permitted to use the alter ego designation to his own behoof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Although the Purchase Agreement does contain an arbitration clause, it is narrow in scope and does not extend the right to compel arbitration to agents or employees of the corporate signatory.  By like token, the Purchase Agreement does not make manifest an intention to confer third-party beneficiary status on any such agents or employees.  And, finally, appellant cannot rely on plaintiff's alter ego claim to draw an equivalence between himself and his corporate principal for his own benefit.  In sum, there is no contractual or other legal lever by which appellant can force plaintiff to arbitrate the \"individual capacity\" claims that are the subject of the underlying suit.  Because this is so, the district court appropriately refused to grant the relief that appellant requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order appealed from is affirmed and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

It also asserted claims against Azure, C.U.T., and Prophet for tortious interference with contractual relationships.  Jurisdiction was premised on the existence of both federal questions, 28 U.S.C.

For that reason, and for the added reason that appellant, individually, was not a signatory to the Confidentiality Agreement, our analysis revolves around the Purchase Agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although plaintiff originally sued Azure in two capacities (individual and official), plaintiff agreed, following oral argument in this court, to abandon his \"official capacity\" claims against Azure.

As we read these cases, an agent's signature on behalf of a disclosed principal \"is not sufficient \" to bind the agent to arbitrate claims against him personally.  Flink, 856 F.2d at 46 (emphasis supplied).  Lee left this legal rule fully intact.  Lee, unlike Frank, merely involved the by-now routine investment service contract context, a situation where additional factors, including \"the plain language of the arbitration clause,\" showed that claims against the agent appropriately were subject to arbitration.  Lee, 983 F.2d at 887</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Of course, the district court in its discretion could stay litigation of nonarbitrable claims pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding.
