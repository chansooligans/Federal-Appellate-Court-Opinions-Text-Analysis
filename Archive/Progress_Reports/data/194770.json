In this appeal,  we review\n                                   \n\nthe  district  court's denial  of  a  Motion  to Alter  or  Amend\n\nJudgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).  This\n\nis  a  run  of  the mill  political  discrimination  case brought\n\nagainst appellants,  Municipality  of Luquillo,  Puerto Rico  and\n\nseveral officials of the Municipality, under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for\n\nviolation of appellees'  First Amendment rights under  the United\n\nStates   Constitution.    The  jury  found  that  the  appellants\n\ndiscriminated against appellees, thirty-eight former employees of\n\nthe  Municipality, and awarded  damages in favor  of twenty-seven\n\nappellees.  Appellants request that we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict  court entirely because the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the  jury's verdict that  appellants terminated appellees\n\nbecause   of  their   political   affiliation.     Alternatively,\n\nappellants pray that we reduce the damage awards because they are\n\nallegedly  excessive.   Plaintiff-appellees,  in a  cross-appeal,\n\nrequest that they be reinstated in their employment.\n\n                                I\n                                 \n\n          Normally, to challenge the sufficiency of  the evidence\n\non appeal, a  party must move for a directed verdict at the close\n\nof  all the  evidence  and follow  it by  a  motion for  judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the  verdict.

The moving party  may appeal only\n\nfrom  the grounds  stated in  the  motion.   Id.; Pstragowski  v.\n                                                             \n\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 553 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1977).  Since\n                          \n\nappellants  failed to move  for a  directed verdict  and judgment\n\nn.o.v., we may  not consider this ground  of appeal.

R. Civ.  P. 59(a), alleging that the verdict  is against the\n\nweight of  the evidence.   Wells Real  Estate, 850  F.2d at  810.\n                                             \n\n\"[A] motion for  a new trial must  be made in the  first instance\n\nbefore the  trial  court, particularly  where the  weight of  the\n\nevidence is at issue.\"  Id., 850 F.2d at 811 (citing 6A James WM.\n                           \n\nMoore, Moore's Federal  Practice    59.15[3], at  326-27 (2d  ed.\n                                \n\n1987)).  Failure to move for a new trial also waives the issue on\n\nappeal.  Id. \n            \n\n          In this  case, appellants once again failed  to make an\n\nappropriate motion  for a  new trial  before the  district court.\n\nInstead, they moved under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e) to set aside  or\n\namend  the verdict.1   The  purpose of  the motion,  however, was\n\n                    \n\n1  Courts have interpreted Rule 59(e) to allow a motion to vacate\na judgment entirely, rather than  just alter it.  See  11 Charles\n                                                     \nA. Wright  &amp; Arthur R.  Miller, Federal Practice and  Procedure  \n                                                               \n817 at 111  n.31, Supp. at 39 n.31 (1973 &amp;  Supp. 1992) and cases\ncited therein.  These courts, however, considered whether  a Rule\n59(e)  motion  was   functionally  equivalent  to  a   motion  to\nreconsider under Rule 60, pursuant  to which a district court may\nvacate a judgment for certain  specified errors.  See, e.g., A.D.\n                                                                 \nWeiss Lithograph Co. v. Illinois Adhesive Products  Co., 705 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n                               -4-\n\nindisputably to  challenge the verdict  as against the  weight of\n\nthe evidence.  While we  do not condone lax, self-styled motions,\n\nor disregard of the Rules, our examination of the character  of a\n\nmotion is functional:  \"nomenclature  should not be exalted  over\n\nsubstance.\"  Echevarr a-Gonz lez v. Gonz lez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24,\n                                                   \n\n26 (1st Cir.  1988) (quoting Lyell Theatre Corp.  v. Loews Corp.,\n                                                                \n\n682 F.2d 37, 41  (2d Cir. 1982)).   We therefore cannot  conclude\n\nthat appellants  failed to  raise the  issue before  the district\n\ncourt.\n\n          The  district   court  apparently  did  not   pay  much\n\nattention to  the rule under  which the motion was  filed, or the\n\ncaption  that  titled  appellants' plea.    The  magistrate judge\n\naddressed   the   sufficiency   argument  directly   and   denied\n\nappellants'  motion because he believed that \"[t]he jury received\n\nabundant  testimonial and  documentary  evidence  with  which  to\n\nsupport  their conclusion  of political  discrimination.\"   Rosa-\n                                                                 \n\nVel zquez v. Figueroa-G mez,  No. 90-1192, slip op. at  1 (D.P.R.\n                           \n\nApr. 15, 1992).   In  addition, appellees did  not object to  the\n\nstyling of  the motion and  seemed to assume that  sufficiency of\n\nthe  evidence could  be assailed  in a  motion under  Rule 59(e).\n\nThus,  while  the district  court  ought  to  have  reformed  the\n\nchallenge  as  one  pursuant  to  Rule  59(a)   earlier  in  this\n\nproceeding, we will treat the motion as one for a new trial.\n\n                    \n\n249, 250 (7th Cir. 1983); Huff v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 675\n                                                            \nF.2d  119,  122 (6th  Cir.  1982).   We  have found  no authority\nsupporting the proposition that a  motion under Rule 59(e) may be\nused  to reevaluate  the weight  of the  evidence after  a jury's\nverdict.\n\n                               -5-\n\n          The decision  to grant a  new trial is  squarely within\n\nthe trial court's discretion.  Allied Chemical Corp.  v. Daiflon,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 449 U.S. 33, 36 (1980).   \"Only an abuse of discretion will\n    \n\ntrigger reversal  of a denial of a motion  for new trial.\"  Wells\n                                                                 \n\nReal Estate, 850 F.2d  at 811; see also Conway v.  Electro Switch\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 825 F.2d 593, 598 (1st Cir.  1987).  Such deference to the\n     \n\ntrial court  is particularly  appropriate in cases  in which  the\n\njury's  verdict  is  challenged  as against  the  weight  of  the\n\nevidence because  \"a jury's verdict  on the facts should  only be\n\noverturned in  the most  compelling circumstances.\"   Wells  Real\n                                                                 \n\nEstate, 850 F.2d  at 811; Keeler v.

A  trial judge may not upset\n\nthe jury's  verdict merely because  he or she might  have decided\n\nthe case differently.  On the contrary, a trial judge may grant a\n\nnew trial only  if she \"believes that the  outcome is against the\n\nclear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will\n\nresult in a miscarriage of justice.\"  Conway, 825 F.2d at 598-99;\n                                            \n\nsee  also Coffran v.

We assume, and we do\n                   \n\nnot review  for, sufficiency of  the evidence.  Valm  v. Hercules\n                                                                 \n\nFish Products, Inc., 701 F.2d 235 (1st Cir. 1983).\n                   \n\n          We  thus review the  evidence to determine  whether the\n\ndistrict court abused  its discretion.  The evidence  showed that\n\nall the plaintiffs  were members of the  Popular Democratic Party\n\n                               -6-\n\n(\"PDP\"); that all defendants were  members of the New Progressive\n\nParty  (\"NPP\");  that  many of  the  plaintiffs  were politically\n\nactive for the PDP during the 1988 campaign which brought the NPP\n\nto  power;  that  defendants knew  of  the  plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliation   prior  to   termination;   that  plaintiffs'   work\n\nresponsibilities were altered with the change in  administration;\n\nand that plaintiffs'  positions in the Municipal  government were\n\nfilled with  members of  the NPP after  termination.   Given this\n\nevidence, the  district court  did  not abuse  its discretion  in\n\nfinding the evidence sufficient to support the jury's verdict and\n\ndenying appellants' motion.\n\n                                II\n                                  \n\n          Appellants' second argument  fails for similar reasons.\n\nAppellants urge  that if the  evidence is deemed  sufficient, the\n\ndamage  awards  be  reduced  because  they are  excessive.    The\n\nstandard of review of damage  awards places an enormous burden on\n\nthe party challenging the award.  To begin with, the evidence  is\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Betancourt  v. J.C.

In  addition, it is  exceedingly \"difficult  on the\n\nbasis of  an  algid  appellate record  to  quantify  damages  for\n\nintangible losses.\"  Ruiz v. Gonz lez-Caraballo, 929  F.2d 31, 34\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.  1991).  Indeed, \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money\n\ndamages  -- especially  in cases  which  involve few  significant\n\nitems of  measurable  economic loss  --  is a  matter  peculiarly\n\nwithin a jury's ken.\"  Wagenmann v.

Therefore, unless  we can  say  that the  award is\n\n\"'grossly excessive,'  'inordinate,' 'shocking to  the conscience\n\nof  the court,' or 'so high that it  would be a denial of justice\n\nto permit  it to stand,'\"  Segal v.

As\n                        \n\nreinstatement is an  equitable remedy, we have  stressed that its\n\nflexible  application  \"seems  particularly  desirable  in  cases\n\ninvolving  important private rights and public institutions\" such\n\nas those involving political  discrimination.  Rosario-Torres  v.\n                                                             \n\nHern ndez-Col n, 889 F.2d  314, 320-21 (1st Cir. 1989).   We have\n               \n\nrejected the notion that  finding a violation of  first amendment\n\nrights leads a fortiori to reinstatement, and recognized that the\n                       \n\n                    \n\n2  The jury awarded sums ranging between $14,200 and $33,500.\n\n                               -8-\n\napplication  of the  remedy  lies  within  the  district  court's\n\ndiscretion.  Id. at 321-22.  The court must apply that discretion\n                \n\non a case by case  basis with a keen eye  to the many factors  in\n\nthe balance.\n\n          The trial court's discretion is not unbounded, however.\n\nIn  fact, we  have cautioned  that  the incidental  burdens on  a\n\npublic  employer accompanying reinstatement -- i.e., \"tension (or\n\neven  hostility) between parties  when forcibly reunited\"  -- are\n\n\"usually  insufficient, without more,  to tip the  scales against\n\nreinstatement  when first  amendment  rights are  at  stake in  a\n\nsection  1983 action.\"  Id. at  322 (citing Banks v. Burkich, 788\n                                                            \n\nF.2d   1161,   1165   (6th  Cir.   1986)).      Thus,  \"equitable\n\nconsiderations different in  kind or degree from  those regularly\n\naccompanying reinstatement must be present if reinstatement is to\n\nbe withheld from  the victim  of a  first amendment  infraction.\"\n\nRosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 323.  \n              \n\n          In  the past,  we have  indicated a  number of  special\n\nconsiderations that influence the district court determination in\n\nspecific  cases, including:   (1)  the strength  of the  evidence\n\nproving the first amendment violation; (2) whether the discharged\n\nemployee has found comparable work; (3) the absence of a property\n\nright in the position because the employee was hired in violation\n\nof local law; and (4)  the ineligibility of the employee  for the\n\nposition,  due to  failure  to  meet established  qualifications,\n\nwhich would permit  immediate discharge for no reason  or for any\n\npermissible reason.   See Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte,  925 F.2d 10,\n                                                  \n\n                               -9-\n\n13-14 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 112 S.

Although   ineligibility  for\n      \n\nappointment \"neither suspend[s] their  first amendment rights nor\n\nundercut[s]  their  entitlement  to  legal relief  under  section\n\n1983,\"  it is  a  factor  weighing  against  reinstatement  if  a\n\nreappointee would be immediately discharged.  Hiraldo-Cancel, 925\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 14.  This list does not canvass all the  relevant factors\n\nbut rather  highlights several  that are particularly  important.\n\nWith these principles in mind,  we review the choice of equitable\n\nremedies for abuse of discretion while recognizing that the trial\n\ncourt  views the evidence from a  better vantage point than we do\n\non the appellate record.  Id.\n                             \n\n          In  this case the  trial court denied  reinstatement to\n\nall prevailing  plaintiffs.   The scant  evidence supporting  the\n\nfirst amendment claims, the amount  of the damage awards, and the\n\nfact  that these employees  were hired illegally  in violation of\n\nPuerto Rico's  personnel laws  provided sufficient  justification\n\nfor  denying  reinstatement.    We  readily  find  no  abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                                IV\n                                  \n\n          In  conclusion, we affirm  the trial court's  denial of\n                                   \n\nthe Rule 59(e) motion and plaintiffs' request for reinstatement.\n\n                               -10-\n",

The  jury  found  that  the  appellants\n\ndiscriminated against appellees, thirty-eight former employees of\n\nthe  Municipality, and awarded  damages in favor  of twenty-seven\n\nappellees.  Appellants request that we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict  court entirely because the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the  jury's verdict that  appellants terminated appellees\n\nbecause   of  their   political   affiliation.     Alternatively,\n\nappellants pray that we reduce the damage awards because they are\n\nallegedly  excessive.

The scant  evidence supporting  the\n\nfirst amendment claims, the amount  of the damage awards, and the\n\nfact  that these employees  were hired illegally  in violation of\n\nPuerto Rico's  personnel laws  provided sufficient  justification\n\nfor  denying  reinstatement.
