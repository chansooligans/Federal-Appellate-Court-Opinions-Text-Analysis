I.\n\n                      Uncontested Facts                                  Uncontested Facts                                                   \n\n          A statement of the uncontested facts leading to the\n\norder compels the conclusion  that there is no merit  to this\n\nappeal.   On  November  22, 1991,  plaintiff-appellee,  Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, N.A., filed a complaint against Villa Marina.\n\nThe complaint sought foreclosure of Chase's mortgage on Villa\n\nMarina property and the collection of monies allegedly due it\n\nfrom Villa Marina.   Chase alleged, as one of the grounds for\n\nforeclosure,  that Villa  Marina  failed to  timely make  the\n\nmonthly mortgage  payments due on  October 1 and  November 1,\n\n1991.  Chase  also requested the  appointment of a  receiver;\n\nthis request was referred to a magistrate-judge.\n\n          Villa Marina filed an opposition to the appointment\n\nof a receiver on December 27, 1991.  On January  10, 1992, it\n\nfiled an answer and counterclaim.  In its answer Villa Marina\n\nstated:\n\n                             -4-\n\n          . .  . it  is admitted that  VILLA MARINA\n          owes CHASE the principal sum and interest\n          therein pleaded, minus  the amounts  that\n          VILLA  MARINA claims against CHASE in the\n          counterclaim  and  the  amounts CHASE  is\n          retaining in its escrow account.\n\nIn  its answer  and  counterclaim, Villa  Marina alleged  bad\n\nfaith termination of the mortgage, breach  of Chase's duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing by creating a fictitious default,\n\nand filing  the foreclosure action  in breach of  Chase's own\n\ninternal manual,  rules, regulations,  and practices.   Villa\n\nMarina estimated its damages as one million dollars.\n\n          On February  10, 1992, Chase moved  for judgment on\n\nthe  pleadings  pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 12(c)  and for\n\ndismissal  of  Villa  Marina's  counterclaim.   Villa  Marina\n\nobjected to these motions.    A hearing  was held before  the\n\nmagistrate-judge  on  March 5,  1992,  which encompassed  all\n\npending matters.  On  March 12, the magistrate-judge issued a\n\nreport and  recommended to the  district court that  it grant\n\nChase's motions  for judgment on the  pleadings and dismissal\n\nof the  counterclaim.  On  the same day  the magistrate-judge\n\nalso issued  an order appointing  a receiver.   Villa  Marina\n\npromptly filed  an emergency  petition for writ  of mandamus,\n\npetition for a stay of the orders, and a motion to vacate the\n\nappointment of the receiver.\n\n          By  order dated May 4,  1992, issued on  May 5, the\n\ndistrict court vacated the magistrate-judge's  appointment of\n\na  receiver because this action \"was beyond both the scope of\n\n                             -5-\n\nour referral and  the scope  of his statutory  powers.\"   The\n\ndistrict court then considered  the matter de novo.   It held                                                              \n\nthat \"Chase has failed to meet the threshold requirements for\n\ngranting  the  appointment  of  a receiver  as  an  equitable\n\nremedy.\"  On May 18,  1992, the district judge issued  a six-\n\npage   order   in  which   she   reviewed   the  report   and\n\nrecommendations  of  the  magistrate.    The  district  court\n\ndeclined   to  follow   the  magistrate-judge's   report  and\n\nrecommendations.   It denied Chase's motions  for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings and dismissal of the counterclaim.\n\n          On July  1, 1992,  the district judge,  sua sponte,                                                                        \n\nissued the order which is the basis of this appeal.  Prior to\n\nthat part of  the order  directing Villa Marina  to make  its\n\nmonthly  mortgage payments  into  court,  the district  judge\n\nstated:\n\n               A  review  of our  order  entered on\n          May 18,  1992  reveals   that  the   last\n          paragraph   was  inadvertently   omitted.\n          Accordingly,  the May  18, 1992  order is\n          amended to add the following:  (Defendant\n          ordered to make monthly mortgage payments\n          into court).\n\n          On  July 16, 1992,  Villa Marina moved  to amend or\n\nalter the  district court order  of May 18.   The motion  was\n\ndenied on  August 6, 1992, and  entered on August 11.   Villa\n\nMarina  appealed the July 1  order of the  district court and\n\nthe court's  denial of its motion to amend or alter the order\n\nof May 18.   Recognizing that  there might be  a question  of\n\n                             -6-\n\nappealability  of  these  orders,  Villa Marina  also  sought\n\nappellate review by filing a petition for writ of mandamus.1\n\n                             II.                                         II.\n\n                           Analysis                                       Analysis                                               \n\n          The  crux of  Villa Marina's  argument is  that the\n\ndistrict court lacked authority  to issue the order requiring\n\nthe deposit  of the mortgage payments with the court.  In its\n\nbrief, Villa Marina asserts that it \"is at a loss to find the\n\njurisdictional basis  for the  order\" [Appellant's  Brief, p.\n\n11], because  there is no  specific provision in  the federal\n\nrules  expressly  authorizing its  issuance  and  because the\n\ncourt  acted  without  a  motion pending.    This  contention\n\nignores  the inherent  power possessed  by a  district court,\n\n\"not governed by  rule or statute,  to manage the  litigation\n\nbefore  it.\"  Zebrowski v. Hanna, 973 F.2d 1001, 1003-04 (1st                                            \n\nCir.  1992).    \"[T]he  rules   of  civil  procedure  do  not\n\ncompletely describe and limit the power of district courts  .\n\n. .  .\"  HMG Property  Investors v.

The  May 18  order makes it  unmistakably\n\nclear  that the  issues in  controversy between  the parties,\n\nincluding those  raised in Villa  Marina's counterclaim, will\n\nbe tried on the merits.   In light of Villa Marina's explicit\n\nadmission in its answer that \"it owes Chase the principal sum\n\nand  interest  therein pleaded,\"  an  order  directing it  to\n\ndeposit  the  monthly  mortgage payments  into  an  interest-\n\nbearing  court  account  as  they  become  due  would not  be\n\nunusual; in fact, it would be routine.  We hold that the July\n\n1  amendment was  wholly  within the  inherent administrative\n\npowers  of the district court and did not constitute an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n          Even if,  for purposes  of this case,  we view  the\n\norder as  a preliminary  injunction,2 as Villa  Marina urges,\n\n                                                    \n\n2 We need not consider whether the district court's order is,\nindeed, an  appealable injunction, and we  express no opinion\non that matter.  Because the case is straightforward, and the\nparty in  whose favor the jurisdictional  issue would operate\nis  entitled  to prevail  on the  merits,  we elect  to forgo\nunnecessary  work and  to  bypass the  question of  appellate\njurisdiction.  See,  e.g., Secretary of  the Navy v.  Avrech,                                                                        \n\n                             -9-\n\nthere is  no basis for overturning  it.  Indeed, we  are at a\n\nloss  to  understand  why  Villa Marina  opposes  the  order.\n\nContrary to Villa Marina's assertion,  it is not a \"windfall\"\n\nto Chase.  The  payments do not go to Chase; they  go into an\n\ninterest-bearing court account.  Until the case is decided on\n\nthe merits, neither Chase nor Villa Marina can use the money.\n\nAnd, if  there had  been no  attempted foreclosure by  Chase,\n\nwrongful  or  justified, Villa  Marina  would  be making  the\n\nmonthly mortgage payments to Chase.  Indeed, Villa Marina, in\n\nits  motion  to amend  or  alter the  appealed  order, stated\n\nexplicitly:\n\n          Villa Marina nevertheless  is willing  to\n          post the funds directly to Chase if Chase                                                         \n          reinstates the mortgage and  Villa Marina\n          is allowed to  pursue its  counterclaims.\n          (footnotes not now pertinent)\n\nAs  the case  now  stands, the  mortgage continues  in effect\n\npending a  hearing on the merits  including the counterclaim.\n\nVilla Marina has received  all it requested.  The order  is a\n\nparadigm  case of preserving the  status quo with  no harm to                                                        \n\neither party pending a hearing on the merits.\n\n          Because  Villa  Marina  has  advanced  no plausible\n\nreason  for this appeal, we find it frivolous and award costs\n\nand attorney fees for  this appeal to appellee Chase.

I.\n\n                      Uncontested Facts                                  Uncontested Facts                                                   \n\n          A statement of the uncontested facts leading to the\n\norder compels the conclusion  that there is no merit  to this\n\nappeal.   On  November  22, 1991,  plaintiff-appellee,  Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, N.A., filed a complaint against Villa Marina.\n\nThe complaint sought foreclosure of Chase's mortgage on Villa\n\nMarina property and the collection of monies allegedly due it\n\nfrom Villa Marina.   Chase alleged, as one of the grounds for\n\nforeclosure,  that Villa  Marina  failed to  timely make  the\n\nmonthly mortgage  payments due on  October 1 and  November 1,\n\n1991.  Chase  also requested the  appointment of a  receiver;\n\nthis request was referred to a magistrate-judge.\n\n          Villa Marina filed an opposition to the appointment\n\nof a receiver on December 27, 1991.  On January  10, 1992, it\n\nfiled an answer and counterclaim.  In its answer Villa Marina\n\nstated:\n\n                             -4-\n\n          . .  . it  is admitted that  VILLA MARINA\n          owes CHASE the principal sum and interest\n          therein pleaded, minus  the amounts  that\n          VILLA  MARINA claims against CHASE in the\n          counterclaim  and  the  amounts CHASE  is\n          retaining in its escrow account.\n\nIn  its answer  and  counterclaim, Villa  Marina alleged  bad\n\nfaith termination of the mortgage, breach  of Chase's duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing by creating a fictitious default,\n\nand filing  the foreclosure action  in breach of  Chase's own\n\ninternal manual,  rules, regulations,  and practices.   Villa\n\nMarina estimated its damages as one million dollars.\n\n          On February  10, 1992, Chase moved  for judgment on\n\nthe  pleadings  pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 12(c)  and for\n\ndismissal  of  Villa  Marina's  counterclaim.   Villa  Marina\n\nobjected to these motions.    A hearing  was held before  the\n\nmagistrate-judge  on  March 5,  1992,  which encompassed  all\n\npending matters.  On  March 12, the magistrate-judge issued a\n\nreport and  recommended to the  district court that  it grant\n\nChase's motions  for judgment on the  pleadings and dismissal\n\nof the  counterclaim.  On  the same day  the magistrate-judge\n\nalso issued  an order appointing  a receiver.   Villa  Marina\n\npromptly filed  an emergency  petition for writ  of mandamus,\n\npetition for a stay of the orders, and a motion to vacate the\n\nappointment of the receiver.\n\n          By  order dated May 4,  1992, issued on  May 5, the\n\ndistrict court vacated the magistrate-judge's  appointment of\n\na  receiver because this action \"was beyond both the scope of\n\n                             -5-\n\nour referral and  the scope  of his statutory  powers.\"   The\n\ndistrict court then considered  the matter de novo.   It held                                                              \n\nthat \"Chase has failed to meet the threshold requirements for\n\ngranting  the  appointment  of  a receiver  as  an  equitable\n\nremedy.\"  On May 18,  1992, the district judge issued  a six-\n\npage   order   in  which   she   reviewed   the  report   and\n\nrecommendations  of  the  magistrate.    The  district  court\n\ndeclined   to  follow   the  magistrate-judge's   report  and\n\nrecommendations.   It denied Chase's motions  for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings and dismissal of the counterclaim.\n\n          On July  1, 1992,  the district judge,  sua sponte,                                                                        \n\nissued the order which is the basis of this appeal.  Prior to\n\nthat part of  the order  directing Villa Marina  to make  its\n\nmonthly  mortgage payments  into  court,  the district  judge\n\nstated:\n\n               A  review  of our  order  entered on\n          May 18,  1992  reveals   that  the   last\n          paragraph   was  inadvertently   omitted.\n          Accordingly,  the May  18, 1992  order is\n          amended to add the following:  (Defendant\n          ordered to make monthly mortgage payments\n          into court).\n\n          On  July 16, 1992,  Villa Marina moved  to amend or\n\nalter the  district court order  of May 18.   The motion  was\n\ndenied on  August 6, 1992, and  entered on August 11.   Villa\n\nMarina  appealed the July 1  order of the  district court and\n\nthe court's  denial of its motion to amend or alter the order\n\nof May 18.   Recognizing that  there might be  a question  of\n\n                             -6-\n\nappealability  of  these  orders,  Villa Marina  also  sought\n\nappellate review by filing a petition for writ of mandamus.1\n\n                             II.                                         II.\n\n                           Analysis                                       Analysis                                               \n\n          The  crux of  Villa Marina's  argument is  that the\n\ndistrict court lacked authority  to issue the order requiring\n\nthe deposit  of the mortgage payments with the court.  In its\n\nbrief, Villa Marina asserts that it \"is at a loss to find the\n\njurisdictional basis  for the  order\" [Appellant's  Brief, p.\n\n11], because  there is no  specific provision in  the federal\n\nrules  expressly  authorizing its  issuance  and  because the\n\ncourt  acted  without  a  motion pending.    This  contention\n\nignores  the inherent  power possessed  by a  district court,\n\n\"not governed by  rule or statute,  to manage the  litigation\n\nbefore  it.\"  Zebrowski v.

The  May 18  order makes it  unmistakably\n\nclear  that the  issues in  controversy between  the parties,\n\nincluding those  raised in Villa  Marina's counterclaim, will\n\nbe tried on the merits.   In light of Villa Marina's explicit\n\nadmission in its answer that \"it owes Chase the principal sum\n\nand  interest  therein pleaded,\"  an  order  directing it  to\n\ndeposit  the  monthly  mortgage payments  into  an  interest-\n\nbearing  court  account  as  they  become  due  would not  be\n\nunusual; in fact, it would be routine.  We hold that the July\n\n1  amendment was  wholly  within the  inherent administrative\n\npowers  of the district court and did not constitute an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n          Even if,  for purposes  of this case,  we view  the\n\norder as  a preliminary  injunction,2 as Villa  Marina urges,\n\n                                                    \n\n2 We need not consider whether the district court's order is,\nindeed, an  appealable injunction, and we  express no opinion\non that matter.  Because the case is straightforward, and the\nparty in  whose favor the jurisdictional  issue would operate\nis  entitled  to prevail  on the  merits,  we elect  to forgo\nunnecessary  work and  to  bypass the  question of  appellate\njurisdiction.  See,  e.g., Secretary of  the Navy v.  Avrech,                                                                        \n\n                             -9-\n\nthere is  no basis for overturning  it.  Indeed, we  are at a\n\nloss  to  understand  why  Villa Marina  opposes  the  order.\n\nContrary to Villa Marina's assertion,  it is not a \"windfall\"\n\nto Chase.  The  payments do not go to Chase; they  go into an\n\ninterest-bearing court account.  Until the case is decided on\n\nthe merits, neither Chase nor Villa Marina can use the money.\n\nAnd, if  there had  been no  attempted foreclosure by  Chase,\n\nwrongful  or  justified, Villa  Marina  would  be making  the\n\nmonthly mortgage payments to Chase.  Indeed, Villa Marina, in\n\nits  motion  to amend  or  alter the  appealed  order, stated\n\nexplicitly:\n\n          Villa Marina nevertheless  is willing  to\n          post the funds directly to Chase if Chase                                                         \n          reinstates the mortgage and  Villa Marina\n          is allowed to  pursue its  counterclaims.\n          (footnotes not now pertinent)\n\nAs  the case  now  stands, the  mortgage continues  in effect\n\npending a  hearing on the merits  including the counterclaim.\n\nVilla Marina has received  all it requested.  The order  is a\n\nparadigm  case of preserving the  status quo with  no harm to                                                        \n\neither party pending a hearing on the merits.\n\n          Because  Villa  Marina  has  advanced  no plausible\n\nreason  for this appeal, we find it frivolous and award costs\n\nand attorney fees for  this appeal to appellee Chase.
