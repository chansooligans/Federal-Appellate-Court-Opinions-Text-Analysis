The  district court  ruled that\n\npetitioner  failed to  satisfy  the \"cause\"  and  \"prejudice\"\n\nrequirement  which  must  be met  before  federal  courts can\n\ncollaterally  review  the  merits  of procedurally  defaulted\n\nconstitutional claims.  Because petitioner has failed to show\n\n\"cause\" for his procedural default, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          We  recite the facts pertinent to the issues raised\n\non  this appeal.1   Petitioner was  tried in  a Massachusetts\n\nstate  court, along with  his co-defendant Patrick  Tracy, on\n\ncharges of armed robbery, carrying a firearm, and  receipt of\n\nstolen property.   The  jury found  petitioner guilty of  the\n\nfirst two offenses but acquitted him of the third.2\n\n          During the  trial  the  Commonwealth  offered  into\n\nevidence a \"booking slip\" that had been completed by a police\n\nofficer  shortly after petitioner's arrest.  The booking slip\n\ncontained biographical information such as petitioner's  age,\n\n                    \n\n1.  A  full recitation  of  the  facts can  be  found in  the\nopinion  of the Massachusetts Appeals Court.  Commonwealth v.\n                                                          \nTracy, 539 N.E.2d  1043 (Mass. App. Ct.  1989), review denied\n                                                             \nsub nom., Commonwealth v. Magee, 542 N.E.2d 602 (Mass. 1989).\n                               \n\n2.  Tracy, a Vietnam  veteran, was found not guilty  of armed\nrobbery by  reason of  insanity stemming from  post-traumatic\nstress  disorder.   Tracy,  539  N.E.2d  at  1044.   He  was,\n                         \nhowever, convicted of the two other charges.  Id.\n                                                 \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nheight and weight.  The lines directly below this information\n\nwere reserved for petitioner's offense.  Petitioner's offense\n\nwas  written in large  block letters  as \"C.  265    17 ARMED\n\nROBBERY  WITH A  DANGEROUS WEAPON.\"   Just  after this  entry\n\nappears  a  second,  smaller  notation:   \"2  c.  265     18B\n\ncommitting an offense while using a firearm (2nd offense).\" \n                                                \n\n          On the same  day that the prosecution  received the\n\nbooking  slip  from  the police,  it  offered  the  slip into\n\nevidence.  Prior to the introduction of the booking slip into\n\nevidence,   defense  counsel  had   a  brief  but  sufficient\n\nopportunity  to  examine it.    Tracy,  539 N.E.2d  at  1047.\n                                     \n\nDefense counsel failed  to notice the \"2nd  offense\" notation\n\nand  proceeded   to  cross-examine  the  police  officer  who\n\ncompleted  the slip about  addresses on  it.   Id.   The only\n                                                  \n\nobjection  raised  by  defense counsel  with  respect  to the\n\nbooking slip was that the  Commonwealth was in violation of a\n\npretrial discovery agreement.\n\n          Three  days  after  the  jury  returned  its guilty\n\nverdict defense  counsel  first  noticed  the  \"2nd  offense\"\n\nnotation, and moved  for a new  trial on the ground  that the\n\nallegedly prejudicial  second offense  notation rendered  his\n\ntrial  fundamentally unfair.    The motion  was  denied.   On\n\ndirect  review the Appeals Court held that because petitioner\n\ndid not seek to exclude  the booking slip from evidence based\n\nupon  the \"2nd  offense\" notation  at the  time the  slip was\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\noffered  by the government, he had procedurally defaulted his\n\nbooking slip objection.  Therefore,  under Massachusetts law,\n\npetitioner's  conviction  would  be  upheld  unless he  could\n\ndemonstrate a \"substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nTracy, 539  N.E.2d at  1046.  Not  finding such,  the Appeals\n     \n\nCourt affirmed petitioner's  conviction, and his  application\n\nfor  review before  the Supreme  Judicial  Court was  denied.\n\nCommonwealth v. Tracy, 539 N.E.2d 1043 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989),\n                     \n\nreview denied sub nom., Commonwealth v. Magee, 542 N.E.2d 602\n                                             \n\n(Mass. 1989).  Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus\n\nfrom the  United States  District Court  for the  District of\n\nMassachusetts.    The  petition was  denied  and  this appeal\n\nensued.\n\n                              II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Federal habeas review is generally precluded when a\n\nstate court reaches its decision  on the basis of an adequate\n\nand independent state  ground.  Coleman  v. Thompson, 111  S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. 2546, 2553-54  (1991); Harris v. Reed, 489  U.S. 255, 262\n                                         \n\n(1989); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 81 (1977).  Where a\n                           \n\nstate  court  decision  rests on  a  petitioner's  failure to\n\ncomply with a  contemporaneous objection rule at  the time of\n\ntrial, this constitutes  an adequate and independent  ground.\n\nWainright, 433 U.S. at 87.\n         \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Under  prevailing  habeas corpus  jurisprudence,  a\n\ndefendant's failure to comply with  a state's contemporaneous\n\nobjection  rule  at  trial  forecloses  judicial scrutiny  on\n\ncollateral  review   if  \"1)   the  state   in  fact   has  a\n\n`contemporaneous objection' rule;  2) the state  enforces and\n\ndoes  not waive the rule; and  3) the defendant fails to show\n\nboth  `cause' for and  `prejudice' from, not  having complied\n\nwith  the rule.\"   McCown  v. Callahan,  726 F.2d  1, 3  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S.  839 (1984); see also Puleio v.\n                                                          \n\nVose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1199  (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  990 (1988); Allen v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 926\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 1991).3\n\n          On  appeal,   petitioner  does  not   dispute  that\n\nMassachusetts has such a contemporaneous objection rule, that\n\nit   enforces  its  rule,  and   does  not  waive  the  rule.\n\nAccordingly, our inquiry  focuses on  whether petitioner  can\n\nshow cause  for his procedural  default as well  as prejudice\n\nfrom the alleged  violation.  Petitioner maintains  that \"the\n\nfactual basis  for the  claim [that the  booking slip  should\n\nhave  been   excluded  because  it  contained  a  prejudicial\n\nnotation]  was not  reasonably  available  to [his]  counsel,\n\n                    \n\n3.  Although  an  exception  to   the  cause  plus  prejudice\nrequirement exists where failure to consider the claim on the\nmerits  would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\nColeman v. Thompson, 111 S.  Ct. at 2564, petitioner does not\n                   \ncontend  that this  exception  applies.   In  any event,  the\nrecord does not support such a claim.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nbecause official misconduct (the prosecutor's introduction of\n\nan irrelevant document as an  exhibit) made it likely that he\n\nwould not notice the prejudicial notation in the document  at\n\nthe time it was offered.\"  Brief for Petitioner at 26.\n\n          In  order  to  establish  cause  for  the  default,\n\npetitioner  must  demonstrate  \"that  some  objective  factor\n\nexternal to  the defense impeded [defense]  counsel's efforts\n\nto  comply with  the  State's procedural  rule.\"   Murray  v.\n                                                         \n\nCarrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).  Two objective impediments\n       \n\nidentified by  the Court  as sufficient  to constitute  cause\n\nunder this standard  are (1) that the factual  or legal basis\n\nfor a claim was not reasonably available to defense  counsel,\n\nor  (2)   that  interference  by  officials  made  compliance\n\nimpracticable.  Id.\n                   \n\n          As a preliminary  matter, the Commonwealth  argues,\n\nand  our  review  of the  record  reveals,  that petitioner's\n\n\"cause\" argument  has  undergone some  alterations since  the\n\ndistrict court denied his petition.  Below, petitioner argued\n\nthat \"cause\"  for  his  procedural  default  existed  because\n\ndefense counsel did  not have sufficient time  to examine the\n\nbooking slip.  Petitioner also argued that his attorney could\n\nnot have been  expected to examine the booking  slip prior to\n\ntrial  since  the  document  was  irrelevant.    There is  no\n\nindication  in  the  record,  however,  that petitioner  ever\n\npresented  the district  court  with its  present contention,\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ni.e., that  the prosecutor knowingly proffered  an irrelevant\n    \n\ndocument in order  to introduce prejudicial information  into\n\nevidence.    It  is  a  settled rule  in  this  circuit  that\n\n\"theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be\n\nsurfaced  for   the  first  time   on  appeal.\"     McCoy  v.\n                                                         \n\nMassachusetts Inst. of  Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1939 (1992).\n                   \n\n          Nonetheless,  assuming  arguendo  that petitioner's\n                                          \n\ncurrent \"cause\" theory is  properly before us, we  are unable\n\nto find any \"external impediments\" to trial counsel's failure\n\nto  timely  notice  the allegedly  prejudicial  entry  on the\n\nbooking slip.  The government's introduction into evidence of\n\nan  irrelevant  document   containing  allegedly  prejudicial\n\ninformation did not obviate defense counsel's  responsibility\n\nnor in  any way impair  his ability to carefully  examine the\n\nentire booking  slip.4   This  is  particularly true  in  the\n\ninstant  case,  where  defense  counsel  extensively   cross-\n\nexamined the  officer who  completed the  booking slip  about\n\nother information  contained on  the slip.   Defense  counsel\n\neven moved for a mistrial on the basis of that information.\n\n          Moreover,  the factual basis for the claim was more\n\nthan reasonably  available to  defense counsel  prior to  the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Petitioner's  focus  on   the  booking  slip's   lack  of\nrelevance is long  past due.  Although the  Appeals Court did\nnote that the booking  slip was not relevant to  any issue at\ntrial, Tracy,  539 N.E.2d  at 1046,  defense counsel  did not\n                                                             \nobject at trial to the slip's admission on this ground.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nadmission of the  booking slip into evidence.   The allegedly\n\nprejudicial notation  was on the  face of the slip  which was\n\ngiven to defense  counsel for examination prior  to admission\n\ninto evidence.  As the  Appeals Court noted, \"counsel may not\n\nhave had much time to look  at the booking slip prior to  its\n\nintroduction,\" but he  \"had ample time  to examine the  slip\"\n\nafter it was offered.  Tracy, 539 N.E.2d at 1047.\n                            \n\n          As    for   petitioner's    implicit   charge    of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, the  Appeals Court  ruled that  the\n\nprosecution  did not violate  any discovery agreement  by not\n\nproducing the booking  slip prior to trial, id.  at 1046, and\n                                               \n\nthat  court assumed that the prosecution did not deliberately\n\nconceal knowledge of the booking  slip or its contents at any\n\ntime.   Id. at  1047 n.7.   Petitioner has  not presented any\n           \n\nevidence  of   misconduct,  but   merely  alleges   that,  by\n\nintroducing  an   irrelevant  document  into   evidence,  the\n\ngovernment  was necessarily motivated  by an illicit purpose.\n\nWe do not find this reasoning persuasive.  \n\n          We   can  perceive   no  external   impediments  to\n\npetitioner's    compliance     with    the     Commonwealth's\n\ncontemporaneous  objection rule.    Petitioner  has tried  to\n\novercome his attorney's oversight by putting the blame on the\n\nprosecutor.   This facade cannot cure petitioner's failure to\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndemonstrate cause for  his procedural default.5   Because the\n\ncause and prejudice  requirement is conjunctive, we  need not\n\nconsider  the latter  element where the  former has  not been\n\nsatisfied.  Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d at 1202.\n                          \n\n          The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.\n                                                Affirmed\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n5.  It  is well  settled  that  \"[a]ttorney  error  short  of\nineffective assistance  of counsel . . .  does not constitute\ncause and will not  excuse a procedural default.\"   McCleskey\n                                                             \nv.

The  jury found  petitioner guilty of  the\n\nfirst two offenses but acquitted him of the third.2\n\n          During the  trial  the  Commonwealth  offered  into\n\nevidence a \"booking slip\" that had been completed by a police\n\nofficer  shortly after petitioner's arrest.  The booking slip\n\ncontained biographical information such as petitioner's  age,\n\n                    \n\n1.  A  full recitation  of  the  facts can  be  found in  the\nopinion  of the Massachusetts Appeals Court.

Prior to the introduction of the booking slip into\n\nevidence,   defense  counsel  had   a  brief  but  sufficient\n\nopportunity  to  examine it.    Tracy,  539 N.E.2d  at  1047.\n                                     \n\nDefense counsel failed  to notice the \"2nd  offense\" notation\n\nand  proceeded   to  cross-examine  the  police  officer  who\n\ncompleted  the slip about  addresses on  it.   Id.   The only\n                                                  \n\nobjection  raised  by  defense counsel  with  respect  to the\n\nbooking slip was that the  Commonwealth was in violation of a\n\npretrial discovery agreement.\n\n          Three  days  after  the  jury  returned  its guilty\n\nverdict defense  counsel  first  noticed  the  \"2nd  offense\"\n\nnotation, and moved  for a new  trial on the ground  that the\n\nallegedly prejudicial  second offense  notation rendered  his\n\ntrial  fundamentally unfair.    The motion  was  denied.   On\n\ndirect  review the Appeals Court held that because petitioner\n\ndid not seek to exclude  the booking slip from evidence based\n\nupon  the \"2nd  offense\" notation  at the  time the  slip was\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\noffered  by the government, he had procedurally defaulted his\n\nbooking slip objection.  Therefore,  under Massachusetts law,\n\npetitioner's  conviction  would  be  upheld  unless he  could\n\ndemonstrate a \"substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nTracy, 539  N.E.2d at  1046.  Not  finding such,  the Appeals\n     \n\nCourt affirmed petitioner's  conviction, and his  application\n\nfor  review before  the Supreme  Judicial  Court was  denied.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Petitioner maintains  that \"the\n\nfactual basis  for the  claim [that the  booking slip  should\n\nhave  been   excluded  because  it  contained  a  prejudicial\n\nnotation]  was not  reasonably  available  to [his]  counsel,\n\n                    \n\n3.  Although  an  exception  to   the  cause  plus  prejudice\nrequirement exists where failure to consider the claim on the\nmerits  would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\nColeman v. Thompson, 111 S.  Ct. at 2564, petitioner does not\n                   \ncontend  that this  exception  applies.

Two objective impediments\n       \n\nidentified by  the Court  as sufficient  to constitute  cause\n\nunder this standard  are (1) that the factual  or legal basis\n\nfor a claim was not reasonably available to defense  counsel,\n\nor  (2)   that  interference  by  officials  made  compliance\n\nimpracticable.  Id.\n                   \n\n          As a preliminary  matter, the Commonwealth  argues,\n\nand  our  review  of the  record  reveals,  that petitioner's\n\n\"cause\" argument  has  undergone some  alterations since  the\n\ndistrict court denied his petition.  Below, petitioner argued\n\nthat \"cause\"  for  his  procedural  default  existed  because\n\ndefense counsel did  not have sufficient time  to examine the\n\nbooking slip.  Petitioner also argued that his attorney could\n\nnot have been  expected to examine the booking  slip prior to\n\ntrial  since  the  document  was  irrelevant.    There is  no\n\nindication  in  the  record,  however,  that petitioner  ever\n\npresented  the district  court  with its  present contention,\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ni.e., that  the prosecutor knowingly proffered  an irrelevant\n    \n\ndocument in order  to introduce prejudicial information  into\n\nevidence.    It  is  a  settled rule  in  this  circuit  that\n\n\"theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be\n\nsurfaced  for   the  first  time   on  appeal.\"     McCoy  v.\n                                                         \n\nMassachusetts Inst. of  Technology, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government's introduction into evidence of\n\nan  irrelevant  document   containing  allegedly  prejudicial\n\ninformation did not obviate defense counsel's  responsibility\n\nnor in  any way impair  his ability to carefully  examine the\n\nentire booking  slip.4   This  is  particularly true  in  the\n\ninstant  case,  where  defense  counsel  extensively   cross-\n\nexamined the  officer who  completed the  booking slip  about\n\nother information  contained on  the slip.   Defense  counsel\n\neven moved for a mistrial on the basis of that information.\n\n          Moreover,  the factual basis for the claim was more\n\nthan reasonably  available to  defense counsel  prior to  the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Petitioner's  focus  on   the  booking  slip's   lack  of\nrelevance is long  past due.  Although the  Appeals Court did\nnote that the booking  slip was not relevant to  any issue at\ntrial, Tracy,  539 N.E.2d  at 1046,  defense counsel  did not\n                                                             \nobject at trial to the slip's admission on this ground.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nadmission of the  booking slip into evidence.   The allegedly\n\nprejudicial notation  was on the  face of the slip  which was\n\ngiven to defense  counsel for examination prior  to admission\n\ninto evidence.  As the  Appeals Court noted, \"counsel may not\n\nhave had much time to look  at the booking slip prior to  its\n\nintroduction,\" but he  \"had ample time  to examine the  slip\"\n\nafter it was offered.  Tracy, 539 N.E.2d at 1047.\n                            \n\n          As    for   petitioner's    implicit   charge    of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, the  Appeals Court  ruled that  the\n\nprosecution  did not violate  any discovery agreement  by not\n\nproducing the booking  slip prior to trial, id.  at 1046, and\n                                               \n\nthat  court assumed that the prosecution did not deliberately\n\nconceal knowledge of the booking  slip or its contents at any\n\ntime.   Id. at  1047 n.7.   Petitioner has  not presented any\n           \n\nevidence  of   misconduct,  but   merely  alleges   that,  by\n\nintroducing  an   irrelevant  document  into   evidence,  the\n\ngovernment  was necessarily motivated  by an illicit purpose.\n\nWe do not find this reasoning persuasive.  \n\n          We   can  perceive   no  external   impediments  to\n\npetitioner's    compliance     with    the     Commonwealth's\n\ncontemporaneous  objection rule.    Petitioner  has tried  to\n\novercome his attorney's oversight by putting the blame on the\n\nprosecutor.   This facade cannot cure petitioner's failure to\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndemonstrate cause for  his procedural default.5   Because the\n\ncause and prejudice  requirement is conjunctive, we  need not\n\nconsider  the latter  element where the  former has  not been\n\nsatisfied.  Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d at 1202.\n                          \n\n          The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.\n                                                Affirmed\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n5.  It  is well  settled  that  \"[a]ttorney  error  short  of\nineffective assistance  of counsel . . .  does not constitute\ncause and will not  excuse a procedural default.\"   McCleskey\n                                                             \nv.
