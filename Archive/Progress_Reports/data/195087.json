Following a  six-day civil\n                               \n\nbench  trial,  the  district  court  ruled  that  the  former\n\nprincipal  owners  of   Consolidated  Auto  Recyclers,   Inc.\n\n(\"CAR\"), defendants  Wayne Bowers, Rodney  Rodrigue, and John\n\nRobichaud (hereinafter  \"the CAR  defendants\"), violated  the\n\nfederal and Maine anti-wiretap statutes when they intercepted\n\nand recorded telephone calls made  by and to plaintiffs,  who\n\nwere  employees   or  former  employees  of   Allied  Capital\n\nCorporation (\"Allied\") and  certain of  its subsidiaries  and\n\naffiliates.1   See 18 U.S.C.    2511(1)(a) and 15  M.R.S.A.  \n                  \n\n710(1).2   The court also  held that counsel retained  by the\n\nCAR defendants, defendants Richard E.

(hereinafter \"the Poulos\n\ndefendants\"), violated 18 U.S.C.   2511(1)(c) and (d)  and 15\n\nM.R.S.A.   710(3)(A) and (B) when they disclosed and used the\n\n                    \n\n1.  For  simplicity's  sake,  the  term  \"Allied\"  should  be\nconstrued  as  encompassing  all   corporate  and  individual\nplaintiffs, including intervenor Ralph A. Dyer.\n\n2.  18  U.S.C.    2511(1)(a)  is a  provision of  the federal\nanti-wiretap statute, found at Title III of the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.    2510-2521.\nIn  conjunction with  other statutory provisions,  it creates\ncriminal   and   civil   liability   for   any   person   who\n\"intentionally   intercepts,  endeavors   to  intercept,   or\nprocures  any  other  person  to  intercept  or  endeavor  to\nintercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\"\n     15 M.R.S.A.    710(1) is a provision of  the Maine anti-\nwiretap  statute,  found  at  15  M.R.S.A.     709-713.    In\nconjunction  with  other  statutory  provisions,  it  creates\ncriminal   and   civil   liability   for   any   person   who\n\"intentionally or knowingly intercepts, attempts to intercept\nor  procures any  other  person to  intercept  or attempt  to\nintercept, any wire or oral communication.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nrecordings of the telephone calls at issue with the requisite\n\nmens rea.3   As a  result, the court enjoined  all defendants\n        \n\n\"from  further using and  disclosing information contained in\n\nthe subject interceptions except to obtain rulings  regarding\n\n                    \n\n3.  18 U.S.C.    2511(c) and  (d), in conjunction  with other\nstatutory provisions, create criminal and civil liability for\nany person who\n\n     (c)  intentionally   discloses,  or   endeavors  to\n     disclose, to any  other person the contents  of any\n     wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or\n     having  reason to  know  that  the information  was\n     obtained through the  interception of a  wire, oral\n     or  electronic communication  in violation  of this\n     subsection; or\n\n     (d) intentionally  uses, or  endeavors to  use, the\n     contents   of   any  wire,   oral,   or  electronic\n     communication,  knowing or  having  reason to  know\n     that  the  information  was  obtained  through  the\n     interception  of  a   wire,  oral,  or   electronic\n     communication in violation of this subsection . . .\n     . \n\n     15 M.R.S.A.    710(3)(A)  and (B),  in conjunction  with\nother  statutory   provisions,  create  criminal   and  civil\nliability for any person who\n\n     A.   Intentionally  or knowingly  discloses  to any\n     person  the  contents  of  any wire  communication,\n     knowing that  the information was  obtained through\n     interception; or\n\n     B.   Intentionally or knowingly uses or attempts to\n     use the contents of any wire or oral communication,\n     knowing that the  information was obtained  through\n     interception.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nadmissibility in  [an] underlying  suit [brought  by the  CAR\n\ndefendants against plaintiffs].\"4  See 18 U.S.C.   2520.5\n                                      \n\n          Each of  the three  sides to  this controversy  has\n\nappealed from  various rulings  made by  the district  court.\n\nBoth the CAR  defendants and the Poulos  defendants challenge\n\nsundry  factual   findings  and   legal  judgments,   arguing\n\nessentially that their  respective actions did not  run afoul\n\nof Title III and the Maine anti-wiretap statute.  Plaintiffs'\n\nprimary  claim  is  that  the  court's  injunction  does  not\n\nsufficiently  remedy  the  harm they  have  suffered  and are\n\ncontinuing to suffer.   After carefully reviewing  the record\n\nand the parties' arguments, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n                    \n\n4.  In the underlying  suit, Bowers v. Allied  Capital Corp.,\n                                                            \nCiv. No. 91-0021-B  (D. Me. filed  January 1991) (Brody,  J.)\n(\"Bowers\"),  which  was  stayed  pending  resolution  of  the\n        \ninstant  case, the  CAR defendants  assert  causes of  action\nunder the Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C.     1961-68, the Securities  Exchange Act\nof  1934, 15  U.S.C.     78a-78kk, and  a host of  common law\ntheories.  Essentially, they contend that Allied entities and\npersonnel brought  about the  demise of  CAR through  certain\nacts  primarily  committed  in  the  summer  of  1990.    The\nparticulars  of the relationship  between CAR and  the Allied\nentities and personnel will be discussed more fully infra.\n                                                         \n\n5.  Inter  alia,   18  U.S.C.      2520   authorizes  persons\n               \nvictimized by violations  of 18 U.S.C.    2511(1)(a),(c), and\n(d) to recover,  by means of a civil  action, (1) appropriate\nequitable  or  declaratory  relief; (2)  actual  or statutory\ndamages; (3) punitive damages; and (4) litigation costs and a\nreasonable attorney's fee. \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The following detailed  recitation is derived  from\n\nthe   factual  findings  made   by  the  district   court  in\n\nconjunction with  Allied's motion for  preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief, see Williams v. Poulos,  801 F. Supp. 867, 868-72 (D.\n                              \n\nMe. 1992) (\"Poulos I\"), and after the conclusion of the bench\n                    \n\ntrial.  See Williams v.  Poulos, Civ. No. 92-0069-B, slip op.\n                               \n\nat 3-10 (D. Me.

CAR  was  founded in  1988  in  order to\n\ndismantle automobiles  and resell used  parts.  By  May 1990,\n\nCAR employed approximately  one hundred and forty  people and\n\noperated throughout New England and in the Atlantic provinces\n\nof  Canada.  Twenty  people worked in  CAR's East Vassalboro,\n\nMaine,   headquarters,   including  Bowers,   Rodrigue,   and\n\nRobichaud,  the  CAR defendants.   These  three owned  95% of\n\nCAR's  stock and  were members  of  CAR's Board  of Directors\n\n(\"the Board\").  In addition, Bowers was CAR's Chief Executive\n\nOfficer (\"CEO\") and Treasurer, while Rodrigue served as CAR's\n\nPresident.\n\n                    \n\n6.  The  order and memorandum  of opinion on  the bench trial\nincorporates by reference  the factual findings set  forth in\nthe  order and  memorandum of  opinion  on the  motion for  a\npreliminary injunction.  See Poulos II, slip op. at 3.\n                                      \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          To  finance its  early growth  and operations,  CAR\n\ndeveloped a banking  relationship with  Casco Northern  Bank.\n\nIn  February 1990, Casco  Northern refused to  increase CAR's\n\nlines of credit.  As a result, CAR found itself in  a serious\n\nfinancial  bind because it  had already spent  the additional\n\nmoney it  expected to  receive.   Accordingly, CAR turned  to\n\nAllied,  a venture capital firm which had previously invested\n\nin it.   Allied  responded with a  large infusion  of capital\n\nthat  raised its  total investment  in  CAR to  approximately\n\n$4,500,000.\n\n          Despite this additional funding, CAR was unable  to\n\nresolve its  financial difficulties.  On May  29, 1990, Casco\n\nNorthern declared  CAR in  default on  its obligations.   Two\n\ndays  later, Allied followed  suit.  On June  28, 1990, in an\n\nattempt to  resolve the  crisis, the  CAR defendants  entered\n\ninto an agreement  with Allied which came to be  known as the\n\n\"Midnight  Agreement.\"   Under its  terms, Ralph A.  Dyer was\n\nmade   CAR's   CEO   and  Chairman   of   the   Board,  three\n\nrepresentatives  of Allied,  plaintiffs  George C.  Williams,\n\nDavid Gladstone, and Frederick  Russell, Jr., became  members\n\nof  the Board,  and  David  Parker became  an  officer.   The\n\nAgreement  also provided that the CAR defendants would remain\n\non the  Board,  that  Bowers  would retain  his  position  as\n\nTreasurer, and that Rodrigue would continue as President. \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Meanwhile,  in May  1990,  the  CAR defendants  had\n\ncommissioned Michael Leighton, who owned Probe  Investigating\n\nService,   Inc.   (\"Probe\"),   to   provide   a  system   for\n\nelectronically  monitoring employee  phone  calls.7   The CAR\n\ndefendants felt that a surveillance system was needed  (1) to\n\nreduce  CAR's telephone  bills,  and  (2)  decrease  employee\n\ntheft.   At  the  time  they installed  the  system, the  CAR\n\ndefendants apparently received impromptu advice from Attorney\n\nNicholas  Lanzilotta that \"monitoring would not be illegal if\n\nnotice was first given to the monitored employees.\"\n\n          After  examining CAR's  telephone system,  Leighton\n\nconcluded that he lacked the skill and expertise to create an\n\nappropriate   monitoring  system.      He  therefore   sought\n\nassistance from Jonathan Broome.  Broome's principal business\n\nwas  repairing consumer electronics; he was not an authorized\n\ntelephone system technician.  Although  Broome considered the\n\nproject to be unusual, Leighton assured him of its legality.\n\n          On  or about June  17, 1990, Broome,  working after\n\nhours along with CAR security officer David Fisher, installed\n\na  custom-designed   monitoring   system8   in   CAR's   East\n\n                    \n\n7.  Leighton and  Probe were also named as defendants in this\naction.   At the close  of trial, the district  court granted\ntheir  oral  motions  for  judgment  as   a  matter  of  law.\nPlaintiffs have not appealed these rulings.\n\n8.  Apparently, there  was no  commercially available  system\nwhich could perform the intercepting and  recording functions\ndesired by the CAR defendants.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nVassalboro  headquarters.   In  its  findings  of  fact,  the\n\ndistrict court described the system as follows:\n\n               The system . . . consisted  of small\n          alligator clips attached  to a microphone\n          cable at  one end and  a \"punch-down\"  at\n          the  other.     The  wires  to   all  the\n          extension  lines  in CAR's  offices  were\n          assembled on the punch-down.  Calls could\n          be intercepted by attaching the alligator\n          clips and microphone wire to a designated\n          extension  line on  the punch-down.   The\n          system could  only monitor  one extension\n          at a time.\n               The  monitoring  system  designed by\n          Broome   also   involved   an   interface\n          connecting the microphone cable to a  VCR\n          and  a video camera.  The VCR allowed the\n          system to  record calls  for up  to eight\n          hours.   The  video  camera recorded  the\n          view meter on the  VCR, allowing a person\n          to  fast forward  the VCR tape  until the\n          meter  indicated  the presence  of  audio\n          information.   The VCR, video  camera and\n          interface  were  mounted  together  on  a\n          plywood  board and  set up  in an  unused\n          bathroom next to  the area containing the\n          punch-down.   Connecting  wires were  run\n          through and over a suspended ceiling.\n\nPoulos II, slip op. at 4-5.\n         \n\n          At some point  in June 1990, Rodrigue  informed the\n\nmanagers at  CAR that all  telephone calls  at CAR's  offices\n\nwould be subject to random monitoring and recording.  He also\n\ninstructed the managers  to inform their subordinates  of the\n\nnew monitoring  policy.   At about  the  same time,  Rodrigue\n\ndirected employees  to record  long distance  phone calls  on\n\nprovided  telephone logs.   The employees were  told that the\n\nlogging  system  was  to  be used  in  conjunction  with  the\n\nmonitoring  system  to  reduce  costs.    On  June  29, 1990,\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nRodrigue  told the new  CEO, Dyer, that  CAR had a  system in\n\nplace  to deter employee  phone abuse by  randomly monitoring\n\nemployee phone calls. \n\n          David Fisher learned how to operate the  monitoring\n\nsystem.  At first, he was instructed by the CAR defendants to\n\nmonitor the extension  lines randomly.   After a short  time,\n\nhowever,  the  CAR   defendants  told  him  which   lines  to\n\nintercept.   Fisher  was further  instructed  to deliver  the\n\ntapes of  recorded conversations  to Wayne  Bowers each  day.\n\nBowers  then   made   cassette  tapes   of  those   telephone\n\nconversations he wished to save.\n\n           On June 21, 1990, Fisher was instructed to monitor\n\nthe telephone  line of  CAR Chief  Financial Officer  Richard\n\nLee,  who   had  been   hired  on   Allied's  recommendation.\n\nApparently, Rodrigue and Bowers doubted Lee's loyalty to CAR.\n\nA  few  weeks  later,  however,  the  monitoring  system  was\n\nattached to the  phone line of Jim Starr,  an accountant from\n\nan outside firm who had been assigned  to audit CAR.  The CAR\n\ndefendants  suspected that  Starr was misusing  the telephone\n\nsystem.\n\n          During  this  same  general   time  period,  Dyer's\n\nrelationship with the CAR defendants, which had been strained\n\nfrom  the beginning, was rapidly deteriorating.   By July 10,\n\n1990,  Rodrigue and Robichaud  were openly feuding  with him.\n\nOn July  12, 1990, Dyer fired Rodrigue  and Robichaud.  About\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\na   week  after  the   firing,  Dyer  obtained   a  temporary\n\nrestraining order barring Rodrigue and Robichaud from the CAR\n\npremises and prohibiting them from conducting any business on\n\nthe company's  behalf.   Meanwhile, on July  17 or  18, 1990,\n\nDyer   began  occupying  Starr's  office  and  using  Starr's\n\ntelephone line.  Between July 18, 1990, and July  25, 1990, a\n\nnumber  of  Dyer's  telephone   calls  were  intercepted  and\n\nrecorded.  The  CAR defendants admit that, by  July 19, 1990,\n\nthey were specifically targeting Dyer's conversations.9\n\n          On  July  21,  1990, the  CAR  defendants  met with\n\nattorneys Richard  E. Poulos, John  S. Campbell, and  Paul F.\n\nZendzian,  the partners of Poulos, Campbell &amp; Zendzian, P.A.,\n\nto discuss possible legal representation in matters involving\n\nCAR, Allied, and  Dyer.10  At that meeting,  the existence of\n\na tape  containing recorded  telephone conversations  between\n\nDyer and Allied  employees and representatives was  disclosed\n\nto the  Poulos defendants.   The  Poulos  defendants made  no\n\ninquiry  into  either how  the tape  was obtained  or whether\n\n                    \n\n9.  Although not mentioned  in the district  court's findings\nof  fact,  the record  reflects that  telephone conversations\ninvolving Brooks Browne, an Allied employee working at CAR in\nlate July 1990,  also were intercepted  and recorded.   These\nconversations  took  place  while  Browne  was  using  Dyer's\ntelephone.\n\n10.  Zendzian was  not named as  a defendant in  this action.\nCampbell,  who was  a defendant  below,  was adjudged  by the\ntrial  court not  to have  violated either  Title III  or the\nMaine anti-wiretap  statute.   Plaintiffs  have not  appealed\nfrom this ruling.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nthere was  employee notice  or consent.   They did,  however,\n\nadvise the CAR defendants to boycott a Board meeting that was\n\nscheduled for  July 23, 1990.   That meeting, which  was held\n\ntelephonically so that the out-of-town Allied employees could\n\nparticipate, was taped by the CAR defendants. \n\n          All    monitoring   and    taping   of    telephone\n\nconversations at CAR's headquarters  was discontinued on July\n\n25, 1990.   On that same date, audio cassettes of some of the\n\nconversations  that  had  been taped  were  delivered  to the\n\nPoulos  defendants, who soon  thereafter agreed  to represent\n\nthe CAR defendants in the Bowers lawsuit.   See supra note 4.\n                                                     \n\nOver the following six weeks, paralegals from the Poulos firm\n\nprepared transcripts of the tapes.\n\n          On July 27,  1990, pursuant to a  certificate filed\n\nby Dyer with the United States Bankruptcy Court, a Chapter 11\n\nbankruptcy  proceeding  was  initiated  on   behalf  of  CAR.\n\nAnthony Swenson was appointed  Chapter 11 trustee for CAR  on\n\nAugust 10,  1990.  On August 14, 1990, Swenson fired Dyer and\n\nrehired Bowers, Rodrigue,  and Robichaud.   Subsequently, the\n\nbankruptcy proceeding was converted to Chapter 7.\n\n          In  early  August  1990,  Poulos  asked  Stuart  W.\n\nTisdale, an  associate attorney in  his office, to  prepare a\n\nmemorandum  concerning  the  legality  of  intercepting  wire\n\ncommunications.   In discussing  the research assignment with\n\nTisdale,  Poulos stated that  Dyer knew  about the  taping in\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nquestion.   After  reading Tisdale's  memorandum, Poulos  and\n\nCampbell were satisfied that at least some of the information\n\nfrom the  tapes might be  admissible as evidence or  would be\n\notherwise useful in the case against Allied.  In the district\n\ncourt's view, however, they did not \"follow through  on their\n\nresearch  on the  issue of  consent and  the legality  of the\n\ninterceptions.\"   Poulos II,  slip op.  at 8.   Nor did  they\n                           \n\n\"make an  effort to determine  directly whether Dyer  and the\n\nother Allied employees  whose conversations were  intercepted\n\nknew of or consented to the  monitoring.\"  Id.  Finally,  the\n                                              \n\nPoulos defendants \"did not consult with bar counsel or advise\n\nany court of the existence and use of the information derived\n\nfrom the telephone conversations.\"  Id.\n                                       \n\n          On  September  3  and  4,  1990,  Poulos  read  the\n\ntranscripts  of most of  the recorded conversations  that had\n\nbeen preserved.  On October  31, 1990, he disclosed  contents\n\nof the  tapes to Daniel  Amory and David Crocker,  counsel to\n\nthe CAR Chapter 11 trustee.   In so doing, Poulos  told Amory\n\nand Crocker  that  the tapes  he  possessed might  have  been\n\ncriminally  obtained.    He  also  asked  them  to  keep  the\n\nexistence and  contents of  the tapes  strictly confidential.\n\nIn November and  December of 1990, Poulos  again reviewed the\n\ntapes.\n\n          In September, October, and early November  of 1990,\n\nthe  Poulos defendants obtained  a large number  of documents\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\npreviously delivered by  Allied to CAR's Chapter  11 trustee.\n\nThe  documents were produced  without any involvement  of the\n\nPoulos defendants and without any connection to the existence\n\nof  the  taped  telephone  conversations.    These  documents\n\nincluded notes,  memoranda,  and  other  written  records  of\n\ntelephone  conversations that had been  taped on July 18, 19,\n\n20, and 23, 1990.\n\n          In  January  1991,  the CAR  defendants  filed  the\n\nBowers lawsuit, seeking  $63,000,000 in damages from  Allied,\n      \n\nDyer, and Leo Madden, a  business associate of Dyer's.  After\n\nthe  complaint  was  filed, all  discovery  was  stayed until\n\nDecember  5, 1991.   During January  1992, shortly  after the\n\ndiscovery stay  was lifted,  Poulos took  the depositions  of\n\nWilliams, Parker,  Dyer, and Madden.   Poulos  used both  the\n\ndiscovery documents pertaining to the taped conversations and\n\nthe  tapes of the  conversations themselves in  preparing for\n\nthe aforementioned depositions.  Following these depositions,\n\nPoulos revealed the  existence of  the tapes  to counsel  for\n\nMadden and  Dyer.  In so doing, he  (1) told counsel that the\n\ntapes  proved that  Madden  and Dyer  had  lied during  their\n\ndepositions,  and  (2)  offered  to  settle  with  them.   No\n\nsettlement was reached  between the parties, and  the present\n\nlawsuit was filed by Allied on April 17, 1992.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                        \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          Insofar    as   the    parties   are    challenging\n\ndeterminations made  by the  district court  prior to  and in\n\nconjunction with  the bench trial, our standard  of review is\n\nfamiliar.

In  other words, we will  give such\n     \n\nfindings effect  unless, after carefully  reading the  record\n\nand according  due deference  to the  trial court's  superior\n\nability  to judge credibility, we form \"`a strong, unyielding\n\nbelief that  a mistake  has been made.'\"   Dedham  Water, 972\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 457 (quoting Cumpiano v.

Statutory Exceptions\n                             \n\n          As  both the CAR  and Poulos defendants  point out,\n\nnot  all aural  acquisitions of  wire,  oral, and  electronic\n\ncommunications are illegal  and give rise to  liability under\n\nTitle  III  and the  Maine  act.    In fact,  these  statutes\n\nspecifically delineate  certain acquisitions that do not give\n                                                        \n\nrise to  such liability.  Defendants argue  that the district\n\ncourt erred in ruling that two of these defined exceptions --\n\nthe  business extension  and consent  exceptions  -- did  not\n\napply.  Our  review, however, persuades  us that the  court's\n\nrulings are supported by the record.\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\n          a.

Section  2510(4)  defines   the  term\n\n\"interception\"  as \"the  aural or  other  acquisition of  the\n\ncontents  of  any  wire,  electronic,  or oral  communication\n\nthrough  the  use  of any  electronic,  mechanical,  or other\n                                                             \n\ndevice.\" (Emphasis supplied).  Section 2510(5), insofar as is\n      \n\nrelevant,  then  defines  \"electronic, mechanical,  or  other\n\ndevice\" in the following manner:\n\n       (5)  \"electronic,  mechanical, or  other  device\"\n     means any device or apparatus  which can be used to\n     intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication\n     other than --\n               \n\n            (a)   any   telephone    or   telegraph\n          instrument, equipment or facility, or any\n          component thereof, (i) . . . furnished by\n          [a] subscriber or  user for connection to\n          the facilities of  [a wire or  electronic\n          communication]  service and  used in  the\n          ordinary course of its business[.]\n\n(Emphasis  supplied).  Thus,  if the monitoring  conducted by\n\nthe  CAR  defendants  had  been  effectuated by  means  of  a\n\n                    \n\n12.  The  business extension exception  is found only  in the\nfederal act.  Thus, we confine our discussion in this section\nof the opinion to federal law.\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\n\"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or\n\nany component  thereof\" which was  both furnished by  CAR for\n\nconnection to the facilities of its communication service and\n\nused  in the  ordinary course  of  its business,  defendants'\n\nactions would  not constitute  an interception  and would  be\n\nbeyond the reach of Title III.\n\n          The  district court  determined  that the  business\n\nextension  exception did  not  apply for  two  reasons:   (1)\n\nbecause  \"the  subject  conversations  were  intercepted  and\n\nrecorded by  a  device configured  by  someone other  than  a\n\nprovider  of  electronic  communication  service\";  and   (2)\n\nbecause \"a  legitimate business purpose did not  exist at the\n\ntime the subject conversations were intercepted.\"  See Poulos\n                                                             \n\nII,  slip op.  at  17.   Perhaps  recognizing  the amount  of\n  \n\ndeference owed to the court's resolution of this paradigmatic\n\nmixed question  of law and  fact, defendants do not  expend a\n\ngreat  amount  of  energy  attacking  the   factual  findings\n\nunderpinning the  court's conclusions.   Instead, they  argue\n\nthat  the  court's  ruling was  infected  by  erroneous legal\n\nreasoning.  More specifically,  defendants assert that,  with\n\nregard to its  first stated reason, the  court misapprehended\n\nthe technical requirements  of the statute, and,  with regard\n\nto its second stated reason, the court misconstrued  the term\n\n\"ordinary course of business.\" \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\n          We agree  with defendants that, in  concluding that\n\nthe business  extension exception  did not  apply, the  court\n\nerred in its reasoning.  Section 2510(5)(a) does not  require\n\nthat the  acquisition device be  configured by a  provider of\n\nelectronic  communication service.  Nor does it direct courts\n\nto conduct  an inquiry  into whether  a \"legitimate  business\n\npurpose\" for monitoring exists at the time  of the challenged\n\naural acquisition.\n\n          Nonetheless,  we   believe  the   district  court's\n\nultimate determination, that the business extension exception\n\ndoes not apply, is sustainable.  Simply put, we are at a loss\n\nto see how the monitoring  system used here, consisting as it\n\ndid of \"alligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one\n\nend\"  and an \"interface connecting [a]  microphone cable to a\n\nVCR and a video camera\" on the other, can be considered to be\n\na \"telephone or telegraph instrument,  equipment or facility,\n\nor a[]  component thereof.\"13   In so  stating, we  note that\n\n                    \n\n13.  In support of its position that the CAR device should be\nso considered,  defendants advance three  arguments that are,\nat best,  unpersuasive.   First, defendants  assert that  the\nrecord evidence demonstrates  that the monitoring  device was\ncomprised  of   standard  electronic  components   which  are\n\"commonly used in  telephone systems.\"  Upon  close scrutiny,\nhowever, it  is clear that this assertion  is premised solely\nupon an  outrageous mischaracterization  of the  testimony of\nJonathan  Broome.    Broome did  not  testify,  as defendants\nsuggest, that the components of the  CAR system \"are commonly\n                                                             \nused in telephone  systems.\"  (Emphasis supplied).   Instead,\n       \nhe  answered the question, \"So, these wires were not uncommon\nparts or  components for use  in various ways with  the [sic]\n                                                  \ntelephone systems,  were they?\" by  responding, \"No.   It was\nall  -- you don't  usually use balanced  shielded audio cable\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nthe  CAR system is  factually remote from  the telephonic and\n\ntelegraphic  equipment  courts  have  recognized  as  falling\n\nwithin the exception  at 18 U.S.C.   2510(5)(a).   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nEpps v.  St. Mary's  Hosp., 802 F.2d  412, 415-16  (11th Cir.\n                          \n\n1986)  (dispatch  console  installed  by  telephone   company\n\nconsidered telephone equipment); Watkins v. L.M. Berry &amp; Co.,\n                                                            \n\n704 F.2d  577, 582-84  (11th Cir.  1983) (standard  extension\n\ntelephone implicitly considered  telephone equipment); Briggs\n                                                             \n\nv. American Air  Filter Co., Inc., 630 F.2d  414, 416-20 (5th\n                                 \n\nCir.  1980) (same); James v. Newspaper Agency Corp., 591 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n579, 581  (10th Cir.  1979) (monitoring  device installed  by\n\n                    \n\nfor  telephone, but  it is quite  acceptable to.\"   (Emphasis\nsupplied).  In other  words, rather than testifying that  the\ncomponents  are  commonly used  in telephone  systems, Broome\n                                  \nstated  that, though  it was  unusual,  the components  could\n                                                             \nacceptably be used with telephone systems.  In our view, such\n                       \ntestimony is not helpful to defendants.\n     Second, defendants claim that certain 1986 amendments to\nthe federal anti-wiretap statute were intended to broaden the\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C.    2510(5)(a) so as to include equipment\nsuch as the CAR monitoring device.  This argument  flagrantly\nmisconstrues  the purpose of  the congressional action.   The\nlegislative   history  makes  it   apparent  that   the  1986\namendments  were  aimed  at   strengthening  the  statute  by\n                                           \nupdating   it    to   reflect   nearly    twenty   years   of\ntelecommunications advances.   See generally S. Rep.  No. 99-\n                                            \n541,  99th   Cong.,  2d   Sess.  1-11,   reprinted  in   1986\n                                                      \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3555-65.  Despite defendants' contrary  urgings,\nthere  is absolutely no  evidence in this  history suggesting\nthat Congress meant to expand the parameters of the  business\nextension exception so  as to embrace almost  all wiretapping\nequipment.\n     Finally,  defendants  seem  to   argue  that  the  First\nCircuit, in Campiti, 611 F.2d at 392, read the \"any telephone\n                   \nor  telegraph  instrument,  equipment  or  facility,  or  any\ncomponent  thereof\" provision out of    2510(5)(a).  We think\nit sufficient to state without elaboration that Campiti, when\n                                                       \nfairly read in context, does no such thing.  \n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\ntelephone company implicitly considered telephone equipment).\n\nIndeed, we  think it  self evident that  the CAR  system, far\n\nfrom being  the type of exempt equipment  contemplated by the\n\nauthors of the business extension exception, is precisely the\n\ntype of  intercepting device  Congress  intended to  regulate\n\nheavily when it enacted Title III.\n\n          We recognize that it is not ordinarily the province\n\nof appellate courts  to make findings of fact  or to resolve,\n\nin the first instance, mixed questions of law and fact.  Yet,\n\nwhere  only  one  resolution  of  a  predominantly  factbound\n\nquestion would, on  a full record, be  sustainable, courts of\n\nappeals can, and often should, decline to remand where  there\n\nhas  been an error committed.  See  Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n463; see also In re Two  Appeals Arising Out of the San  Juan\n                                                             \n\nPlaza  Hotel Fire Litigation, 994  F.2d 956, 968-69 (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1993)  (appellate  courts may  eschew remand  where remanding\n\nwould be  an empty  exercise); Societe  Des Produits  Nestle,\n                                                             \n\nS.A.  v. Casa  Helvetia, Inc.,  982 F.2d  633, 642  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1992)  (where trial court \"supportably `made the key findings\n\nof  fact' but  applied the wrong  rule of  law, the  court of\n\nappeals ha[s]  the power,  in  lieu of  remanding, simply  to\n\nregroup  the findings  `along the  proper matrix'\")  (quoting\n\nUnited States  v. Mora, 821  F.2d 860, 869 (1st  Cir. 1987)).\n                      \n\nHere, given the  trial court's findings regarding  the nature\n\nof the monitoring  device, the only sustainable  ruling would\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nbe  that  the  device  was  not  a  \"telephone  or  telegraph\n\ninstrument, equipment or  facility, or a component  thereof,\"\n\nand  therefore  not  within the  parameters  of  the business\n\nextension  exception.   Accordingly,  we reject  the argument\n\nthat defendants are protected by this exception.14\n\n          b.  The Consent Exception\n                                   \n\n          Both the federal and Maine acts specifically exempt\n\nfrom their prohibitions the  interceptions of telephone calls\n\nwhere one or more of the conversants has consented to  or, in\n\nthe   case  of  the  Maine  act,  previously  authorized  the\n\ninterception.  See  18 U.S.C.   2511(2)(d) and  15 M.R.S.A.  \n                  \n\n709(4)(C).15   As we  have  made clear,  consent under  Title\n\n                    \n\n14.  In  their  brief,  the  CAR  defendants  conclude  their\nargument that the business extension exception applies with a\nvery  short  equitable  argument  that  their   \"good  faith\"\nreliance  on  the  advice of  others,  including  counsel, in\ninstalling  the monitoring  system  should absolve  them from\nliability.   They do  not, however,  adduce any  authority in\nsupport of this novel proposition.   Moreover, in the  course\nof   rebuffing  defendants'   business  extension   exception\nargument,  the district  court  supportably  found  that  the\ninterceptions here at  issue were not effectuated  to further\nthe original purpose of the monitoring system.  Defendants do\nnot,  and cannot, seriously contest this  finding.  Thus, the\nalleged  good faith  of  the  CAR  defendants  in  originally\n                                                             \ninstalling the system is irrelevant.\n                     \n\n15.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C.   2511(2)(d) provides:\n\n       It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a\n     person not acting under color of law to intercept a\n     wire, oral, or electronic communication where . . .\n     one of the  parties to the communication  has given\n     prior consent to such interception . . . .\n\n     Similarly, 15  M.R.S.A.    709(4)(C)  excludes from  the\nreach  of   the  statute  those  interceptors   \"given  prior\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nIII16 need  not  be explicit;  instead,  it can  be  implied.\n\nSee Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904  F.2d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                        \n\nImplied consent is  not, however, constructive consent.   Id.\n                                                             \n\n\"Rather,  implied consent  is  `consent  in  fact'  which  is\n\ninferred `from surrounding circumstances indicating that  the\n\nparty knowingly agreed  to the surveillance.'\"  Id. at 116-17\n                                                   \n\n(quoting United  States v. Amen,  831 F.2d 373, 378  (2d Cir.\n                               \n\n1987),  cert. denied,  108  S.  Ct.  1573  (1988))  (brackets\n                    \n\nomitted) (emphasis supplied).   In light of  the prophylactic\n\npurposes of Title III, implied consent should not be casually\n\ninferred.  See id. at 117. \n                  \n\n          Here,  the record  reflects and the  district court\n\nfound that  Ralph Dyer  was told of  the \"monitoring\"  of CAR\n\nemployee  telephone  calls.17    The  record  is  not  clear,\n\nhowever, as to whether Dyer was informed (1) of the manner --\n\ni.e.,   the   intercepting   and   recording   of   telephone\n\n                    \n\nauthority by the sender or receiver.\"   \n\n16.  Because  the  \"consent\"  standard  under  Title  III  is\ncertainly  no  more  stringent  than  the  \"prior  authority\"\nstandard set forth in 15 M.R.S.A.   709(4)(C), see supra note\n                                                        \n15, and because, as will  be demonstrated below, we rule that\nthe district  court did not  clearly err in finding  that the\nconsent standard had  not been met, we need  only discuss the\nfederal act in this section of the opinion.\n\n17.  Defendants' consent arguments  involve only the  actions\nof Ralph Dyer,  and are not directed at  the district court's\nsummary judgment ruling that the consent exception does apply\nto the conversations involving  Brooks Browne.   Accordingly,\nwe   limit  our  discussion  to  whether  Dyer  consented  to\ninterceptions of his telephone conversations.\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nconversations  -- in which this monitoring was conducted; and\n\n(2) that  he himself would  be subjected to  such monitoring.\n\nThere  was testimony  tending  to  indicate  that he  was  so\n\ninformed,  which the district  judge apparently chose  not to\n\ncredit, and  testimony tending to  indicate that he  was not.\n\nIn our view, the latter testimony, far from being incredible,\n\nwas highly  plausible.18  Thus, there  is no basis  for us to\n\nconclude that  the district  court clearly  erred in  finding\n\nthat Dyer was not told of the manner in which  the monitoring\n\nwas conducted  and that he  himself would be monitored.   Cf.\n                                                             \n\nRodriguez-Morales, 931 F.2d at 982 (district court's  finding\n                 \n\nshould not be disturbed where there are two permissible views\n\nof  the  evidence).    And, without  at  least  this  minimal\n                                              \n\nknowledge on the  part of Dyer, we do not see how his consent\n\nin fact to the monitoring could be inferred from this record.\n\nCf.  Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d  at 117 (implied  consent inferred\n                \n\nwhere defendant was informed (1) that all incoming calls, (2)\n\non   a  particular  line,   (3)  would  be   tape  recorded).\n\nAccordingly, we reject the contention that the court erred in\n\nfinding  that defendants  are not  protected  by the  consent\n\nexception.\n\n     2.  Refusal to Admit Expert Testimony\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n18.  It  is difficult to believe that the newly-installed CEO\nand  Chairman  of  the  Board  would  have  assented  to  the\nintercepting   and   recording   of   his  conversations   by\nsubordinates  with whom  he  was engaged  in  a struggle  for\npower.\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\n          Defendants  also assert  that  the  court erred  in\n\nrefusing  to  admit,  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Evid.  702,  the\n\ntestimony   of  their  expert,  G.  Robert  Blakey.19    This\n\nargument does not require extended discussion. \n\n          Rule 702 provides:   \"If scientific,  technical, or\n\nother specialized knowledge  will assist the trier of fact to\n\nunderstand the  evidence or to  determine a fact in  issue, a\n\nwitness  qualified   as  an   expert  by   knowledge,  skill,\n\nexperience, training, or  education, may  testify thereto  in\n\nthe form  of an  opinion or otherwise.\"   It is  settled that\n\n\"`the  admission  of  expert testimony  under  [Rule]  702 is\n\nwithin  the  discretion of  the  district court  and  will be\n\nreversed only for an abuse  of that discretion.'\"  Navarro de\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n19.  Blakey, described by  the CAR defendants as \"one  of the\ndrafters  and architects\" of Title III, would, in defendants'\nwords,  \"[have] address[ed] the  many mixed questions  of law\nand fact  which [arose] in  this action .  . . .\"   Indeed, a\nreview of  the Poulos  defendants' offer  of proof  regarding\nBlakey  reveals that,  if  he had  been  allowed to  testify,\nBlakey  would  have opined  on  virtually  all of  the  mixed\nquestions of law and fact in  this litigation.  Specifically,\nBlakey would  have testified, inter  alia, (1)  that the  CAR\n                                         \ndefendants'  monitoring  equipment  was  not  a  \"device\"  as\ndefined by  18 U.S.C.    2510(5)(a) or 15 M.R.S.A.    709(3);\n(2) that the  monitoring equipment \"was telephone  `equipment\nor facility'\" [sic], see 18 U.S.C.   2510(5)(a); (3) that the\n                        \nmonitoring at  issue was done \"within the  ordinary course of\n[CAR's]   business,\"  see  id.;  (4)  that  the  actions  and\n                              \nactivities of  the Poulos defendants  \"were carried out  in a\ngood faith reliance  on a statutory authorization  within the\nterms  of 18 U.S.C.    2520(d)\"; and (5)  that \"under all the\nrelevant facts and  circumstances, attorneys in the  position\nof the Poulos defendants . . .  would not have had `reason to\nknow' that  the  [intercepted] information  was  obtained  in\nviolation of law.\"  \n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nCosme v.  Hospital Pavia, 922  F.2d 926, 931 (1st  Cir. 1991)\n                        \n\n(quoting Forrestal v. Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 305 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1988)).\n\n          Here,  the  court  granted  plaintiffs'  motion  to\n\nexclude Blakey  by stating:   \"I'm satisfied  with regard  to\n\nexpert  witnesses in this case  that expert witnesses are not\n\nappropriate, . .  . and I have excluded  both the plaintiffs'\n\nand  the defendants' experts  by appropriate action  on their\n\nrespective motions.\"   Thus, it  appears that  the court,  as\n\nfactfinder, concluded that it could \"understand  the evidence\n\n[and]  determine   [the]  fact[s]  in   issue\"  without   the\n\nassistance of  experts.  Our review of  this record persuades\n\nus  that the  court acted  well within  its discretion  in so\n\nconcluding.20       Accordingly,   we    reject   defendants'\n\ncontention  that  the  court   erred  in  excluding  Blakey's\n\ntestimony.\n\n     3.  Mootness\n                 \n\n          The  Poulos  defendants   assert  that  plaintiffs'\n\nclaims against them became moot when plaintiffs amended their\n\n                    \n\n20.  The court's decision  rests upon especially firm  ground\nwith regard  to  Blakey.   The  Poulos defendants'  offer  of\nproof,  see  supra note  19,  reveals that  virtually  all of\n                  \nBlakey's  testimony   would  have   been  opinion   testimony\nregarding (1) the state of mind of the Poulos defendants, and\n(2)  the applicability of certain statutory provisions to the\nfacts  of this  case.   Leaving  aside overall  admissibility\nconcerns, it  is apparent  that such testimony  is not  based\nupon  \"scientific, technical, or . . . specialized knowledge\"\nlikely to be lacking in the able district judge who conducted\nthis bench trial.\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\ncomplaint  so   as  to   drop  their   claims  for   monetary\n\ndamages.21   In so  doing, they  point to  the fact that,  as\n\nthe  CAR defendants'  attorneys, they would  be bound  by any\n\ninjunction  or  restraining  order  issued  against  the  CAR\n\ndefendants  alone.   See Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 65(d).22   In  the\n                        \n\nPoulos  defendants'  view, the  fact  that they  would  be so\n\nbound, when combined with the  fact that the trial was solely\n\nfor equitable relief,  means that complete relief  could have\n\nbeen afforded to  plaintiffs without their presence  as named\n\ndefendants.   Thus, the argument concludes, after the damages\n\nclaims  were  dropped,   there  was  no  longer   a  case  or\n\ncontroversy between  plaintiffs and  themselves.   We  cannot\n\nagree with the Poulos defendants' argument.\n\n          Among  its  infirmities,  this  argument  fails  to\n\nrecognize that  plaintiffs sought from the  Poulos defendants\n\ntwo  forms  of  relief  other  than  an injunction.    First,\n                                   \n\nplaintiffs  sought a declaration  that the  Poulos defendants\n                                                             \n\nthemselves, irrespective  of their relationship  with the CAR\n          \n\n                    \n\n21.  In   their   original   complaint,   plaintiffs   sought\ndeclaratory  and  injunctive relief;  actual,  statutory, and\npunitive damages; and attorneys' fees.   Eventually, however,\nplaintiffs amended their complaint so as to dismiss all their\ndamages  claims.   As a  result,  the case  was reduced  to a\ncompletely  equitable   proceeding  tried  only   before  the\ndistrict court.\n\n22.  The part of Rule 65(d) upon which the  Poulos defendants\nrely states:   \"Every order granting an injunction  and every\nrestraining order . .  . is binding only upon  the parties to\nthe action, their officers, agents, servants,  employees, and\nattorneys . . . .\"\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\ndefendants,  had violated, inter alia, the disclosure and use\n                                     \n\nprovisions of  Title III  and the Maine  act.23   And second,\n\nplaintiffs  sought from the  Poulos defendants the attorneys'\n\nfees  they had  incurred in  the course  of protecting  their\n\nstatutorily created rights.  Thus, even if we were to endorse\n\nfor the sake  of argument the dubious premise  upon which the\n\nPoulos  defendants' argument rests, we are still compelled to\n\nconclude that  there was  a very  live  case and  controversy\n\nbetween plaintiffs and  the Poulos defendants.   Accordingly,\n\nwe  reject the contention that plaintiffs' claims against the\n\nPoulos defendants were mooted when they dropped their damages\n\nclaims.24\n\n     4.  Poulos's Knowledge\n                           \n\n                    \n\n23.  Despite  the fact that it is specifically made available\nby 18 U.S.C.   2520(b)(1), the Poulos defendants contend that\nsuch  a declaration,  standing  alone, would  be  \"completely\ninappropriate\" because  it would have no  future application.\nWe are not persuaded by this argument.  The Poulos defendants\nare the  attorneys of  record for the  CAR defendants  in the\nBowers  litigation.   Surely a  declaration  that the  Poulos\n      \ndefendants had disclosed and used the contents of intercepted\ncommunications, relevant to the  Bowers lawsuit, in violation\n                                       \nof  Title III and the Maine act would be useful to plaintiffs\nin  any  motion they  might  file  to  disqualify the  Poulos\ndefendants in that case.\n\n24.  The Poulos  defendants also  assert that the  injunction\nissued  against them was improper because plaintiffs were not\nin danger of suffering \"actual or imminent, not `conjectural'\nor `hypothetical'\" harm from them.  See Whitmore v. Arkansas,\n                                                            \n495  U.S. 149,  155 (1990)  (elaborating  upon Article  III's\n\"case or  controversy\"  requirement)  (quoting  City  of  Los\n                                                             \nAngeles v.  Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02  (1983)).  In light of\n                 \nthe  imminence  of  Bowers  and  the  fact  that  the  Poulos\n                          \ndefendants may still participate in  it, we find this line of\nargument entirely unconvincing.\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\n          The  Poulos   defendants  next  contend   that  the\n\ndistrict court clearly  erred when, in determining  that they\n\nhad violated the disclosure and use provisions of Title  III,\n\nit  found that Richard Poulos knew or had reason to know that\n\nthe  interceptions at issue had been effectuated in violation\n\nof Title III.   See 18 U.S.C.    2511(c) and (d),  supra note\n                                                        \n\n3.25   More particularly,  they argue that  the judge clearly\n\nerred  in implicitly deciding  that plaintiffs had  met their\n\nburden of proving that Poulos knew or had reason to know that\n\nthe  statutory business extension  and consent exceptions did\n\nnot  apply to the interceptions.  After carefully considering\n\nthis argument, we are not convinced.\n\n          It is  settled that  a person  has not  committed a\n\ndisclosure or use violation under Title III unless s/he \"knew\n\nor had  reason to  know that the  interception [by  which the\n\n                    \n\n25.  In the  course of so  ruling, the court also  found that\nthe Poulos  defendants had  violated the  disclosure and  use\nprovisions of the Maine act.  See 15 M.R.S.A.   710(3)(A) and\n                                 \n(B), supra note  3.  The Poulos defendants  also contest this\n          \nfinding, arguing (1) that the Maine act required the court to\nfind  that  they  had  disclosed  and  used  the  intercepted\ninformation  \"actually knowing\"  that it  had been  illegally\n                                                             \nobtained, and (2) that the  evidence could not support such a\nfinding.    This   argument  is  built  on   a  faulty  legal\nfoundation.    Section  710(3)(A)  and  (B)  do  not  require\nknowledge  that  the information  was  illegally intercepted;\nthey  merely  require  knowledge \"that  the  information  was\nobtained through interception [as that term is defined by the\nMaine act].\"  See supra note  3.  Accordingly, because of its\n                       \ndefective  premise,  and  because a  thorough  review  of the\nrecord convinces  us that  the court did  not clearly  err in\nimplicitly finding that  the Poulos defendants knew  that the\ninformation  they  disclosed  and  used  had  been  \"obtained\nthrough interception,\" we reject this argument.     \n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\ninformation  which was disclosed  or used had  been obtained]\n\nitself  was in  violation of  Title III.\"   United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nWuliger,  981  F.2d 1497,  1501  (10th Cir.  1992);  see also\n                                                             \n\nThompson  v. Dulaney, 970 F.2d 744, 749 (10th Cir. 1992).  In\n                    \n\nother  words, \"knowledge or reason to  know of the illegality\n\nis an  element of the  offense.\"  Wuliger, 981  F.2d at 1501.\n                                         \n\nThus, in a civil action, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"1) the\n\ninformation  used  or  disclosed  came  from  an  intercepted\n\ncommunication,  and  2)   sufficient  facts  concerning   the\n\ncircumstances of  the  interception such  that the  defendant\n\ncould, with presumed knowledge of the law, determine that the\n\ninterception   was  prohibited   in  light  of   Title  III.\"\n\nThompson, 970 F.2d  at 749; see also Cheek  v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n498 U.S.  192, 199-200 (1991)  (making clear that  the common\n\nlaw  presumption that every  person knows the  law ordinarily\n\napplies  when  courts  construe  criminal  statutes).    This\n\ndemonstration   includes  a   showing   that  any   statutory\n\nexceptions asserted by  a defendant do  not, in fact,  apply.\n\nSee Thompson, 970 F.2d at 749.\n            \n\n          Here,  we perceive no  clear error in  the district\n\ncourt's implicit findings that the statutory defenses did not\n\napply.  Insofar as the  Poulos defendants are challenging the\n\ncourt's finding  regarding the business  extension exception,\n\nwe again observe  that the exception applies only when, inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, the aural acquisition at issue is  effectuated by means\n    \n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nof  a  \"telephone  or   telegraph  instrument,  equipment  or\n\nfacility,  or  a  component  thereof.\"     See  18  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n2510(5)(a),  supra at  19.   As  noted earlier,  we think  it\n                  \n\nevident  that  the  monitoring  equipment  used  by  the  CAR\n\ndefendants cannot be so characterized.  Moreover, there is no\n\nsuggestion  that Poulos  misapprehended  the  nature  of  the\n\nequipment  the CAR  defendants  used  to monitor  plaintiffs'\n\ncalls.  Given these facts,  we discern no basis for upsetting\n\nthe court's  finding that Poulos  knew or had reason  to know\n\nthat  the business extension exception would not apply to the\n\nintercepted calls.\n\n          Similarly,  insofar  as the  Poulos  defendants are\n\ncontesting   the  court's   finding  regarding   the  consent\n\nexception, we again note that consent, even if  implied, must\n\nbe \"`consent in fact.'\"   See Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 116-17\n                                         \n\n(quoting Amen, 831 F.2d at  378).  As observed earlier, there\n             \n\nis  record evidence  tending to  indicate  that Dyer26  never\n\nwas informed  (1) of the  manner in which the  monitoring was\n\nbeing conducted; and  (2) that he himself would  be subjected\n\nto such monitoring.  Moreover,  there is record evidence from\n\nwhich  a  rational  factfinder  could  have  found,  under  a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence standard, that Poulos  was not\n\n                    \n\n26.  See supra note 17.\n              \n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\nlaboring  under  the   assumption  that  Dyer  had   been  so\n\ninformed.27  Thus,  we can  discern  no  clear error  in  the\n\ndistrict court's finding  that Poulos knew  or had reason  to\n\nknow  that  the consent  exception  would  not apply  to  the\n\nintercepted calls.  \n\n          Accordingly,  we  reject   the  Poulos  defendants'\n\nchallenge to  the  court's finding  that Poulos  knew or  had\n\nreason to know that the interceptions violated Title III.\n\n     5.  The Poulos Defendants' Good Faith Defense\n                                                  \n\n          The Poulos defendants' next argument, that the good\n\nfaith  defense  provided   for  in  18  U.S.C.      2520(d)28\n\nexonerates  them, is  a variation  on  this same  theme.   In\n\nessence, the  Poulos defendants  claim that  Poulos, in  good\n\nfaith,  believed  that  the business  extension  and  consent\n\nexceptions applied and were  \"statutory authorization[s]\" for\n\nthe wiretapping that occurred.  Thus, they  assert, they have\n\na  complete defense against plaintiffs' civil claims.  Again,\n\nwe do not agree.\n\n                    \n\n27.  For   example,  in  response  to  a  question  at  trial\nregarding a  journal entry  made by  Dyer, Poulos  testified:\n\"You people didn't know about  and Dyer didn't know about the\n                                                             \nwiretaps on August 25 or so and when he's talking about sue -\n        \n- [sic].\"   Also, when  Poulos disclosed the contents  of the\ntapes to  counsel for CAR's  Chapter 11 trustee,  he informed\nthem that the tapes might have been criminally obtained. \n\n28.  In relevant part,  18 U.S.C.   2520(d) states:   \"A good\nfaith reliance  on . . . a statutory authorization . . . is a\ncomplete defense against any civil or criminal action brought\nunder this chapter or any other law.\"\n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\n          As we  have stated, the district  court sustainably\n\nfound   that  Poulos  disclosed  and  used  the  contents  of\n\nintercepted communications despite, at the very least, having\n\nhad reason to  know that the interception  was effectuated in\n\nviolation  of  Title  III.    Therefore,  even  if we  assume\n\narguendo that the term \"statutory authorization\" in   2520(d)\n        \n\nencompasses the business extension  and consent exceptions (a\n\nmatter that  we do not  now decide),  it is evident  that any\n\nbelief on Poulos's part that these exceptions did apply could\n\nhave been  premised only  upon mistakes of  law.  And,  as we\n\nhave held,  nothing in    2520(d) supports a  conclusion that\n\nthe good faith  defense applies where a  defendant mistakenly\n                                                             \n\nbelieves  that there exists a statutory authorization for the\n\nwiretapping.    See  Campiti, 611  F.2d  at  394-95 (mistaken\n                            \n\nbelief that statutory  exceptions apply does not give rise to\n\na good  faith defense);29 see  also Heggy v. Heggy,  944 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1537,  1542 (10th  Cir.  1991) (   2520(d)  does not  embrace\n\nmistake  of  law),  cert. denied,  112  S.  Ct. 1514  (1992).\n                                \n\n                    \n\n29.

At  any rate,  we deem  it waived,  see\n                                                             \nUnited  States v.

Entitlement to Jury Trial\n                                  \n\n          Finally,  in one  sentence,  the Poulos  defendants\n\nassert:  \n\n          Due to the professional implications, the\n          exposure to  substantial attorneys  [sic]\n          fees, the [district]  court's decision to\n          determine  whether there  was  a use  and\n          disclosure  violation  under  both [Title\n          III] and  the Maine Act, and the criminal\n          nature  of  the  statute  involved,  [the\n          Poulos  defendants]   should  have   been\n          accorded a  jury trial on  the issues  of\n          whether  they used  the tapes  knowing or\n          with reason to know of the illegality and\n          the good-faith defense.  \n\nThey do not,  however, explain how the presence  in this case\n\nof \"professional  implications,\" an attorneys'  fees request,\n\nuse and disclosure  issues, and the fact that  Title III also\n\ncontains   criminal   provisions  renders   this   action  an\n\nessentially legal  one.   Nor do they  cite to  any authority\n\nfrom  which we can derive such an  inference.  As such, their\n\nargument  is perfunctory  and we  will not  address it.   See\n                                                             \n\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d at 468.31\n          \n\n                    \n\n30.  Because    2520(d) does not shield the Poulos defendants\nfrom plaintiffs'  Title III  claims, it  also obviously  does\nnot, despite their argument to the contrary, shield them from\nplaintiffs' claims under the Maine act.\n\n31.  The Poulos defendants do, without elaboration, advert to\nauthority  which enunciates the  settled rule that  an action\nfor declaratory relief  which is essentially legal  in nature\n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n\nB.  Plaintiffs' Arguments\n                         \n\n     1.  Scope of the Injunction\n                                \n\n          Plaintiffs'  primary  argument on  appeal  is their\n\ncomplaint  concerning the reach  of the injunction  issued by\n\nthe district court.  The  argument has three components:  (1)\n\nthat the court abused its discretion in permitting defendants\n\nto  disclose and/or use the intercepted recordings in Bowers;\n                                                            \n\n(2) that the  court also abused its discretion  in failing to\n\nenjoin   the  Bowers  litigation;  and  (3)  that  the  court\n                    \n\nerroneously thought itself restricted to the  relief provided\n\nfor  in 18  U.S.C.    251532 when  it issued  the injunction.\n\nWe address each branch of plaintiffs' argument in turn.\n\n          a.   Disclosure  and/or Use  of  the Recordings  in\n                                                             \nBowers\n      \n\n          The  first aspect  of  plaintiffs' argument  is not\n\ndifficult  to  comprehend.   They  contend  that  the court's\n\n                    \n\ngives rise to the right to  a jury trial.  See, e.g.,  Simler\n                                                             \nv.

They do  not, however,\n        \nmake any  attempt to  demonstrate the  applicability of  this\nauthority to  the facts of  this case.  Accordingly,  we deem\n                                     \ntheir   efforts  insufficient  to  preserve  this  issue  for\nappellate review.  See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 468.  \n                                 \n\n32.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C.   2515 provides:\n\n       Whenever any wire or oral communication has  been\n     intercepted,  no  part  of  the  contents  of  such\n     communication and no evidence derived therefrom may\n     be received in  evidence in any trial,  hearing, or\n     other proceeding  in or before  any court . .  . if\n     disclosure  of   that  information   would  be   in\n     violation of this chapter.\n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\ninjunction,  insofar as  it  permits  defendants to  disclose\n\nand/or  use the  contents  of  the  tapes  for  admissibility\n\ndeterminations in Bowers,  must be reversed.   In plaintiffs'\n                        \n\nview, Title III33  simply does not allow  for any disclosures\n\nand/or  use of illegally intercepted material in civil cases.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we disagree with this position.\n\n          In making their argument,  plaintiffs rely upon the\n\nfact  that  Title  III,  without  exception,  makes  criminal\n\n\"disclosures\"   and/or   \"uses\"  of   illegally   intercepted\n\nmaterial.   In  our view,  however,  there are  at least  two\n\nreasons why the lack of  any such explicit exception does not\n\ndictate the conclusion reached by plaintiffs.\n\n          First, we think it important to note:\n\n          A statute is passed as a whole and not in\n          parts or sections and is animated by  one\n          general      purpose      and     intent.\n          Consequently, each part or section should\n          be  construed  in connection  with  every\n          other  part or section so as to produce a\n          harmonious whole.\n\n2A  Norman J.  Singer,  Sutherland Statutory  Construction,  \n                                                          \n\n46.05, at 103 (5th ed. 1992).  Here, if we were  to interpret\n\nthe criminal provisions of Title  III in the manner suggested\n\nby plaintiffs,  we would render the  statute unenforceable.34\n\n                    \n\n33.  Again here, the parties' discussion of the issue centers\naround  Title  III.   Therefore, we  confine our  analysis to\nfederal law.\n\n34.  After all, a court (or  jury) would almost never be able\nto  determine  whether  an  interception  violated Title  III\nwithout  having the  interception  \"disclosed\"  in court  and\n\n                             -38-\n                              38\n\nThus, we must reject  plaintiffs' interpretation as violative\n\nof a fundamental tenet of statutory construction.\n\n          Moreover, we  think  that Congress,  in enacting   \n\n2515,  see  supra note  32,  made  clear its  endorsement  of\n                 \n\ndisclosures and/or uses of illegally intercepted material for\n\nthe adjudicatory purposes contemplated by the district court.\n\nAs noted,   2515 bans  the introduction into evidence of both\n\nillegally  intercepted  material  and  any  evidence  derived\n\ntherefrom.    Implicit  in  this  ban, we  believe,  are  two\n\nassumptions:    (1)  that the  intercepted  material  will be\n\npresented to a  court or jury for an  initial adjudication of\n\nwhether it was acquired illegally;  and (2) that a court will\n\nthereafter determine  whether other evidence was derived from\n\nthe  intercepted evidence.   Simply put, we are  at a loss to\n\nsee how these  functions could be performed without the types\n\nof adjudicatory  \"disclosures\" and/or \"uses\"  that plaintiffs\n\nview as banned by Title III.\n\n          Accordingly, we reject the argument that the  court\n\nerred in  permitting future  disclosures and/or  uses of  the\n\nrecordings and transcriptions  here at issue for  the limited\n\npurpose  of  aiding   it  in  the  making   of  admissibility\n\ndeterminations in Bowers.\n                        \n\n          Despite  the  fact  that  the  court's   injunction\n\nexplicitly  made reference only to disclosures and/or uses in\n\n                    \n\n\"using\" this interception to inform its determination.\n\n                             -39-\n                              39\n\nthe context of admissibility determinations, the parties also\n\ndisagree over  whether the  tapes at issue  can be  used \"for\n\npurposes of impeachment\" in Bowers.  Because we believe  that\n                                  \n\nthis is an important issue certain to arise during the course\n\nof that litigation, we address it at this time.\n\n          We start with  the obvious.   As we have  observed,\n\nTitle III  makes criminal  the intentional  disclosure and/or\n\nuse    of   information    obtained   through    unauthorized\n\ninterceptions  of  wire, oral,  or  electronic communications\n\n(when the discloser/user knows or has reason to know that the\n\ninterception was unauthorized).  See  18 U.S.C.   2511(c) and\n                                    \n\n(d), supra  note 3;  see also Gelbard  v. United  States, 408\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  41, 46 (1972).  It also  generally reserves as a remedy\n\nto anyone subjected  to an unlawful interception \"such  . . .\n\nequitable or declaratory  relief as may be appropriate.\"  See\n                                                             \n\n18 U.S.C.    2520(b), supra  note 5.   We think  it apparent,\n                           \n\ntherefore, that,  in  order to  provide aggrieved  plaintiffs\n\nwith   \"appropriate\"   relief,   courts   ordinarily   should\n\ncompletely   enjoin  persons   in  possession   of  illegally\n\nintercepted  information from  disclosing  and/or using  that\n\ninformation.\n\n          With   regard  to   how,  if   at  all,   illegally\n\nintercepted communications may  be disclosed  and/or used  as\n                                                             \n\nevidence  in court proceedings,  Title III is  more explicit.\n        \n\nAs noted above,   2515  states that \"no part of the  contents\n\n                             -40-\n                              40\n\nof such communication  and no evidence derived  therefrom may\n\nbe received in evidence . . . .\"  See supra note 32.  Despite\n                                           \n\nthe  unequivocal nature of  this statutory language, however,\n\nseveral  courts,   including  this  one,   have  allowed  the\n\ngovernment  to disclose  and use  the  contents of  illegally\n          \n\nintercepted  communications  in order  to  impeach testifying\n\ncriminal  defendants.  See  United States  v. Vest,  813 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n477, 484 (1st  Cir. 1987); United States v.

In  so doing,  these\n\ncourts, either explicitly  or implicitly, have relied  upon a\n\npassage  in  the  legislative  history  of  Title  III  which\n\nindicates a congressional desire  to incorporate, inter alia,\n                                                            \n\nthe  impeachment  exception  of  \"search and  seizure  law\"35\n\ninto the Title  III calculus.  See generally  Caron, 474 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 510  (interpreting the meaning  of S. Rep. No.  1097, 90th\n\n                    \n\n35.

Then,\n                \n\nthese  courts  have   observed  that  the  allowance   of  an\n\nimpeachment  exception  derives from  the  references  in the\n\nlegislative  history  to  \"search and  seizure  law\"  and the\n\nSupreme Court's  decision in Walder.

In an attempt  to counteract this authority,  the Poulos\ndefendants contend  (1) that  Walder and  its progeny do  not\n                                    \nexplicitly  state that  the impeachment  exception should  be\navailable only in criminal cases,  and (2) that the  concerns\nunderlying the exception (e.g., the  prevention of untruthful\ntestimony)  are equally  applicable  in  the  civil  context.\nWhile this argument has some force, we think, in light of (1)\nthe unequivocal language  of   2515,  (2) the broad  remedial\npurposes  of Title III, and (3)  the restrictions the Supreme\nCourt  has put on  the impeachment exception,  see supra note\n                                                        \n35,  that the  exception we  have read  into    2515 must  be\nstrictly construed.  Cf. Vest,  813 F.2d at 480-84 (declining\n                             \nto read the legislative history at issue as empowering courts\nto read further excep-tions into   2515).  As we have  noted,\nthe  exception derives from  a specific reference  to \"search\nand seizure law\"  and a citation to Walder,  neither of which\n                                          \nis  directly  applicable in  the  civil context.    Thus, any\n            \napplication of  the exception to  civil cases would  be based\nupon  extrapolation.    In light  of  the  three above-stated\nfactors which incline us towards a strict construction of the\nexception,   we  simply   do  not   believe   that  such   an\nextrapolation would be appropriate in this instance.\n\n                             -43-\n                              43\n\n          b.  Failure to Enjoin Bowers\n                                      \n\n          The second  component of  plaintiffs' argument  has\n\ntwo parts:   that, in failing to enjoin  Bowers, the district\n                                               \n\ncourt   (1)   erroneously   relied  upon   Fourth   Amendment\n\n\"independent  source\"  jurisprudence,38 and  (2)  erroneously\n\noverlooked  the fact that Title III \"flatly\" bans disclosures\n\nand uses of illegally intercepted  material.39  In our  view,\n\nplaintiffs  misconstrue the  approach taken  by the  district\n\ncourt.\n\n          With respect to plaintiffs' first claim,  the court\n\ndid  not hold  that  the evidence  derived  from the  illegal\n\ninterceptions would be  admissible in Bowers pursuant  to the\n                                            \n\nindependent source  rule.40   Instead, the  court found  that\n\n                    \n\n38.

To  be more  specific, the  second  part of  plaintiffs'\nargument  is that,  to the  extent  that the  court may  have\n\"balanced  the equities\" in deciding not to enjoin Bowers, it\n                                                         \nwas in  error.

(indicating that, in  considering the\npropriety of  injunctive relief,  it is not  the role  of the\ncourts  to balance  the equities  between  the parties  where\nCongress  has  flatly   banned  the  conduct  sought   to  be\nenjoined), cert. denied, 113 S.

In  other words, the\n\ncourt found  that evidence other  than that which was  on the\n                                      \n\ntapes (and  \"in no way  attributable to the existence  of the\n\nsubject  tapes,\" see id.  at 30)  could support  the lawsuit.\n                        \n\nThus,  the independent  source  rule, which  is  a means  for\n\nadmitting evidence springing from independent sources despite\n\nthe fact that  the evidence replicates tainted  evidence, was\n\nnot a basis for the district court's holding.\n\n          With regard to plaintiffs' second claim, we believe\n\nit sufficient to  state that the court's  injunction does not\n\ncontravene   the  purposes  of  Title  III.41    Contrary  to\n\nplaintiffs' assertions, Title  III does not \"flatly\"  ban all\n                                                             \n\ndisclosures and uses of illegally intercepted communications.\n\nInstead,  as  we  have  explained,  it  generally  bans  such\n                                                 \n\ndisclosures and uses while, either explicitly or  implicitly,\n\n                    \n\n41.  We  are aware  that plaintiffs'  argument  ties in  with\ntheir general concern, expressed throughout their brief, that\nallowing Bowers  to proceed  will undermine  the purposes  of\n               \nTitle  III  and  the  Maine  act.    If,  however,  there  is\nindependent evidence upon which the allegations of Bowers are\n                                                         \npremised,  and if, as we shall explicitly  urge it to do, see\n                                                             \ninfra at 48-50, the district court takes pains to ensure that\n     \nthe  contents of the illegally intercepted conversations, and\nany  evidence derived therefrom, are not used or disclosed in\nthe course  of that litigation  (other than in the  course of\nmaking admissibility determinations), we do not  believe that\nplaintiffs' concern will come to fruition.\n\n                             -45-\n                              45\n\nallowing  for   certain  exceptions  (i.e.,   an  impeachment\n\nexception  in criminal  cases,  see supra  at  40-41, and  an\n                                         \n\n\"adjudication\"  exception, see supra at 37-39, in all cases).\n                                    \n\nIn our view,  the court's injunction is  consistent with this\n\nstatutory nuance.  \n\n          Accordingly, we  reject plaintiffs'  assertion that\n\nthe  court's failure to  enjoin Bowers was  infected by legal\n                                      \n\nerror.\n\n          c.

While, as we  shall discuss below, the court did\n\nreveal a somewhat cramped view  of the scope of its equitable\n\npowers in denying plaintiffs' Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to\n\namend  judgment, see  infra  at  48-49,  the  record  clearly\n                           \n\nreveals  that no such restrictive view impaired its treatment\n\nof plaintiffs'  initial request  for injunctive  relief.   In\n\nfact,  contrary   to  plaintiffs'  contention,   the  court's\n\ninjunction order explicitly  states that the decision  not to\n\nenjoin Bowers  was based  upon the evidence,  and not  upon a\n             \n\nperceived lack of legal power to order  the remedy requested.\n\n                             -46-\n                              46\n\nSee Poulos II,  slip op. at 30 (\"The  Court is satisfied that\n             \n\nthe injunctive relief sought is beyond the scope warranted by\n                                                             \n\nthe  evidence  presented  at  trial.\")  (emphasis  supplied).\n                                   \n\nAccordingly, we find this claim  of legal error to be without\n\nmerit.\n\n     2.  Motion to Amend Judgment\n                                 \n\n          Plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred\n\nin  denying their  Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  59(e)  motion to  amend\n\njudgment.  In this motion, plaintiffs  averred that they were\n\nseeking,  inter  alia,  to  \"clarify\"  the  court's  previous\n                     \n\ninjunction order.  In reality, however, as the district court\n\nnoted,  plaintiffs'  motion actually  sought  (1) \"additional\n\nrelief\" not requested  at trial or in  the amended complaint,\n\nand (2)  evidentiary rulings in  Bowers.   Because the  court\n                                       \n\nacted  well within its discretion  in denying this relief, we\n\ncannot agree with plaintiffs that the court  erred in denying\n\ntheir motion.   Because, however, we do agree with plaintiffs\n\nthat the court's  denial order evinced a  misunderstanding of\n\n(1)  the scope  of its  powers, and  (2) the  requirements of\n\nTitle III, we do pause, albeit briefly, to add a few caveats.\n                                                            \n\n          The decision to  grant or deny a Rule  59 motion is\n\ncommitted to  the wide discretion  of the district  court and\n\nmust be respected absent abuse.  E.g., Fernandez  v. Leonard,\n                                                            \n\n963  F.2d  459,  468  (1st  Cir.  1992).    Of  course,  this\n\ndiscretion attaches to a court's decision on whether to allow\n\n                             -47-\n                              47\n\na party to argue new material or a new theory under  Rule 59.\n\nSee Appeal of  Sun Pipe Line Co.,  831 F.2d 22, 25  (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1987), cert.  denied, 486 U.S.  1055 (1988); but see  FDIC v.\n                                                          \n\nMeyer, 781 F.2d  1260, 1268 (7th Cir. 1986)  (motion to alter\n     \n\nor amend  judgment \"cannot be  used to raise  arguments which\n                          \n\ncould,  and  should,  have  been  made  before  the  judgment\n\nissued\") (emphasis supplied).\n\n          Here, plaintiffs' Rule 59  motion sought relief not\n\nrequested  in  their   amended  complaint.     For   example,\n\nplaintiffs asked  the court  to order, inter  alia, (1)  that\n                                                  \n\ndefendants \"turn over  for seal or destruction  every illegal\n\ntape and transcript,  and any record  of any sort  containing\n\nany contents of  illegal interceptions\"; (2) that  the Poulos\n\ndefendants  and Daniel Lilley and his  law firm42 be enjoined\n\nfrom   further  participation   in  Bowers;   (3)  that   the\n                                          \n\naforementioned  attorneys  be prohibited  from  communicating\n\nwith whatever  attorney/s might  replace them  as counsel  in\n\nBowers; (4)  that the  disclosure and/or  use of  depositions\n      \n\ntaken by  Poulos be  enjoined; and (5)  that defendants  with\n\nexposure  to the  intercepted recordings  be  prohibited from\n\ntestifying  in   Bowers.     In  their   complaint,  however,\n                       \n\nplaintiffs requested no such relief  as an alternative to the\n\nenjoining  of  Bowers.   Accordingly,  insofar  as  the court\n                     \n\n                    \n\n42.  Mr. Lilley has represented the CAR defendants throughout\nthis litigation.\n\n                             -48-\n                              48\n\ndenied   plaintiffs'  motion   because   the  motion   sought\n\n\"additional  relief\",  we  cannot  say  that  it  abused  its\n\ndiscretion.43\n\n          Nevertheless, we are  concerned about certain dicta\n\ncontained in  the district court's  order.  In the  course of\n\ndenying plaintiffs' Rule  59 motion, the court  indicated (1)\n\nthat  18 U.S.C.     2515,  see supra  note  32, and  (2)  the\n                                    \n\nindependent source rule,  see supra note 38,  would constrain\n                                   \n\nits rulings in Bowers.   We think that the court  erred in so\n                     \n\nindicating.  First, we wish to emphasize that, as always, the\n\ncourt  has   broad  discretion,  through   discovery  orders,\n\nevidentiary rulings, and  the like, in  deciding how it  will\n\nmanage that  trial.  See,  e.g., Serrano-Perez v.  FMC Corp.,\n                                                            \n\n985 F.2d 625,  628 (1st Cir. 1993) (district  court has broad\n\ndiscretion in managing litigation).  However, in Bowers, this\n                                                       \n\ndiscretion  must  be  tempered  by  the  court's  obligation,\n\nflowing from the  protections set forth in Title  III and the\n\nMaine act, to ensure that the illegally intercepted material,\n\nand  any evidence derived therefrom, not be disclosed or used\n\nin  that proceeding  (other  than for  the  purposes we  have\n\nalready  approved,  see  supra  section  III.B.1.a.  of  this\n                              \n\nopinion).    In  our view,  this  discretion  and concomitant\n\nobligation will require the court to consider the possibility\n\n                    \n\n43.  Similarly,  we  cannot  say that  the  court  abused its\ndiscretion  in deferring the making of evidentiary rulings in\nBowers.\n      \n\n                             -49-\n                              49\n\nof rulings that go beyond   2515, which is directed solely at\n\nevidence.  For example, in  order to guard against the future\n\nuse of the intercepted material, as the term use is generally\n\nunderstood, we believe that the court should consider matters\n\nsuch  as (1)  the  disqualification of  counsel, and  (2) the\n\nprohibition  of  any communication  between  any disqualified\n\ncounsel and replacement counsel.\n\n          This leads  to our  second point.    In making  its\n\nrulings, the court  should be aware that, as  a general rule,\n\nFourth  Amendment doctrines like  the independent source rule\n\ndo not apply in private  civil actions implicating Title III.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has stated:\n\n               The purpose of  the Fourth Amendment\n          is to  prevent unreasonable  governmental\n          intrusions  into  the  privacy  of  one's\n          person, house,  papers, or effects.   The\n          wrong   condemned   is   the  unjustified\n          governmental invasion  of these  areas of\n          an individual's private life.  That wrong\n          .  .  .  is  fully  accomplished  by  the\n          original search without probable cause.\n\nUnited States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 354 (1974) (allowing\n                         \n\na grand jury witness to  be asked questions based on evidence\n\nobtained  in violation  of  Fourth  Amendment,  because  such\n\nquestions \"work no new Fourth Amendment wrong\").  \n\n          Title III, on the other hand, generally proscribes,\n\ninter   alia,   the  disclosure   and/or  use   of  illegally\n            \n\nintercepted material.  In other words, it prohibits more than\n                                                        \n\njust the initial wrongful invasion.  See Gelbard, 408 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n                             -50-\n                              50\n\n51-52.  Thus,  under Title III, the disclosure  and/or use of\n\ninformation obtained through a wrongful invasion amounts to a\n\nseparate injury  prohibited by  statute, and  makes a  person\n\nsubjected to  such a  disclosure and/or  use \"a  victim, once\n\nagain, of  a federal crime.\"   Id.  at 52 (ruling  that grand\n                                  \n\njury witness  may not  be asked  questions based on  evidence\n                     \n\nobtained by illegal wiretapping).\n\n          In  sum, the court  did not abuse  its considerable\n\ndiscretion in denying  plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion.   However,\n\nin making discovery, evidentiary, or other rulings in Bowers,\n                                                            \n\nthe court should  not (1) assume  that it  is limited to  the\n\nrelief set forth  in   2515, or (2)  assume the applicability\n\nof judicially developed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n     3.  Statutory Damages\n                          \n\n          Plaintiffs' third argument is  that the court erred\n\nin determining that the statutory damages provided  for in 18\n\nU.S.C.    2520(c), see supra  note 5, are legal,  rather than\n                            \n\nequitable, in nature.  Defendants respond that plaintiffs did\n\nnot  preserve this argument  for appellate review.   We agree\n\nwith defendants that this issue is not properly preserved.\n\n          As noted  earlier, see  supra note  21, plaintiffs'\n                                       \n\noriginal complaint sought  declaratory and injunctive relief;\n\nactual, statutory, and punitive damages; and attorneys' fees.\n\nAs the trial date approached, however,  plaintiffs apparently\n\ndetermined  that they did  not wish to  have a  jury hear any\n\n                             -51-\n                              51\n\nportion  of this  case.    Accordingly,  they  amended  their\n\ncomplaint  so as  to  drop all  but  their statutory  damages\n\nclaims.  Then, in their final pretrial memorandum, plaintiffs\n\nstated:  \"If  the Court should decide  that statutory damages\n\nare  a legal  remedy so  as to  support the  Defendants' jury\n\ndemand, then the  Allied Plaintiffs will dismiss  their claim\n\nfor statutory damages.\"   Subsequently, the court  ruled that\n\nstatutory  damages are  legal in  nature.   Thus,  plaintiffs\n\nfurther amended their  complaint so as  to omit their  prayer\n\nfor statutory damages.\n\n          Plaintiffs now  seek to  resurrect their  statutory\n\ndamages claim.  This they cannot do.  If plaintiffs wished to\n\npreserve  this issue, they  should have presented  their case\n\nfor statutory damages to a jury.  Cf., e.g., Foley v. City of\n                                                             \n\nLowell, 948 F.2d 10, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"`It is black letter\n      \n\nlaw that it is a party's  first obligation to seek any relief\n\nthat might fairly have been thought available in the district\n\ncourt  before seeking it  on appeal.'\") (quoting  Beaulieu v.\n                                                          \n\nIRS, 865  F.2d 1351,  1352 (1st  Cir. 1989)).   If  they were\n   \n\ndispleased  with  the  results of  the  jury's deliberations,\n\nplaintiffs next could have asked  the court to set the jury's\n\ndetermination  aside.    If they  still  were  not satisfied,\n\nplaintiffs then could  have appealed the court's  decision to\n\ncommit  the statutory  damages question  to the  jury  in the\n\nfirst instance.\n\n                             -52-\n                              52\n\n          Plaintiffs'  approach to  this issue,  if endorsed,\n\nwould undermine the efficient administration of justice.  Had\n\nplaintiffs presented their  claim for statutory damages  to a\n\njury, and  had they  received the  award they  sought (either\n\nfrom the  jury itself  or from the  court after  a successful\n\nRule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law), the need for\n\nan appeal on this point  would have been obviated.  Moreover,\n\neven if  plaintiffs had  not received  the  relief they  were\n\nseeking, the issues  underlying the propriety of  a statutory\n\ndamage award would have been fully litigated at the same time\n\nas  the other  issues animating  this litigation.   Thus,  we\n\nwould have been in a  position, on a developed record, either\n\nto resolve the question ourselves or to remand for what would\n\nundoubtedly  be  a   less  involved  process  than   the  one\n\nplaintiffs now seek.\n\n          In sum, when plaintiffs amended  their complaint so\n\nas   to  drop  their   claim  for  statutory   damages,  they\n\nirrevocably waived their right thereto.  Accordingly, we need\n\nnot reach  the question  of whether the  court erred  when it\n\ndetermined,  prior  to  plaintiffs'  final  amendment,   that\n\nstatutory damages under   2520(c) are legal in nature.\n\n     4.  Disclosure and Use Violations by the CAR Defendants\n                                                            \n\n          Finally, in one-half of one page of their fifty-one\n\npage  brief,  plaintiffs  contend  that  the  district  court\n\ncommitted legal error in ruling  that the CAR defendants  did\n\n                             -53-\n                              53\n\nnot  violate the disclosure  and use provisions  of Title III\n\nand the Maine  act.  The CAR defendants,  utilizing just over\n\nthree-quarters of one  page of their forty-eight  page brief,\n\ncounter  that any  disclosures and  uses on  their part  took\n\nplace   within   the   confines   of   the    attorney-client\n\nrelationship, and that such fact absolves them from liability\n\nunder the  relevant statutory provisions.   Plaintiffs, again\n\nusing  less than  one-half of  one page of  their forty-eight\n\npage   reply   brief,    characterize   this   argument    as\n\n\"incomprehensible\"  and restate their  position that  the CAR\n\ndefendants committed disclosure and use violations.   Neither\n\nside,  at  any  point,  makes  reference  to  any  case  law,\n\nstatutory authority, or legislative history.\n\n          The issue here adverted to is an interesting one on\n\nwhich no federal appeals court has yet spoken:  namely, do 18\n\nU.S.C.   2511(c) and (d) (and, correspondingly, 15 M.R.S.A.  \n\n710(3)(A) and  (B)), see supra  note 3, which by  their terms\n                              \n\nprohibit the \"disclos[ure] . . . to any other person\" and the\n\n\"use\" of illegally  intercepted material, make it a  crime to\n\ndisclose and use such material  during the course of attorney\n\nconsultations?44   Certainly, reasonable  arguments might  be\n\n                    \n\n44.  At  least one  federal  judge, recognizing  the inherent\ntension between the  wording of the statute and  the need for\neffective  trial preparation, has held that the disclosure of\nthe  contents of intercepted  recordings to counsel,  for the\n                                                             \npurpose  of preparing a defense, is not a crime.

(\"CAR\"), defendants Wayne Bowers, Rodney Rodrigue, and John Robichaud (hereinafter \"the CAR defendants\"), violated the federal and Maine anti-wiretap statutes when they intercepted and recorded telephone calls made by and to plaintiffs, who were employees or former employees of Allied Capital Corporation (\"Allied\") and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(a) and 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court also held that counsel retained by the CAR defendants, defendants Richard E. Poulos and the law firm of Poulos, Campbell &amp; Zendzian, P.A.  (hereinafter \"the Poulos defendants\"), violated 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d) and 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(3)(A) and (B) when they disclosed and used the recordings of the telephone calls at issue with the requisite mens rea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result, the court enjoined all defendants \"from further using and disclosing information contained in the subject interceptions except to obtain rulings regarding admissibility in [an] underlying suit [brought by the CAR defendants against plaintiffs].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See 18 U.S.C.

Both the CAR defendants and the Poulos defendants challenge sundry factual findings and legal judgments, arguing essentially that their respective actions did not run afoul of Title III and the Maine anti-wiretap statute.  Plaintiffs' primary claim is that the court's injunction does not sufficiently remedy the harm they have suffered and are continuing to suffer.  After carefully reviewing the record and the parties' arguments, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following detailed recitation is derived from the factual findings made by the district court in conjunction with Allied's motion for preliminary injunctive relief, see Williams v. Poulos, 801 F.Supp. 867, 868-72 (D.Me.1992) (\"Poulos I\"), and after the conclusion of the bench trial.  See Williams v. Poulos, Civ. No. 92-0069-B, slip op. at 3-10 (D.Me. February 4, 1993) (\"Poulos II \").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is but one in a series of civil lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings which can be traced to the collapse of CAR.  CAR was founded in 1988 in order to dismantle automobiles and resell used parts.  By May 1990, CAR employed approximately one hundred and forty people and operated throughout New England and in the Atlantic provinces of Canada.  Twenty people worked in CAR's East Vassalboro, Maine, headquarters, including Bowers, Rodrigue, and Robichaud, the CAR defendants.  These three owned 95% of CAR's stock and were members of CAR's Board of Directors (\"the Board\").  In addition, Bowers was CAR's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Treasurer, while Rodrigue served as CAR's President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To finance its early growth and operations, CAR developed a banking relationship with Casco Northern Bank.  In February 1990, Casco Northern refused to increase CAR's lines of credit.  As a result, CAR found itself in a serious financial bind because it had already spent the additional money it expected to receive.  Accordingly, CAR turned to Allied, a venture capital firm which had previously invested in it.  Allied responded with a large infusion of capital that raised its total investment in CAR to approximately $4,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this additional funding, CAR was unable to resolve its financial difficulties.  On May 29, 1990, Casco Northern declared CAR in default on its obligations.  Two days later, Allied followed suit.  On June 28, 1990, in an attempt to resolve the crisis, the CAR defendants entered into an agreement with Allied which came to be known as the \"Midnight Agreement.\"   Under its terms, Ralph A. Dyer was made CAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board, three representatives of Allied, plaintiffs George C. Williams, David Gladstone, and Frederick Russell, Jr., became members of the Board, and David Parker became an officer.  The Agreement also provided that the CAR defendants would remain on the Board, that Bowers would retain his position as Treasurer, and that Rodrigue would continue as President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, in May 1990, the CAR defendants had commissioned Michael Leighton, who owned Probe Investigating Service, Inc.  (\"Probe\"), to provide a system for electronically monitoring employee phone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The CAR defendants felt that a surveillance system was needed (1) to reduce CAR's telephone bills, and (2) decrease employee theft.  At the time they installed the system, the CAR defendants apparently received impromptu advice from Attorney Nicholas Lanzilotta that \"monitoring would not be illegal if notice was first given to the monitored employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After examining CAR's telephone system, Leighton concluded that he lacked the skill and expertise to create an appropriate monitoring system.  He therefore sought assistance from Jonathan Broome.  Broome's principal business was repairing consumer electronics;  he was not an authorized telephone system technician.  Although Broome considered the project to be unusual, Leighton assured him of its legality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 17, 1990, Broome, working after hours along with CAR security officer David Fisher, installed a custom-designed monitoring system<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in CAR's East Vassalboro headquarters.  In its findings of fact, the district court described the system as follows:The system ... consisted of small alligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one end and a \"punch-down\" at the other.  The wires to all the extension lines in CAR's offices were assembled on the punch-down.  Calls could be intercepted by attaching the alligator clips and microphone wire to a designated extension line on the punch-down.  The system could only monitor one extension at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The monitoring system designed by Broome also involved an interface connecting the microphone cable to a VCR and a video camera.  The VCR allowed the system to record calls for up to eight hours.  The video camera recorded the view meter on the VCR, allowing a person to fast forward the VCR tape until the meter indicated the presence of audio information.  The VCR, video camera and interface were mounted together on a plywood board and set up in an unused bathroom next to the area containing the punch-down.  Connecting wires were run through and over a suspended ceiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Poulos II, slip op. at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in June 1990, Rodrigue informed the managers at CAR that all telephone calls at CAR's offices would be subject to random monitoring and recording.  He also instructed the managers to inform their subordinates of the new monitoring policy.  At about the same time, Rodrigue directed employees to record long distance phone calls on provided telephone logs.  The employees were told that the logging system was to be used in conjunction with the monitoring system to reduce costs.  On June 29, 1990, Rodrigue told the new CEO, Dyer, that CAR had a system in place to deter employee phone abuse by randomly monitoring employee phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Fisher learned how to operate the monitoring system.  At first, he was instructed by the CAR defendants to monitor the extension lines randomly.  After a short time, however, the CAR defendants told him which lines to intercept.  Fisher was further instructed to deliver the tapes of recorded conversations to Wayne Bowers each day.  Bowers then made cassette tapes of those telephone conversations he wished to save.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 21, 1990, Fisher was instructed to monitor the telephone line of CAR Chief Financial Officer Richard Lee, who had been hired on Allied's recommendation.  Apparently, Rodrigue and Bowers doubted Lee's loyalty to CAR.  A few weeks later, however, the monitoring system was attached to the phone line of Jim Starr, an accountant from an outside firm who had been assigned to audit CAR.  The CAR defendants suspected that Starr was misusing the telephone system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same general time period, Dyer's relationship with the CAR defendants, which had been strained from the beginning, was rapidly deteriorating.  By July 10, 1990, Rodrigue and Robichaud were openly feuding with him.  On July 12, 1990, Dyer fired Rodrigue and Robichaud.  About a week after the firing, Dyer obtained a temporary restraining order barring Rodrigue and Robichaud from the CAR premises and prohibiting them from conducting any business on the company's behalf.  Meanwhile, on July 17 or 18, 1990, Dyer began occupying Starr's office and using Starr's telephone line.  Between July 18, 1990, and July 25, 1990, a number of Dyer's telephone calls were intercepted and recorded.  The CAR defendants admit that, by July 19, 1990, they were specifically targeting Dyer's conversations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, 1990, the CAR defendants met with attorneys Richard E. Poulos, John S. Campbell, and Paul F. Zendzian, the partners of Poulos, Campbell &amp; Zendzian, P.A., to discuss possible legal representation in matters involving CAR, Allied, and Dyer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> At that meeting, the existence of a tape containing recorded telephone conversations between Dyer and Allied employees and representatives was disclosed to the Poulos defendants.  The Poulos defendants made no inquiry into either how the tape was obtained or whether there was employee notice or consent.  They did, however, advise the CAR defendants to boycott a Board meeting that was scheduled for July 23, 1990.  That meeting, which was held telephonically so that the out-of-town Allied employees could participate, was taped by the CAR defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All monitoring and taping of telephone conversations at CAR's headquarters was discontinued on July 25, 1990.  On that same date, audio cassettes of some of the conversations that had been taped were delivered to the Poulos defendants, who soon thereafter agreed to represent the CAR defendants in the Bowers lawsuit.  See supra note 4.  Over the following six weeks, paralegals from the Poulos firm prepared transcripts of the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1990, pursuant to a certificate filed by Dyer with the United States Bankruptcy Court, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding was initiated on behalf of CAR.  Anthony Swenson was appointed Chapter 11 trustee for CAR on August 10, 1990.  On August 14, 1990, Swenson fired Dyer and rehired Bowers, Rodrigue, and Robichaud.  Subsequently, the bankruptcy proceeding was converted to Chapter 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early August 1990, Poulos asked Stuart W. Tisdale, an associate attorney in his office, to prepare a memorandum concerning the legality of intercepting wire communications.  In discussing the research assignment with Tisdale, Poulos stated that Dyer knew about the taping in question.  After reading Tisdale's memorandum, Poulos and Campbell were satisfied that at least some of the information from the tapes might be admissible as evidence or would be otherwise useful in the case against Allied.  In the district court's view, however, they did not \"follow through on their research on the issue of consent and the legality of the interceptions.\"   Poulos II, slip op. at 8.  Nor did they \"make an effort to determine directly whether Dyer and the other Allied employees whose conversations were intercepted knew of or consented to the monitoring.\"   Id.  Finally, the Poulos defendants \"did not consult with bar counsel or advise any court of the existence and use of the information derived from the telephone conversations.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3 and 4, 1990, Poulos read the transcripts of most of the recorded conversations that had been preserved.  On October 31, 1990, he disclosed contents of the tapes to Daniel Amory and David Crocker, counsel to the CAR Chapter 11 trustee.  In so doing, Poulos told Amory and Crocker that the tapes he possessed might have been criminally obtained.  He also asked them to keep the existence and contents of the tapes strictly confidential.  In November and December of 1990, Poulos again reviewed the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, October, and early November of 1990, the Poulos defendants obtained a large number of documents previously delivered by Allied to CAR's Chapter 11 trustee.  The documents were produced without any involvement of the Poulos defendants and without any connection to the existence of the taped telephone conversations.  These documents included notes, memoranda, and other written records of telephone conversations that had been taped on July 18, 19, 20, and 23, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, the CAR defendants filed the Bowers lawsuit, seeking $63,000,000 in damages from Allied, Dyer, and Leo Madden, a business associate of Dyer's.  After the complaint was filed, all discovery was stayed until December 5, 1991.  During January 1992, shortly after the discovery stay was lifted, Poulos took the depositions of Williams, Parker, Dyer, and Madden.  Poulos used both the discovery documents pertaining to the taped conversations and the tapes of the conversations themselves in preparing for the aforementioned depositions.  Following these depositions, Poulos revealed the existence of the tapes to counsel for Madden and Dyer.  In so doing, he (1) told counsel that the tapes proved that Madden and Dyer had lied during their depositions, and (2) offered to settle with them.  No settlement was reached between the parties, and the present lawsuit was filed by Allied on April 17, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the parties are challenging determinations made by the district court prior to and in conjunction with the bench trial, our standard of review is familiar.  Claimed errors of law are, of course, reviewed de novo.  E.g., Dedham Water Co., Inc. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992);  LoVuolo v. Gunning, 925 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1991).  Findings of fact, however, will not be set aside unless they are demonstrated to be clearly erroneous.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457.   In other words, we will give such findings effect unless, after carefully reading the record and according due deference to the trial court's superior ability to judge credibility, we form \" 'a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.' \"  Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457 (quoting Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990)).  As a result, where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the interpretation assigned by the lower court must be adopted.  Rodriguez-Morales v. Veterans Admin., 931 F.2d 980, 982 (1st Cir.1991) (citing Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clearly erroneous standard also ordinarily applies when we review a trial court's resolution of mixed questions of law and fact.  E.g., LoVuolo, 925 F.2d at 25;  Henry v. Connolly, 910 F.2d 1000, 1003 (1st Cir.1990).  In such situations, however, we are obligated to determine whether the court's resolution was infected by legal error.  See LoVuolo, 925 F.2d at 25.   And, \" 'if a trial court bases its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, the reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard.' \"  Id. (quoting Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 855 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2189 n. 15, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to Allied's attack upon the nature and extent of the injunction issued by the district court, our framework for review is equally well-established.  Just as a trial court's decision on whether to exercise its equitable powers is committed to its sound discretion, Taino Lines, Inc. v. M/V Constance Pan Atlantic, 982 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1992), so too is its choice of equitable remedies, Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).  Thus, our role is to review only for an abuse of that discretion.  Taino, 982 F.2d at 24.   Underlying this deferential standard is a recognition that, in exercising its equitable powers, the district court \" 'has had first-hand exposure to the litigants and the evidence and is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal.' \"  Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte, 925 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.)  (quoting Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 323) (ellipses omitted)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 637, 116 L.Ed.2d 655 (1991).  Nonetheless, we will reverse if the court committed a clear error of law.  See In re Boston and Maine Corp., 719 F.2d 493, 495 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 938, 104 S.Ct. 1913, 80 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984);  see also Feinstein v. Space Ventures, Inc., 989 F.2d 49, 51 (1st Cir.1993) (reviewing preliminary injunction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this backdrop that we evaluate the parties' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the CAR and Poulos defendants together contend (1) that the court erred in rejecting their arguments that two statutory exceptions--the \"business extension\" and \"consent\" exceptions--shielded them from liability;  and (2) that the court erroneously refused to admit certain expert testimony.  In addition, the Poulos defendants alone assert (1) that the court erred in ruling that plaintiffs' claims for equitable relief against them were not moot;  (2) that the court erred in determining that Poulos had acted with sufficient knowledge to have violated Title III and the Maine anti-wiretap statute;  (3) that the court erred in rejecting their claim that the statutory \"good faith\" defense relieved them of liability;  and (4) that the court erred in denying them a jury trial on these latter two issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' complaints essentially are (1) that the court made mistakes of law in fashioning equitable relief for the violations it found;  (2) that the court erred in denying their Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment;  (3) that the court erred in ruling that statutory damages under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520 are legal, and not equitable, in nature;  and (4) that the court erred in holding that the CAR defendants were not liable for use and disclosure violations under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Defendants' Arguments</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Statutory Exceptions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As both the CAR and Poulos defendants point out, not all aural acquisitions of wire, oral, and electronic communications are illegal and give rise to liability under Title III and the Maine act.  In fact, these statutes specifically delineate certain acquisitions that do not give rise to such liability.  Defendants argue that the district court erred in ruling that two of these defined exceptions--the business extension and consent exceptions--did not apply.  Our review, however, persuades us that the court's rulings are supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Business Extension Exception<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The business extension exception, often called the \"extension telephone\" exception, see, e.g., Campiti v. Walonis, 611 F.2d 387, 392 (1st Cir.1979), places outside the reach of Title III the monitoring of communications carried out by certain types of equipment and done in the ordinary course of business.  It derives from 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(4) and (5).  Section 2510(4) defines the term \"interception\" as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Section 2510(5), insofar as is relevant, then defines \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" in the following manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) ... furnished by [a] subscriber or user for connection to the facilities of [a wire or electronic communication] service and used in the ordinary course of its business[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Thus, if the monitoring conducted by the CAR defendants had been effectuated by means of a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof\" which was both furnished by CAR for connection to the facilities of its communication service and used in the ordinary course of its business, defendants' actions would not constitute an interception and would be beyond the reach of Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the business extension exception did not apply for two reasons:  (1) because \"the subject conversations were intercepted and recorded by a device configured by someone other than a provider of electronic communication service\";  and (2) because \"a legitimate business purpose did not exist at the time the subject conversations were intercepted.\"   See Poulos II, slip op. at 17.  Perhaps recognizing the amount of deference owed to the court's resolution of this paradigmatic mixed question of law and fact, defendants do not expend a great amount of energy attacking the factual findings underpinning the court's conclusions.  Instead, they argue that the court's ruling was infected by erroneous legal reasoning.  More specifically, defendants assert that, with regard to its first stated reason, the court misapprehended the technical requirements of the statute, and, with regard to its second stated reason, the court misconstrued the term \"ordinary course of business.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendants that, in concluding that the business extension exception did not apply, the court erred in its reasoning.  Section 2510(5)(a) does not require that the acquisition device be configured by a provider of electronic communication service.  Nor does it direct courts to conduct an inquiry into whether a \"legitimate business purpose\" for monitoring exists at the time of the challenged aural acquisition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we believe the district court's ultimate determination, that the business extension exception does not apply, is sustainable.  Simply put, we are at a loss to see how the monitoring system used here, consisting as it did of \"alligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one end\" and an \"interface connecting [a] microphone cable to a VCR and a video camera\" on the other, can be considered to be a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a[ ] component thereof.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In so stating, we note that the CAR system is factually remote from the telephonic and telegraphic equipment courts have recognized as falling within the exception at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a).  See, e.g., Epps v. St. Mary's Hosp., 802 F.2d 412, 415-16 (11th Cir.1986) (dispatch console installed by telephone company considered telephone equipment);  Watkins v. L.M. Berry &amp; Co., 704 F.2d 577, 582-84 (11th Cir.1983) (standard extension telephone implicitly considered telephone equipment);  Briggs v. American Air Filter Co., Inc., 630 F.2d 414, 416-20 (5th Cir.1980) (same);  James v. Newspaper Agency Corp., 591 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir.1979) (monitoring device installed by telephone company implicitly considered telephone equipment).  Indeed, we think it self evident that the CAR system, far from being the type of exempt equipment contemplated by the authors of the business extension exception, is precisely the type of intercepting device Congress intended to regulate heavily when it enacted Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that it is not ordinarily the province of appellate courts to make findings of fact or to resolve, in the first instance, mixed questions of law and fact.  Yet, where only one resolution of a predominantly factbound question would, on a full record, be sustainable, courts of appeals can, and often should, decline to remand where there has been an error committed.  See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 463;  see also In re Two Appeals Arising Out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 994 F.2d 956, 968-69 (1st Cir.1993) (appellate courts may eschew remand where remanding would be an empty exercise);  Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Casa Helvetia, Inc., 982 F.2d 633, 642 (1st Cir.1992) (where trial court \"supportably 'made the key findings of fact' but applied the wrong rule of law, the court of appeals ha[s] the power, in lieu of remanding, simply to regroup the findings 'along the proper matrix' \") (quoting United States v. Mora, 821 F.2d 860, 869 (1st Cir.1987)).  Here, given the trial court's findings regarding the nature of the monitoring device, the only sustainable ruling would be that the device was not a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a component thereof,\" and therefore not within the parameters of the business extension exception.  Accordingly, we reject the argument that defendants are protected by this exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The Consent Exception</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the federal and Maine acts specifically exempt from their prohibitions the interceptions of telephone calls where one or more of the conversants has consented to or, in the case of the Maine act, previously authorized the interception.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(d) and 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 709(4)(C).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-2\" id=\"fn15-2_ref\">15</a>  As we have made clear, consent under Title III<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> need not be explicit;  instead, it can be implied.  See Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 116 (1st Cir.1990).  Implied consent is not, however, constructive consent.  Id.  \"Rather, implied consent is 'consent in fact' which is inferred 'from surrounding circumstances indicating that the party knowingly agreed to the surveillance.' \"  Id. at 116-17 (quoting United States v. Amen, 831 F.2d 373, 378 (2d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1021, 108 S.Ct. 1573, 99 L.Ed.2d 889 (1988)) (brackets omitted) (emphasis supplied).  In light of the prophylactic purposes of Title III, implied consent should not be casually inferred.  See id. at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record reflects and the district court found that Ralph Dyer was told of the \"monitoring\" of CAR employee telephone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  The record is not clear, however, as to whether Dyer was informed (1) of the manner--i.e., the intercepting and recording of telephone conversations--in which this monitoring was conducted;  and (2) that he himself would be subjected to such monitoring.  There was testimony tending to indicate that he was so informed, which the district judge apparently chose not to credit, and testimony tending to indicate that he was not.  In our view, the latter testimony, far from being incredible, was highly plausible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Thus, there is no basis for us to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Dyer was not told of the manner in which the monitoring was conducted and that he himself would be monitored.  Cf. Rodriguez-Morales, 931 F.2d at 982 (district court's finding should not be disturbed where there are two permissible views of the evidence).  And, without at least this minimal knowledge on the part of Dyer, we do not see how his consent in fact to the monitoring could be inferred from this record.  Cf. Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 117 (implied consent inferred where defendant was informed (1) that all incoming calls, (2) on a particular line, (3) would be tape recorded).  Accordingly, we reject the contention that the court erred in finding that defendants are not protected by the consent exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Refusal to Admit Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also assert that the court erred in refusing to admit, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702, the testimony of their expert, G. Robert Blakey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  This argument does not require extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 702 provides:  \"If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\"   It is settled that \" 'the admission of expert testimony under [Rule] 702 is within the discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.' \"  Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pavia, 922 F.2d 926, 931 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Forrestal v. Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 305 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to exclude Blakey by stating:  \"I'm satisfied with regard to expert witnesses in this case that expert witnesses are not appropriate, ... and I have excluded both the plaintiffs' and the defendants' experts by appropriate action on their respective motions.\"   Thus, it appears that the court, as factfinder, concluded that it could \"understand the evidence [and] determine [the] fact[s] in issue\" without the assistance of experts.  Our review of this record persuades us that the court acted well within its discretion in so concluding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Accordingly, we reject defendants' contention that the court erred in excluding Blakey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Poulos defendants assert that plaintiffs' claims against them became moot when plaintiffs amended their complaint so as to drop their claims for monetary damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  In so doing, they point to the fact that, as the CAR defendants' attorneys, they would be bound by any injunction or restraining order issued against the CAR defendants alone.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  In the Poulos defendants' view, the fact that they would be so bound, when combined with the fact that the trial was solely for equitable relief, means that complete relief could have been afforded to plaintiffs without their presence as named defendants.  Thus, the argument concludes, after the damages claims were dropped, there was no longer a case or controversy between plaintiffs and themselves.  We cannot agree with the Poulos defendants' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among its infirmities, this argument fails to recognize that plaintiffs sought from the Poulos defendants two forms of relief other than an injunction.  First, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Poulos defendants themselves, irrespective of their relationship with the CAR defendants, had violated, inter alia, the disclosure and use provisions of Title III and the Maine act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  And second, plaintiffs sought from the Poulos defendants the attorneys' fees they had incurred in the course of protecting their statutorily created rights.  Thus, even if we were to endorse for the sake of argument the dubious premise upon which the Poulos defendants' argument rests, we are still compelled to conclude that there was a very live case and controversy between plaintiffs and the Poulos defendants.  Accordingly, we reject the contention that plaintiffs' claims against the Poulos defendants were mooted when they dropped their damages claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Poulos's Knowledge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Poulos defendants next contend that the district court clearly erred when, in determining that they had violated the disclosure and use provisions of Title III, it found that Richard Poulos knew or had reason to know that the interceptions at issue had been effectuated in violation of Title III.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d), supra note 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> More particularly, they argue that the judge clearly erred in implicitly deciding that plaintiffs had met their burden of proving that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the statutory business extension and consent exceptions did not apply to the interceptions.  After carefully considering this argument, we are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that a person has not committed a disclosure or use violation under Title III unless s/he \"knew or had reason to know that the interception [by which the information which was disclosed or used had been obtained] itself was in violation of Title III.\"  United States v. Wuliger, 981 F.2d 1497, 1501 (10th Cir.1992);  see also Thompson v. Dulaney, 970 F.2d 744, 749 (10th Cir.1992).  In other words, \"knowledge or reason to know of the illegality is an element of the offense.\"  Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1501.   Thus, in a civil action, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"1) the information used or disclosed came from an intercepted communication, and 2) sufficient facts concerning the circumstances of the interception such that the defendant could, with presumed knowledge of the law, determine that the interception was prohibited in light of Title III.\"  Thompson, 970 F.2d at 749;  see also Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 199-200, 111 S.Ct. 604, 609-610, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991) (making clear that the common law presumption that every person knows the law ordinarily applies when courts construe criminal statutes).  This demonstration includes a showing that any statutory exceptions asserted by a defendant do not, in fact, apply.  See Thompson, 970 F.2d at 749.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we perceive no clear error in the district court's implicit findings that the statutory defenses did not apply.  Insofar as the Poulos defendants are challenging the court's finding regarding the business extension exception, we again observe that the exception applies only when, inter alia, the aural acquisition at issue is effectuated by means of a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a component thereof.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a),  supra at 279.  As noted earlier, we think it evident that the monitoring equipment used by the CAR defendants cannot be so characterized.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that Poulos misapprehended the nature of the equipment the CAR defendants used to monitor plaintiffs' calls.  Given these facts, we discern no basis for upsetting the court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the business extension exception would not apply to the intercepted calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, insofar as the Poulos defendants are contesting the court's finding regarding the consent exception, we again note that consent, even if implied, must be \" 'consent in fact.' \"   See Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 116-17 (quoting Amen, 831 F.2d at 378).   As observed earlier, there is record evidence tending to indicate that Dyer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> never was informed (1) of the manner in which the monitoring was being conducted;  and (2) that he himself would be subjected to such monitoring.  Moreover, there is record evidence from which a rational factfinder could have found, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that Poulos was not laboring under the assumption that Dyer had been so informed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Thus, we can discern no clear error in the district court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the consent exception would not apply to the intercepted calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the Poulos defendants' challenge to the court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the interceptions violated Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Poulos Defendants' Good Faith Defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Poulos defendants' next argument, that the good faith defense provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(d)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> exonerates them, is a variation on this same theme.  In essence, the Poulos defendants claim that Poulos, in good faith, believed that the business extension and consent exceptions applied and were \"statutory authorization[s]\" for the wiretapping that occurred.  Thus, they assert, they have a complete defense against plaintiffs' civil claims.  Again, we do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have stated, the district court sustainably found that Poulos disclosed and used the contents of intercepted communications despite, at the very least, having had reason to know that the interception was effectuated in violation of Title III.  Therefore, even if we assume arguendo that the term \"statutory authorization\" in Sec. 2520(d) encompasses the business extension and consent exceptions (a matter that we do not now decide), it is evident that any belief on Poulos's part that these exceptions did apply could have been premised only upon mistakes of law.  And, as we have held, nothing in Sec. 2520(d) supports a conclusion that the good faith defense applies where a defendant mistakenly believes that there exists a statutory authorization for the wiretapping.  See Campiti, 611 F.2d at 394-95 (mistaken belief that statutory exceptions apply does not give rise to a good faith defense);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> see also Heggy v. Heggy, 944 F.2d 1537, 1542 (10th Cir.1991) (Sec. 2520(d) does not embrace mistake of law), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1514, 117 L.Ed.2d 651 (1992).  Accordingly, we reject as meritless the Poulos defendants' argument that they are protected by the good faith defense of Sec. 2520(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. Entitlement to Jury Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in one sentence, the Poulos defendants assert:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Due to the professional implications, the exposure to substantial attorneys [sic] fees, the [district] court's decision to determine whether there was a use and disclosure violation under both [Title III] and the Maine Act, and the criminal nature of the statute involved, [the Poulos defendants] should have been accorded a jury trial on the issues of whether they used the tapes knowing or with reason to know of the illegality and the good-faith defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They do not, however, explain how the presence in this case of \"professional implications,\" an attorneys' fees request, use and disclosure issues, and the fact that Title III also contains criminal provisions renders this action an essentially legal one.  Nor do they cite to any authority from which we can derive such an inference.  As such, their argument is perfunctory and we will not address it.  See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 468.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Plaintiffs' Arguments</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Scope of the Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' primary argument on appeal is their complaint concerning the reach of the injunction issued by the district court.  The argument has three components:  (1) that the court abused its discretion in permitting defendants to disclose and/or use the intercepted recordings in Bowers;  (2) that the court also abused its discretion in failing to enjoin the Bowers litigation;  and (3) that the court erroneously thought itself restricted to the relief provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> when it issued the injunction.  We address each branch of plaintiffs' argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Disclosure and/or Use of the Recordings in Bowers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first aspect of plaintiffs' argument is not difficult to comprehend.  They contend that the court's injunction, insofar as it permits defendants to disclose and/or use the contents of the tapes for admissibility determinations in Bowers, must be reversed.  In plaintiffs' view, Title III<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> simply does not allow for any disclosures and/or use of illegally intercepted material in civil cases.  After careful consideration, we disagree with this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making their argument, plaintiffs rely upon the fact that Title III, without exception, makes criminal \"disclosures\" and/or \"uses\" of illegally intercepted material.  In our view, however, there are at least two reasons why the lack of any such explicit exception does not dictate the conclusion reached by plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">First, we think it important to note:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A statute is passed as a whole and not in parts or sections and is animated by one general purpose and intent.  Consequently, each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, Sec. 46.05, at 103 (5th ed. 1992).  Here, if we were to interpret the criminal provisions of Title III in the manner suggested by plaintiffs, we would render the statute unenforceable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  Thus, we must reject plaintiffs' interpretation as violative of a fundamental tenet of statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we think that Congress, in enacting Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, made clear its endorsement of disclosures and/or uses of illegally intercepted material for the adjudicatory purposes contemplated by the district court.  As noted, Sec. 2515 bans the introduction into evidence of both illegally intercepted material and any evidence derived therefrom.  Implicit in this ban, we believe, are two assumptions:  (1) that the intercepted material will be presented to a court or jury for an initial adjudication of whether it was acquired illegally;  and (2) that a court will thereafter determine whether other evidence was derived from the intercepted evidence.  Simply put, we are at a loss to see how these functions could be performed without the types of adjudicatory \"disclosures\" and/or \"uses\" that plaintiffs view as banned by Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the argument that the court erred in permitting future disclosures and/or uses of the recordings and transcriptions here at issue for the limited purpose of aiding it in the making of admissibility determinations in Bowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the court's injunction explicitly made reference only to disclosures and/or uses in the context of admissibility determinations, the parties also disagree over whether the tapes at issue can be used \"for purposes of impeachment\" in Bowers.   Because we believe that this is an important issue certain to arise during the course of that litigation, we address it at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the obvious.  As we have observed, Title III makes criminal the intentional disclosure and/or use of information obtained through unauthorized interceptions of wire, oral, or electronic communications (when the discloser/user knows or has reason to know that the interception was unauthorized).  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d), supra note 3;  see also Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 46, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 2360, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972).  It also generally reserves as a remedy to anyone subjected to an unlawful interception \"such ... equitable or declaratory relief as may be appropriate.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(b), supra note 5.  We think it apparent, therefore, that, in order to provide aggrieved plaintiffs with \"appropriate\" relief, courts ordinarily should completely enjoin persons in possession of illegally intercepted information from disclosing and/or using that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to how, if at all, illegally intercepted communications may be disclosed and/or used as evidence in court proceedings, Title III is more explicit.  As noted above, Sec. 2515 states that \"no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence....\"  See supra note 32.  Despite the unequivocal nature of this statutory language, however, several courts, including this one, have allowed the government to disclose and use the contents of illegally intercepted communications in order to impeach testifying criminal defendants.  See United States v. Vest, 813 F.2d 477, 484 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1154 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011, 103 S.Ct. 1249, 75 L.Ed.2d 479 (1983);  see also, e.g., United States v. Echavarria-Olarte, 904 F.2d 1391, 1397 (9th Cir.1990);  United States v. Caron, 474 F.2d 506, 508 (5th Cir.1973).  In so doing, these courts, either explicitly or implicitly, have relied upon a passage in the legislative history of Title III which indicates a congressional desire to incorporate, inter alia, the impeachment exception of \"search and seizure law\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> into the Title III calculus.  See generally Caron, 474 F.2d at 510 (interpreting the meaning of S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 96, reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2184-85).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every federal court that has passed on the question has, however, declined to extend this impeachment exception to civil actions brought under Title III.  See, e.g., Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506;  Anthony v. United States, 667 F.2d 870, 879 (10th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1133, 102 S.Ct. 2959, 73 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1982).  In so doing, these courts, have taken note of (1) the \"overriding concern for protection of privacy ... [Title III] sets out,\" Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506, and (2) the fact that Sec. 2515, by its terms, allows for no exceptions.  They, therefore, have proceeded from the premise that \" 'what is not permitted [by the Act] is forbidden.' \"  Id. (quoting Fultz v. Gilliam, 942 F.2d 396, 401 (6th Cir.1991)).  Then, these courts have observed that the allowance of an impeachment exception derives from the references in the legislative history to \"search and seizure law\" and the Supreme Court's decision in Walder.   See S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 96, reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2112, 2184.  Thus, because \"[n]ormal search and seizure laws have arisen in the context of the Fourth Amendment which is directed against the government, not against private individuals,\" Anthony, 667 F.2d at 879, and because the Fourth Amendment does not apply in civil actions not involving the government, see id., these courts have, as stated above, declined to recognize an impeachment exception to Sec. 2515 in civil proceedings, see id.;   see also Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this line of reasoning persuasive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> and accordingly limit the impeachment exception of Sec. 2515 to criminal actions brought pursuant to Title III.  Therefore, it follows that the illegal interceptions (and their transcriptions) at issue in this litigation cannot, pursuant to the criminal impeachment exception, be introduced into evidence for impeachment purposes in Bowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Failure to Enjoin Bowers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second component of plaintiffs' argument has two parts:  that, in failing to enjoin Bowers, the district court (1) erroneously relied upon Fourth Amendment \"independent source\" jurisprudence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and (2) erroneously overlooked the fact that Title III \"flatly\" bans disclosures and uses of illegally intercepted material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  In our view, plaintiffs misconstrue the approach taken by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' first claim, the court did not hold that the evidence derived from the illegal interceptions would be admissible in Bowers pursuant to the independent source rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Instead, the court found that \"the evidence presented at trial demonstrated the existence of information upon which the allegations in Bowers v. Allied could be based independent of the subject tapes.\"   Poulos II, slip op. at 29-30 (emphasis supplied).  In other words, the court found that evidence other than that which was on the tapes (and \"in no way attributable to the existence of the subject tapes,\" see id. at 30) could support the lawsuit.  Thus, the independent source rule, which is a means for admitting evidence springing from independent sources despite the fact that the evidence replicates tainted evidence, was not a basis for the district court's holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to plaintiffs' second claim, we believe it sufficient to state that the court's injunction does not contravene the purposes of Title III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a>  Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, Title III does not \"flatly\" ban all disclosures and uses of illegally intercepted communications.  Instead, as we have explained, it generally bans such disclosures and uses while, either explicitly or implicitly, allowing for certain exceptions (i.e., an impeachment exception in criminal cases, see supra at 287, and an \"adjudication\" exception, see supra at 286-87, in all cases).  In our view, the court's injunction is consistent with this statutory nuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' assertion that the court's failure to enjoin Bowers was infected by legal error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Erroneous Exclusive Reliance on Section 2515</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final facet of plaintiffs' argument, that the court erroneously thought itself restricted to the relief provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, when it declined to enjoin Bowers, does not require extended discussion.  While, as we shall discuss below, the court did reveal a somewhat cramped view of the scope of its equitable powers in denying plaintiffs' Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment, see infra at 289-90, the record clearly reveals that no such restrictive view impaired its treatment of plaintiffs' initial request for injunctive relief.  In fact, contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the court's injunction order explicitly states that the decision not to enjoin Bowers was based upon the evidence, and not upon a perceived lack of legal power to order the remedy requested.  See Poulos II, slip op. at 30 (\"The Court is satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is beyond the scope warranted by the evidence presented at trial.\")  (emphasis supplied).  Accordingly, we find this claim of legal error to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Motion to Amend Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred in denying their Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment.  In this motion, plaintiffs averred that they were seeking, inter alia, to \"clarify\" the court's previous injunction order.  In reality, however, as the district court noted, plaintiffs' motion actually sought (1) \"additional relief\" not requested at trial or in the amended complaint, and (2) evidentiary rulings in Bowers.   Because the court acted well within its discretion in denying this relief, we cannot agree with plaintiffs that the court erred in denying their motion.  Because, however, we do agree with plaintiffs that the court's denial order evinced a misunderstanding of (1) the scope of its powers, and (2) the requirements of Title III, we do pause, albeit briefly, to add a few caveats.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny a Rule 59 motion is committed to the wide discretion of the district court and must be respected absent abuse.  E.g., Fernandez v. Leonard, 963 F.2d 459, 468 (1st Cir.1992).  Of course, this discretion attaches to a court's decision on whether to allow a party to argue new material or a new theory under Rule 59.  See Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1055, 108 S.Ct. 2821, 100 L.Ed.2d 922 (1988);  but see FDIC v. Meyer, 781 F.2d 1260, 1268 (7th Cir.1986) (motion to alter or amend judgment \"cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment issued\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion sought relief not requested in their amended complaint.  For example, plaintiffs asked the court to order, inter alia, (1) that defendants \"turn over for seal or destruction every illegal tape and transcript, and any record of any sort containing any contents of illegal interceptions\";  (2) that the Poulos defendants and Daniel Lilley and his law firm<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> be enjoined from further participation in Bowers;  (3) that the aforementioned attorneys be prohibited from communicating with whatever attorney/s might replace them as counsel in Bowers;  (4) that the disclosure and/or use of depositions taken by Poulos be enjoined;  and (5) that defendants with exposure to the intercepted recordings be prohibited from testifying in Bowers.   In their complaint, however, plaintiffs requested no such relief as an alternative to the enjoining of Bowers.   Accordingly, insofar as the court denied plaintiffs' motion because the motion sought \"additional relief\", we cannot say that it abused its discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we are concerned about certain dicta contained in the district court's order.  In the course of denying plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion, the court indicated (1) that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, and (2) the independent source rule, see supra note 38, would constrain its rulings in Bowers.   We think that the court erred in so indicating.  First, we wish to emphasize that, as always, the court has broad discretion, through discovery orders, evidentiary rulings, and the like, in deciding how it will manage that trial.  See, e.g., Serrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., 985 F.2d 625, 628 (1st Cir.1993) (district court has broad discretion in managing litigation).  However, in Bowers, this discretion must be tempered by the court's obligation, flowing from the protections set forth in Title III and the Maine act, to ensure that the illegally intercepted material, and any evidence derived therefrom, not be disclosed or used in that proceeding (other than for the purposes we have already approved, see supra section III.B.1.a. of this opinion).  In our view, this discretion and concomitant obligation will require the court to consider the possibility of rulings that go beyond Sec. 2515, which is directed solely at evidence.  For example, in order to guard against the future use of the intercepted material, as the term use is generally understood, we believe that the court should consider matters such as (1) the disqualification of counsel, and (2) the prohibition of any communication between any disqualified counsel and replacement counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to our second point.  In making its rulings, the court should be aware that, as a general rule, Fourth Amendment doctrines like the independent source rule do not apply in private civil actions implicating Title III.  As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent unreasonable governmental intrusions into the privacy of one's person, house, papers, or effects.  The wrong condemned is the unjustified governmental invasion of these areas of an individual's private life.  That wrong ... is fully accomplished by the original search without probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 354, 94 S.Ct. 613, 623, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (allowing a grand jury witness to be asked questions based on evidence obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment, because such questions \"work no new Fourth Amendment wrong\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III, on the other hand, generally proscribes, inter alia, the disclosure and/or use of illegally intercepted material.  In other words, it prohibits more than just the initial wrongful invasion.  See Gelbard, 408 U.S. at 51-52, 92 S.Ct. at 2362-2363.   Thus, under Title III, the disclosure and/or use of information obtained through a wrongful invasion amounts to a separate injury prohibited by statute, and makes a person subjected to such a disclosure and/or use \"a victim, once again, of a federal crime.\"  Id. at 52, 92 S.Ct. at 2363 (ruling that grand jury witness may not be asked questions based on evidence obtained by illegal wiretapping).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the court did not abuse its considerable discretion in denying plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion.  However, in making discovery, evidentiary, or other rulings in Bowers, the court should not (1) assume that it is limited to the relief set forth in Sec. 2515, or (2) assume the applicability of judicially developed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Statutory Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' third argument is that the court erred in determining that the statutory damages provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(c), see supra note 5, are legal, rather than equitable, in nature.  Defendants respond that plaintiffs did not preserve this argument for appellate review.  We agree with defendants that this issue is not properly preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, see supra note 21, plaintiffs' original complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief;  actual, statutory, and punitive damages;  and attorneys' fees.  As the trial date approached, however, plaintiffs apparently determined that they did not wish to have a jury hear any portion of this case.  Accordingly, they amended their complaint so as to drop all but their statutory damages claims.  Then, in their final pretrial memorandum, plaintiffs stated:  \"If the Court should decide that statutory damages are a legal remedy so as to support the Defendants' jury demand, then the Allied Plaintiffs will dismiss their claim for statutory damages.\"   Subsequently, the court ruled that statutory damages are legal in nature.  Thus, plaintiffs further amended their complaint so as to omit their prayer for statutory damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs now seek to resurrect their statutory damages claim.  This they cannot do.  If plaintiffs wished to preserve this issue, they should have presented their case for statutory damages to a jury.  Cf., e.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (\" 'It is black letter law that it is a party's first obligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available in the district court before seeking it on appeal.' \")  (quoting Beaulieu v. IRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir.1989)).  If they were displeased with the results of the jury's deliberations, plaintiffs next could have asked the court to set the jury's determination aside.  If they still were not satisfied, plaintiffs then could have appealed the court's decision to commit the statutory damages question to the jury in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' approach to this issue, if endorsed, would undermine the efficient administration of justice.  Had plaintiffs presented their claim for statutory damages to a jury, and had they received the award they sought (either from the jury itself or from the court after a successful Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law), the need for an appeal on this point would have been obviated.  Moreover, even if plaintiffs had not received the relief they were seeking, the issues underlying the propriety of a statutory damage award would have been fully litigated at the same time as the other issues animating this litigation.  Thus, we would have been in a position, on a developed record, either to resolve the question ourselves or to remand for what would undoubtedly be a less involved process than the one plaintiffs now seek.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, when plaintiffs amended their complaint so as to drop their claim for statutory damages, they irrevocably waived their right thereto.  Accordingly, we need not reach the question of whether the court erred when it determined, prior to plaintiffs' final amendment, that statutory damages under Sec. 2520(c) are legal in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Disclosure and Use Violations by the CAR Defendants</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in one-half of one page of their fifty-one page brief, plaintiffs contend that the district court committed legal error in ruling that the CAR defendants did not violate the disclosure and use provisions of Title III and the Maine act.  The CAR defendants, utilizing just over three-quarters of one page of their forty-eight page brief, counter that any disclosures and uses on their part took place within the confines of the attorney-client relationship, and that such fact absolves them from liability under the relevant statutory provisions.  Plaintiffs, again using less than one-half of one page of their forty-eight page reply brief, characterize this argument as \"incomprehensible\" and restate their position that the CAR defendants committed disclosure and use violations.  Neither side, at any point, makes reference to any case law, statutory authority, or legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here adverted to is an interesting one on which no federal appeals court has yet spoken:  namely, do 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d) (and, correspondingly, 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(3)(A) and (B)), see supra note 3, which by their terms prohibit the \"disclos[ure] ... to any other person\" and the \"use\" of illegally intercepted material, make it a crime to disclose and use such material during the course of attorney consultations?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  Certainly, reasonable arguments might be made on both sides of this question of first impression.  And, in accordance with our usual practice, we do not wish to decide it without the benefit of such argumentation and a developed record.  Accordingly, we deem the issue to have been waived in this instance.

Thus, we confine our discussion in this section of the opinion to federal law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In support of its position that the CAR device should be so considered, defendants advance three arguments that are, at best, unpersuasive.  First, defendants assert that the record evidence demonstrates that the monitoring device was comprised of standard electronic components which are \"commonly used in telephone systems.\"   Upon close scrutiny, however, it is clear that this assertion is premised solely upon an outrageous mischaracterization of the testimony of Jonathan Broome.  Broome did not testify, as defendants suggest, that the components of the CAR system \"are commonly used in telephone systems.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Instead, he answered the question, \"So, these wires were not uncommon parts or components for use in various ways with the [sic] telephone systems, were they?\" by responding, \"No.  It was all--you don't usually use balanced shielded audio cable for telephone, but it is quite acceptable to.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  In other words, rather than testifying that the components are commonly used in telephone systems, Broome stated that, though it was unusual, the components could acceptably be used with telephone systems.  In our view, such testimony is not helpful to defendants</p>\n        <p>Second, defendants claim that certain 1986 amendments to the federal anti-wiretap statute were intended to broaden the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a) so as to include equipment such as the CAR monitoring device.  This argument flagrantly misconstrues the purpose of the congressional action.  The legislative history makes it apparent that the 1986 amendments were aimed at strengthening the statute by updating it to reflect nearly twenty years of telecommunications advances.  See generally S.Rep. No. 99-541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1-11, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555-65.  Despite defendants' contrary urgings, there is absolutely no evidence in this history suggesting that Congress meant to expand the parameters of the business extension exception so as to embrace almost all wiretapping equipment.</p>\n        <p>Finally, defendants seem to argue that the First Circuit, in Campiti, 611 F.2d at 392, read the \"any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof\" provision out of Sec. 2510(5)(a).  We think it sufficient to state without elaboration that Campiti, when fairly read in context, does no such thing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In their brief, the CAR defendants conclude their argument that the business extension exception applies with a very short equitable argument that their \"good faith\" reliance on the advice of others, including counsel, in installing the monitoring system should absolve them from liability.  They do not, however, adduce any authority in support of this novel proposition.  Moreover, in the course of rebuffing defendants' business extension exception argument, the district court supportably found that the interceptions here at issue were not effectuated to further the original purpose of the monitoring system.  Defendants do not, and cannot, seriously contest this finding.  Thus, the alleged good faith of the CAR defendants in originally installing the system is irrelevant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">15</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(d) provides:</p>\n        <p>It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where ... one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception....</p>\n        <p>Similarly, 15 M.R.S.A.

Specifically, Blakey would have testified, inter alia, (1) that the CAR defendants' monitoring equipment was not a \"device\" as defined by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a) or 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 709(3);  (2) that the monitoring equipment \"was telephone 'equipment or facility' \" [sic], see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a);  (3) that the monitoring at issue was done \"within the ordinary course of [CAR's] business,\" see id.;  (4) that the actions and activities of the Poulos defendants \"were carried out in a good faith reliance on a statutory authorization within the terms of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(d)\";  and (5) that \"under all the relevant facts and circumstances, attorneys in the position of the Poulos defendants ... would not have had 'reason to know' that the [intercepted] information was obtained in violation of law.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The court's decision rests upon especially firm ground with regard to Blakey.  The Poulos defendants' offer of proof, see supra note 19, reveals that virtually all of Blakey's testimony would have been opinion testimony regarding (1) the state of mind of the Poulos defendants, and (2) the applicability of certain statutory provisions to the facts of this case.  Leaving aside overall admissibility concerns, it is apparent that such testimony is not based upon \"scientific, technical, or ... specialized knowledge\" likely to be lacking in the able district judge who conducted this bench trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In their original complaint, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief;  actual, statutory, and punitive damages;  and attorneys' fees.  Eventually, however, plaintiffs amended their complaint so as to dismiss all their damages claims.  As a result, the case was reduced to a completely equitable proceeding tried only before the district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The part of Rule 65(d) upon which the Poulos defendants rely states:  \"Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order ... is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Despite the fact that it is specifically made available by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(b)(1), the Poulos defendants contend that such a declaration, standing alone, would be \"completely inappropriate\" because it would have no future application.  We are not persuaded by this argument.  The Poulos defendants are the attorneys of record for the CAR defendants in the Bowers litigation.  Surely a declaration that the Poulos defendants had disclosed and used the contents of intercepted communications, relevant to the Bowers lawsuit, in violation of Title III and the Maine act would be useful to plaintiffs in any motion they might file to disqualify the Poulos defendants in that case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The Poulos defendants also assert that the injunction issued against them was improper because plaintiffs were not in danger of suffering \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical' \" harm from them.  See Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (elaborating upon Article III's \"case or controversy\" requirement) (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1664-65, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)).  In light of the imminence of Bowers and the fact that the Poulos defendants may still participate in it, we find this line of argument entirely unconvincing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> In the course of so ruling, the court also found that the Poulos defendants had violated the disclosure and use provisions of the Maine act.  See 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(3)(A) and (B), supra note 3.  The Poulos defendants also contest this finding, arguing (1) that the Maine act required the court to find that they had disclosed and used the intercepted information \"actually knowing\" that it had been illegally obtained, and (2) that the evidence could not support such a finding.  This argument is built on a faulty legal foundation.  Section 710(3)(A) and (B) do not require knowledge that the information was illegally intercepted;  they merely require knowledge \"that the information was obtained through interception [as that term is defined by the Maine act].\"  See supra note 3.  Accordingly, because of its defective premise, and because a thorough review of the record convinces us that the court did not clearly err in implicitly finding that the Poulos defendants knew that the information they disclosed and used had been \"obtained through interception,\" we reject this argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> See supra note 17</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> For example, in response to a question at trial regarding a journal entry made by Dyer, Poulos testified:  \"You people didn't know about and Dyer didn't know about the wiretaps on August 25 or so and when he's talking about sue--[sic].\"  Also, when Poulos disclosed the contents of the tapes to counsel for CAR's Chapter 11 trustee, he informed them that the tapes might have been criminally obtained</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C.

At any rate, we deem it waived, see United States v.

While this argument has some force, we think, in light of (1) the unequivocal language of Sec. 2515, (2) the broad remedial purposes of Title III, and (3) the restrictions the Supreme Court has put on the impeachment exception, see supra note 35, that the exception we have read into Sec. 2515 must be strictly construed.  Cf. Vest, 813 F.2d at 480-84 (declining to read the legislative history at issue as empowering courts to read further exceptions into Sec. 2515).  As we have noted, the exception derives from a specific reference to \"search and seizure law\" and a citation to Walder, neither of which is directly applicable in the civil context.  Thus, any application of the exception to civil cases would be based upon extrapolation.  In light of the three above-stated factors which incline us towards a strict construction of the exception, we simply do not believe that such an extrapolation would be appropriate in this instance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> The independent source rule \"allows admission of evidence that has been discovered by means wholly independent of any constitutional violation.\"  Nix v.

Both the CAR defendants and the Poulos defendants challenge sundry factual findings and legal judgments, arguing essentially that their respective actions did not run afoul of Title III and the Maine anti-wiretap statute.  Plaintiffs' primary claim is that the court's injunction does not sufficiently remedy the harm they have suffered and are continuing to suffer.  After carefully reviewing the record and the parties' arguments, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following detailed recitation is derived from the factual findings made by the district court in conjunction with Allied's motion for preliminary injunctive relief, see Williams v. Poulos, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></span>, 868-72 (D.Me.1992) (\"Poulos I\"), and after the conclusion of the bench trial.  See Williams v. Poulos, Civ. No. 92-0069-B, slip op. at 3-10 (D.Me. February 4, 1993) (\"Poulos II \").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is but one in a series of civil lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings which can be traced to the collapse of CAR.  CAR was founded in 1988 in order to dismantle automobiles and resell used parts.  By May 1990, CAR employed approximately one hundred and forty people and operated throughout New England and in the Atlantic provinces of Canada.  Twenty people worked in CAR's East Vassalboro, Maine, headquarters, including Bowers, Rodrigue, and Robichaud, the CAR defendants.  These three owned 95% of CAR's stock and were members of CAR's Board of Directors (\"the Board\").  In addition, Bowers was CAR's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Treasurer, while Rodrigue served as CAR's President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To finance its early growth and operations, CAR developed a banking relationship with Casco Northern Bank.  In February 1990, Casco Northern refused to increase CAR's lines of credit.  As a result, CAR found itself in a serious financial bind because it had already spent the additional money it expected to receive.  Accordingly, CAR turned to Allied, a venture capital firm which had previously invested in it.  Allied responded with a large infusion of capital that raised its total investment in CAR to approximately $4,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this additional funding, CAR was unable to resolve its financial difficulties.  On May 29, 1990, Casco Northern declared CAR in default on its obligations.  Two days later, Allied followed suit.  On June 28, 1990, in an attempt to resolve the crisis, the CAR defendants entered into an agreement with Allied which came to be known as the \"Midnight Agreement.\"   Under its terms, Ralph A. Dyer was made CAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board, three representatives of Allied, plaintiffs George C. Williams, David Gladstone, and Frederick Russell, Jr., became members of the Board, and David Parker became an officer.  The Agreement also provided that the CAR defendants would remain on the Board, that Bowers would retain his position as Treasurer, and that Rodrigue would continue as President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, in May 1990, the CAR defendants had commissioned Michael Leighton, who owned Probe Investigating Service, Inc.  (\"Probe\"), to provide a system for electronically monitoring employee phone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The CAR defendants felt that a surveillance system was needed (1) to reduce CAR's telephone bills, and (2) decrease employee theft.  At the time they installed the system, the CAR defendants apparently received impromptu advice from Attorney Nicholas Lanzilotta that \"monitoring would not be illegal if notice was first given to the monitored employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After examining CAR's telephone system, Leighton concluded that he lacked the skill and expertise to create an appropriate monitoring system.  He therefore sought assistance from Jonathan Broome.  Broome's principal business was repairing consumer electronics;  he was not an authorized telephone system technician.  Although Broome considered the project to be unusual, Leighton assured him of its legality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 17, 1990, Broome, working after hours along with CAR security officer David Fisher, installed a custom-designed monitoring system<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in CAR's East Vassalboro headquarters.  In its findings of fact, the district court described the system as follows:The system ... consisted of small alligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one end and a \"punch-down\" at the other.  The wires to all the extension lines in CAR's offices were assembled on the punch-down.  Calls could be intercepted by attaching the alligator clips and microphone wire to a designated extension line on the punch-down.  The system could only monitor one extension at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The monitoring system designed by Broome also involved an interface connecting the microphone cable to a VCR and a video camera.  The VCR allowed the system to record calls for up to eight hours.  The video camera recorded the view meter on the VCR, allowing a person to fast forward the VCR tape until the meter indicated the presence of audio information.  The VCR, video camera and interface were mounted together on a plywood board and set up in an unused bathroom next to the area containing the punch-down.  Connecting wires were run through and over a suspended ceiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Poulos II, slip op. at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in June 1990, Rodrigue informed the managers at CAR that all telephone calls at CAR's offices would be subject to random monitoring and recording.  He also instructed the managers to inform their subordinates of the new monitoring policy.  At about the same time, Rodrigue directed employees to record long distance phone calls on provided telephone logs.  The employees were told that the logging system was to be used in conjunction with the monitoring system to reduce costs.  On June 29, 1990, Rodrigue told the new CEO, Dyer, that CAR had a system in place to deter employee phone abuse by randomly monitoring employee phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Fisher learned how to operate the monitoring system.  At first, he was instructed by the CAR defendants to monitor the extension lines randomly.  After a short time, however, the CAR defendants told him which lines to intercept.  Fisher was further instructed to deliver the tapes of recorded conversations to Wayne Bowers each day.  Bowers then made cassette tapes of those telephone conversations he wished to save.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 21, 1990, Fisher was instructed to monitor the telephone line of CAR Chief Financial Officer Richard Lee, who had been hired on Allied's recommendation.  Apparently, Rodrigue and Bowers doubted Lee's loyalty to CAR.  A few weeks later, however, the monitoring system was attached to the phone line of Jim Starr, an accountant from an outside firm who had been assigned to audit CAR.  The CAR defendants suspected that Starr was misusing the telephone system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same general time period, Dyer's relationship with the CAR defendants, which had been strained from the beginning, was rapidly deteriorating.  By July 10, 1990, Rodrigue and Robichaud were openly feuding with him.  On July 12, 1990, Dyer fired Rodrigue and Robichaud.  About a week after the firing, Dyer obtained a temporary restraining order barring Rodrigue and Robichaud from the CAR premises and prohibiting them from conducting any business on the company's behalf.  Meanwhile, on July 17 or 18, 1990, Dyer began occupying Starr's office and using Starr's telephone line.  Between July 18, 1990, and July 25, 1990, a number of Dyer's telephone calls were intercepted and recorded.  The CAR defendants admit that, by July 19, 1990, they were specifically targeting Dyer's conversations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, 1990, the CAR defendants met with attorneys Richard E. Poulos, John S. Campbell, and Paul F. Zendzian, the partners of Poulos, Campbell &amp; Zendzian, P.A., to discuss possible legal representation in matters involving CAR, Allied, and Dyer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> At that meeting, the existence of a tape containing recorded telephone conversations between Dyer and Allied employees and representatives was disclosed to the Poulos defendants.  The Poulos defendants made no inquiry into either how the tape was obtained or whether there was employee notice or consent.  They did, however, advise the CAR defendants to boycott a Board meeting that was scheduled for July 23, 1990.  That meeting, which was held telephonically so that the out-of-town Allied employees could participate, was taped by the CAR defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All monitoring and taping of telephone conversations at CAR's headquarters was discontinued on July 25, 1990.  On that same date, audio cassettes of some of the conversations that had been taped were delivered to the Poulos defendants, who soon thereafter agreed to represent the CAR defendants in the Bowers lawsuit.

Over the following six weeks, paralegals from the Poulos firm prepared transcripts of the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1990, pursuant to a certificate filed by Dyer with the United States Bankruptcy Court, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding was initiated on behalf of CAR.  Anthony Swenson was appointed Chapter 11 trustee for CAR on August 10, 1990.  On August 14, 1990, Swenson fired Dyer and rehired Bowers, Rodrigue, and Robichaud.  Subsequently, the bankruptcy proceeding was converted to Chapter 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early August 1990, Poulos asked Stuart W. Tisdale, an associate attorney in his office, to prepare a memorandum concerning the legality of intercepting wire communications.  In discussing the research assignment with Tisdale, Poulos stated that Dyer knew about the taping in question.  After reading Tisdale's memorandum, Poulos and Campbell were satisfied that at least some of the information from the tapes might be admissible as evidence or would be otherwise useful in the case against Allied.  In the district court's view, however, they did not \"follow through on their research on the issue of consent and the legality of the interceptions.\"   Poulos II, slip op. at 8.  Nor did they \"make an effort to determine directly whether Dyer and the other Allied employees whose conversations were intercepted knew of or consented to the monitoring.\"   Id.  Finally, the Poulos defendants \"did not consult with bar counsel or advise any court of the existence and use of the information derived from the telephone conversations.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3 and 4, 1990, Poulos read the transcripts of most of the recorded conversations that had been preserved.  On October 31, 1990, he disclosed contents of the tapes to Daniel Amory and David Crocker, counsel to the CAR Chapter 11 trustee.  In so doing, Poulos told Amory and Crocker that the tapes he possessed might have been criminally obtained.  He also asked them to keep the existence and contents of the tapes strictly confidential.  In November and December of 1990, Poulos again reviewed the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, October, and early November of 1990, the Poulos defendants obtained a large number of documents previously delivered by Allied to CAR's Chapter 11 trustee.  The documents were produced without any involvement of the Poulos defendants and without any connection to the existence of the taped telephone conversations.  These documents included notes, memoranda, and other written records of telephone conversations that had been taped on July 18, 19, 20, and 23, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, the CAR defendants filed the Bowers lawsuit, seeking $63,000,000 in damages from Allied, Dyer, and Leo Madden, a business associate of Dyer's.  After the complaint was filed, all discovery was stayed until December 5, 1991.  During January 1992, shortly after the discovery stay was lifted, Poulos took the depositions of Williams, Parker, Dyer, and Madden.  Poulos used both the discovery documents pertaining to the taped conversations and the tapes of the conversations themselves in preparing for the aforementioned depositions.  Following these depositions, Poulos revealed the existence of the tapes to counsel for Madden and Dyer.  In so doing, he (1) told counsel that the tapes proved that Madden and Dyer had lied during their depositions, and (2) offered to settle with them.  No settlement was reached between the parties, and the present lawsuit was filed by Allied on April 17, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the parties are challenging determinations made by the district court prior to and in conjunction with the bench trial, our standard of review is familiar.

In other words, we will give such findings effect unless, after carefully reading the record and according due deference to the trial court's superior ability to judge credibility, we form \" 'a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.' \"  Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457 (quoting Cumpiano v.

Thus, our role is to review only for an abuse of that discretion.  Taino, 982 F.2d at 24.

In addition, the Poulos defendants alone assert (1) that the court erred in ruling that plaintiffs' claims for equitable relief against them were not moot;  (2) that the court erred in determining that Poulos had acted with sufficient knowledge to have violated Title III and the Maine anti-wiretap statute;  (3) that the court erred in rejecting their claim that the statutory \"good faith\" defense relieved them of liability;  and (4) that the court erred in denying them a jury trial on these latter two issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' complaints essentially are (1) that the court made mistakes of law in fashioning equitable relief for the violations it found;  (2) that the court erred in denying their Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment;  (3) that the court erred in ruling that statutory damages under 18 U.S.C.

In fact, these statutes specifically delineate certain acquisitions that do not give rise to such liability.  Defendants argue that the district court erred in ruling that two of these defined exceptions--the business extension and consent exceptions--did not apply.  Our review, however, persuades us that the court's rulings are supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

Walonis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372783\"><a href=\"/opinion/372783/francesco-g-campiti-v-michael-a-walonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 392 (1st Cir.1979), places outside the reach of Title III the monitoring of communications carried out by certain types of equipment and done in the ordinary course of business.  It derives from 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(4) and (5).  Section 2510(4) defines the term \"interception\" as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Section 2510(5), insofar as is relevant, then defines \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" in the following manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) ... furnished by [a] subscriber or user for connection to the facilities of [a wire or electronic communication] service and used in the ordinary course of its business[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Thus, if the monitoring conducted by the CAR defendants had been effectuated by means of a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof\" which was both furnished by CAR for connection to the facilities of its communication service and used in the ordinary course of its business, defendants' actions would not constitute an interception and would be beyond the reach of Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the business extension exception did not apply for two reasons:  (1) because \"the subject conversations were intercepted and recorded by a device configured by someone other than a provider of electronic communication service\";  and (2) because \"a legitimate business purpose did not exist at the time the subject conversations were intercepted.\"   See Poulos II, slip op. at 17.  Perhaps recognizing the amount of deference owed to the court's resolution of this paradigmatic mixed question of law and fact, defendants do not expend a great amount of energy attacking the factual findings underpinning the court's conclusions.  Instead, they argue that the court's ruling was infected by erroneous legal reasoning.  More specifically, defendants assert that, with regard to its first stated reason, the court misapprehended the technical requirements of the statute, and, with regard to its second stated reason, the court misconstrued the term \"ordinary course of business.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendants that, in concluding that the business extension exception did not apply, the court erred in its reasoning.  Section 2510(5)(a) does not require that the acquisition device be configured by a provider of electronic communication service.  Nor does it direct courts to conduct an inquiry into whether a \"legitimate business purpose\" for monitoring exists at the time of the challenged aural acquisition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we believe the district court's ultimate determination, that the business extension exception does not apply, is sustainable.  Simply put, we are at a loss to see how the monitoring system used here, consisting as it did of \"alligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one end\" and an \"interface connecting [a] microphone cable to a VCR and a video camera\" on the other, can be considered to be a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a[ ] component thereof.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In so stating, we note that the CAR system is factually remote from the telephonic and telegraphic equipment courts have recognized as falling within the exception at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a).  See, e.g., Epps v.

Indeed, we think it self evident that the CAR system, far from being the type of exempt equipment contemplated by the authors of the business extension exception, is precisely the type of intercepting device Congress intended to regulate heavily when it enacted Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that it is not ordinarily the province of appellate courts to make findings of fact or to resolve, in the first instance, mixed questions of law and fact.  Yet, where only one resolution of a predominantly factbound question would, on a full record, be sustainable, courts of appeals can, and often should, decline to remand where there has been an error committed.

Here, given the trial court's findings regarding the nature of the monitoring device, the only sustainable ruling would be that the device was not a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a component thereof,\" and therefore not within the parameters of the business extension exception.  Accordingly, we reject the argument that defendants are protected by this exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

There was testimony tending to indicate that he was so informed, which the district judge apparently chose not to credit, and testimony tending to indicate that he was not.  In our view, the latter testimony, far from being incredible, was highly plausible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Thus, there is no basis for us to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Dyer was not told of the manner in which the monitoring was conducted and that he himself would be monitored.  Cf. Rodriguez-Morales, 931 F.2d at 982 (district court's finding should not be disturbed where there are two permissible views of the evidence).  And, without at least this minimal knowledge on the part of Dyer, we do not see how his consent in fact to the monitoring could be inferred from this record.  Cf. Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 117 (implied consent inferred where defendant was informed (1) that all incoming calls, (2) on a particular line, (3) would be tape recorded).

Our review of this record persuades us that the court acted well within its discretion in so concluding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Accordingly, we reject defendants' contention that the court erred in excluding Blakey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.

See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  In the Poulos defendants' view, the fact that they would be so bound, when combined with the fact that the trial was solely for equitable relief, means that complete relief could have been afforded to plaintiffs without their presence as named defendants.  Thus, the argument concludes, after the damages claims were dropped, there was no longer a case or controversy between plaintiffs and themselves.  We cannot agree with the Poulos defendants' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among its infirmities, this argument fails to recognize that plaintiffs sought from the Poulos defendants two forms of relief other than an injunction.  First, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Poulos defendants themselves, irrespective of their relationship with the CAR defendants, had violated, inter alia, the disclosure and use provisions of Title III and the Maine act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  And second, plaintiffs sought from the Poulos defendants the attorneys' fees they had incurred in the course of protecting their statutorily created rights.  Thus, even if we were to endorse for the sake of argument the dubious premise upon which the Poulos defendants' argument rests, we are still compelled to conclude that there was a very live case and controversy between plaintiffs and the Poulos defendants.  Accordingly, we reject the contention that plaintiffs' claims against the Poulos defendants were mooted when they dropped their damages claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Poulos's Knowledge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Poulos defendants next contend that the district court clearly erred when, in determining that they had violated the disclosure and use provisions of Title III, it found that Richard Poulos knew or had reason to know that the interceptions at issue had been effectuated in violation of Title III.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d), supra note 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> More particularly, they argue that the judge clearly erred in implicitly deciding that plaintiffs had met their burden of proving that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the statutory business extension and consent exceptions did not apply to the interceptions.  After carefully considering this argument, we are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that a person has not committed a disclosure or use violation under Title III unless s/he \"knew or had reason to know that the interception [by which the information which was disclosed or used had been obtained] itself was in violation of Title III.\"  United States v.

Thus, in a civil action, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"1) the information used or disclosed came from an intercepted communication, and 2) sufficient facts concerning the circumstances of the interception such that the defendant could, with presumed knowledge of the law, determine that the interception was prohibited in light of Title III.\"  Thompson, 970 F.2d at 749;  see also Cheek v.

Insofar as the Poulos defendants are challenging the court's finding regarding the business extension exception, we again observe that the exception applies only when, inter alia, the aural acquisition at issue is effectuated by means of a \"telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or a component thereof.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a),  supra at 279.  As noted earlier, we think it evident that the monitoring equipment used by the CAR defendants cannot be so characterized.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that Poulos misapprehended the nature of the equipment the CAR defendants used to monitor plaintiffs' calls.  Given these facts, we discern no basis for upsetting the court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the business extension exception would not apply to the intercepted calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, insofar as the Poulos defendants are contesting the court's finding regarding the consent exception, we again note that consent, even if implied, must be \" 'consent in fact.' \"   See Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 116-17 (quoting Amen, 831 F.2d at 378).   As observed earlier, there is record evidence tending to indicate that Dyer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> never was informed (1) of the manner in which the monitoring was being conducted;  and (2) that he himself would be subjected to such monitoring.  Moreover, there is record evidence from which a rational factfinder could have found, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that Poulos was not laboring under the assumption that Dyer had been so informed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Thus, we can discern no clear error in the district court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the consent exception would not apply to the intercepted calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the Poulos defendants' challenge to the court's finding that Poulos knew or had reason to know that the interceptions violated Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Poulos Defendants' Good Faith Defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Poulos defendants' next argument, that the good faith defense provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(d)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> exonerates them, is a variation on this same theme.  In essence, the Poulos defendants claim that Poulos, in good faith, believed that the business extension and consent exceptions applied and were \"statutory authorization[s]\" for the wiretapping that occurred.  Thus, they assert, they have a complete defense against plaintiffs' civil claims.  Again, we do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have stated, the district court sustainably found that Poulos disclosed and used the contents of intercepted communications despite, at the very least, having had reason to know that the interception was effectuated in violation of Title III.  Therefore, even if we assume arguendo that the term \"statutory authorization\" in Sec. 2520(d) encompasses the business extension and consent exceptions (a matter that we do not now decide), it is evident that any belief on Poulos's part that these exceptions did apply could have been premised only upon mistakes of law.  And, as we have held, nothing in Sec. 2520(d) supports a conclusion that the good faith defense applies where a defendant mistakenly believes that there exists a statutory authorization for the wiretapping.  See Campiti, 611 F.2d at 394-95 (mistaken belief that statutory exceptions apply does not give rise to a good faith defense);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> see also Heggy v.

Entitlement to Jury Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in one sentence, the Poulos defendants assert:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Due to the professional implications, the exposure to substantial attorneys [sic] fees, the [district] court's decision to determine whether there was a use and disclosure violation under both [Title III] and the Maine Act, and the criminal nature of the statute involved, [the Poulos defendants] should have been accorded a jury trial on the issues of whether they used the tapes knowing or with reason to know of the illegality and the good-faith defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They do not, however, explain how the presence in this case of \"professional implications,\" an attorneys' fees request, use and disclosure issues, and the fact that Title III also contains criminal provisions renders this action an essentially legal one.  Nor do they cite to any authority from which we can derive such an inference.  As such, their argument is perfunctory and we will not address it.  See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 468.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Plaintiffs' Arguments</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Scope of the Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' primary argument on appeal is their complaint concerning the reach of the injunction issued by the district court.  The argument has three components:  (1) that the court abused its discretion in permitting defendants to disclose and/or use the intercepted recordings in Bowers;  (2) that the court also abused its discretion in failing to enjoin the Bowers litigation;  and (3) that the court erroneously thought itself restricted to the relief provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> when it issued the injunction.  We address each branch of plaintiffs' argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Disclosure and/or Use of the Recordings in Bowers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first aspect of plaintiffs' argument is not difficult to comprehend.  They contend that the court's injunction, insofar as it permits defendants to disclose and/or use the contents of the tapes for admissibility determinations in Bowers, must be reversed.  In plaintiffs' view, Title III<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> simply does not allow for any disclosures and/or use of illegally intercepted material in civil cases.  After careful consideration, we disagree with this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making their argument, plaintiffs rely upon the fact that Title III, without exception, makes criminal \"disclosures\" and/or \"uses\" of illegally intercepted material.  In our view, however, there are at least two reasons why the lack of any such explicit exception does not dictate the conclusion reached by plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">First, we think it important to note:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A statute is passed as a whole and not in parts or sections and is animated by one general purpose and intent.  Consequently, each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, Sec. 46.05, at 103 (5th ed. 1992).  Here, if we were to interpret the criminal provisions of Title III in the manner suggested by plaintiffs, we would render the statute unenforceable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  Thus, we must reject plaintiffs' interpretation as violative of a fundamental tenet of statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we think that Congress, in enacting Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, made clear its endorsement of disclosures and/or uses of illegally intercepted material for the adjudicatory purposes contemplated by the district court.  As noted, Sec. 2515 bans the introduction into evidence of both illegally intercepted material and any evidence derived therefrom.  Implicit in this ban, we believe, are two assumptions:  (1) that the intercepted material will be presented to a court or jury for an initial adjudication of whether it was acquired illegally;  and (2) that a court will thereafter determine whether other evidence was derived from the intercepted evidence.  Simply put, we are at a loss to see how these functions could be performed without the types of adjudicatory \"disclosures\" and/or \"uses\" that plaintiffs view as banned by Title III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the argument that the court erred in permitting future disclosures and/or uses of the recordings and transcriptions here at issue for the limited purpose of aiding it in the making of admissibility determinations in Bowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the court's injunction explicitly made reference only to disclosures and/or uses in the context of admissibility determinations, the parties also disagree over whether the tapes at issue can be used \"for purposes of impeachment\" in Bowers.   Because we believe that this is an important issue certain to arise during the course of that litigation, we address it at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the obvious.  As we have observed, Title III makes criminal the intentional disclosure and/or use of information obtained through unauthorized interceptions of wire, oral, or electronic communications (when the discloser/user knows or has reason to know that the interception was unauthorized).  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d), supra note 3;  see also Gelbard v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108596\"><a href=\"/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108596\"><a href=\"/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span> (1972).  It also generally reserves as a remedy to anyone subjected to an unlawful interception \"such ... equitable or declaratory relief as may be appropriate.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(b), supra note 5.  We think it apparent, therefore, that, in order to provide aggrieved plaintiffs with \"appropriate\" relief, courts ordinarily should completely enjoin persons in possession of illegally intercepted information from disclosing and/or using that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to how, if at all, illegally intercepted communications may be disclosed and/or used as evidence in court proceedings, Title III is more explicit.  As noted above, Sec. 2515 states that \"no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence....\"  See supra note 32.  Despite the unequivocal nature of this statutory language, however, several courts, including this one, have allowed the government to disclose and use the contents of illegally intercepted communications in order to impeach testifying criminal defendants.

In so doing, these courts, either explicitly or implicitly, have relied upon a passage in the legislative history of Title III which indicates a congressional desire to incorporate, inter alia, the impeachment exception of \"search and seizure law\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> into the Title III calculus.

No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 96, reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2184-85).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every federal court that has passed on the question has, however, declined to extend this impeachment exception to civil actions brought under Title III.  See, e.g., Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506;  Anthony v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398317\"><a href=\"/opinion/398317/jack-holland-anthony-v-united-states-of-america-jack-holland-anthony-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, 879 (10th Cir.1981), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1133</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></span> (1982).  In so doing, these courts, have taken note of (1) the \"overriding concern for protection of privacy ... [Title III] sets out,\" Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506, and (2) the fact that Sec. 2515, by its terms, allows for no exceptions.  They, therefore, have proceeded from the premise that \" 'what is not permitted [by the Act] is forbidden.' \"  Id. (quoting Fultz v. Gilliam, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566852\"><a href=\"/opinion/566852/joyce-m-fultz-v-larry-edward-gilliam/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 401 (6th Cir.1991)).  Then, these courts have observed that the allowance of an impeachment exception derives from the references in the legislative history to \"search and seizure law\" and the Supreme Court's decision in Walder.   See S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 96, reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2112, 2184.  Thus, because \"[n]ormal search and seizure laws have arisen in the context of the Fourth Amendment which is directed against the government, not against private individuals,\" Anthony, 667 F.2d at 879, and because the Fourth Amendment does not apply in civil actions not involving the government, see id., these courts have, as stated above, declined to recognize an impeachment exception to Sec. 2515 in civil proceedings, see id.;   see also Wuliger, 981 F.2d at 1506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this line of reasoning persuasive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> and accordingly limit the impeachment exception of Sec. 2515 to criminal actions brought pursuant to Title III.  Therefore, it follows that the illegal interceptions (and their transcriptions) at issue in this litigation cannot, pursuant to the criminal impeachment exception, be introduced into evidence for impeachment purposes in Bowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Failure to Enjoin Bowers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second component of plaintiffs' argument has two parts:  that, in failing to enjoin Bowers, the district court (1) erroneously relied upon Fourth Amendment \"independent source\" jurisprudence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and (2) erroneously overlooked the fact that Title III \"flatly\" bans disclosures and uses of illegally intercepted material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  In our view, plaintiffs misconstrue the approach taken by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' first claim, the court did not hold that the evidence derived from the illegal interceptions would be admissible in Bowers pursuant to the independent source rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Instead, the court found that \"the evidence presented at trial demonstrated the existence of information upon which the allegations in Bowers v. Allied could be based independent of the subject tapes.\"   Poulos II, slip op. at 29-30 (emphasis supplied).  In other words, the court found that evidence other than that which was on the tapes (and \"in no way attributable to the existence of the subject tapes,\" see id. at 30) could support the lawsuit.  Thus, the independent source rule, which is a means for admitting evidence springing from independent sources despite the fact that the evidence replicates tainted evidence, was not a basis for the district court's holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to plaintiffs' second claim, we believe it sufficient to state that the court's injunction does not contravene the purposes of Title III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a>  Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, Title III does not \"flatly\" ban all disclosures and uses of illegally intercepted communications.  Instead, as we have explained, it generally bans such disclosures and uses while, either explicitly or implicitly, allowing for certain exceptions (i.e., an impeachment exception in criminal cases, see supra at 287, and an \"adjudication\" exception, see supra at 286-87, in all cases).  In our view, the court's injunction is consistent with this statutory nuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' assertion that the court's failure to enjoin Bowers was infected by legal error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Erroneous Exclusive Reliance on Section 2515</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final facet of plaintiffs' argument, that the court erroneously thought itself restricted to the relief provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, when it declined to enjoin Bowers, does not require extended discussion.  While, as we shall discuss below, the court did reveal a somewhat cramped view of the scope of its equitable powers in denying plaintiffs' Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment, see infra at 289-90, the record clearly reveals that no such restrictive view impaired its treatment of plaintiffs' initial request for injunctive relief.  In fact, contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the court's injunction order explicitly states that the decision not to enjoin Bowers was based upon the evidence, and not upon a perceived lack of legal power to order the remedy requested.  See Poulos II, slip op. at 30 (\"The Court is satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is beyond the scope warranted by the evidence presented at trial.\")  (emphasis supplied).  Accordingly, we find this claim of legal error to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Motion to Amend Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred in denying their Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to amend judgment.  In this motion, plaintiffs averred that they were seeking, inter alia, to \"clarify\" the court's previous injunction order.  In reality, however, as the district court noted, plaintiffs' motion actually sought (1) \"additional relief\" not requested at trial or in the amended complaint, and (2) evidentiary rulings in Bowers.   Because the court acted well within its discretion in denying this relief, we cannot agree with plaintiffs that the court erred in denying their motion.  Because, however, we do agree with plaintiffs that the court's denial order evinced a misunderstanding of (1) the scope of its powers, and (2) the requirements of Title III, we do pause, albeit briefly, to add a few caveats.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny a Rule 59 motion is committed to the wide discretion of the district court and must be respected absent abuse.  E.g., Fernandez v. Leonard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583332\"><a href=\"/opinion/583332/oscar-j-fernandez-v-francis-t-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 468 (1st Cir.1992).  Of course, this discretion attaches to a court's decision on whether to allow a party to argue new material or a new theory under Rule 59.  See Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495473\"><a href=\"/opinion/495473/application-for-issuance-of-order-requiring-the-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></span> (1988);  but see FDIC v. Meyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463527\"><a href=\"/opinion/463527/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-in-its-corporate-capacity-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span>, 1268 (7th Cir.1986) (motion to alter or amend judgment \"cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment issued\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion sought relief not requested in their amended complaint.  For example, plaintiffs asked the court to order, inter alia, (1) that defendants \"turn over for seal or destruction every illegal tape and transcript, and any record of any sort containing any contents of illegal interceptions\";  (2) that the Poulos defendants and Daniel Lilley and his law firm<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> be enjoined from further participation in Bowers;  (3) that the aforementioned attorneys be prohibited from communicating with whatever attorney/s might replace them as counsel in Bowers;  (4) that the disclosure and/or use of depositions taken by Poulos be enjoined;  and (5) that defendants with exposure to the intercepted recordings be prohibited from testifying in Bowers.   In their complaint, however, plaintiffs requested no such relief as an alternative to the enjoining of Bowers.   Accordingly, insofar as the court denied plaintiffs' motion because the motion sought \"additional relief\", we cannot say that it abused its discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we are concerned about certain dicta contained in the district court's order.  In the course of denying plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion, the court indicated (1) that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, see supra note 32, and (2) the independent source rule, see supra note 38, would constrain its rulings in Bowers.   We think that the court erred in so indicating.  First, we wish to emphasize that, as always, the court has broad discretion, through discovery orders, evidentiary rulings, and the like, in deciding how it will manage that trial.  See, e.g., Serrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600259\"><a href=\"/opinion/600259/alfonso-serrano-perez-and-luz-de-diego-rios-v-fmc-corporation-monsanto/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 628 (1st Cir.1993) (district court has broad discretion in managing litigation).  However, in Bowers, this discretion must be tempered by the court's obligation, flowing from the protections set forth in Title III and the Maine act, to ensure that the illegally intercepted material, and any evidence derived therefrom, not be disclosed or used in that proceeding (other than for the purposes we have already approved, see supra section III.B.1.a. of this opinion).  In our view, this discretion and concomitant obligation will require the court to consider the possibility of rulings that go beyond Sec. 2515, which is directed solely at evidence.  For example, in order to guard against the future use of the intercepted material, as the term use is generally understood, we believe that the court should consider matters such as (1) the disqualification of counsel, and (2) the prohibition of any communication between any disqualified counsel and replacement counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to our second point.  In making its rulings, the court should be aware that, as a general rule, Fourth Amendment doctrines like the independent source rule do not apply in private civil actions implicating Title III.  As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent unreasonable governmental intrusions into the privacy of one's person, house, papers, or effects.  The wrong condemned is the unjustified governmental invasion of these areas of an individual's private life.  That wrong ... is fully accomplished by the original search without probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Calandra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108898\"><a href=\"/opinion/108898/united-states-v-calandra/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 354, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108898\"><a href=\"/opinion/108898/united-states-v-calandra/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span> (1974) (allowing a grand jury witness to be asked questions based on evidence obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment, because such questions \"work no new Fourth Amendment wrong\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III, on the other hand, generally proscribes, inter alia, the disclosure and/or use of illegally intercepted material.  In other words, it prohibits more than just the initial wrongful invasion.  See Gelbard, 408 U.S. at 51-52, 92 S.Ct. at 2362-2363.   Thus, under Title III, the disclosure and/or use of information obtained through a wrongful invasion amounts to a separate injury prohibited by statute, and makes a person subjected to such a disclosure and/or use \"a victim, once again, of a federal crime.\"  Id. at 52, 92 S.Ct. at 2363 (ruling that grand jury witness may not be asked questions based on evidence obtained by illegal wiretapping).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the court did not abuse its considerable discretion in denying plaintiffs' Rule 59 motion.  However, in making discovery, evidentiary, or other rulings in Bowers, the court should not (1) assume that it is limited to the relief set forth in Sec. 2515, or (2) assume the applicability of judicially developed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Statutory Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' third argument is that the court erred in determining that the statutory damages provided for in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(c), see supra note 5, are legal, rather than equitable, in nature.  Defendants respond that plaintiffs did not preserve this argument for appellate review.  We agree with defendants that this issue is not properly preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, see supra note 21, plaintiffs' original complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief;  actual, statutory, and punitive damages;  and attorneys' fees.  As the trial date approached, however, plaintiffs apparently determined that they did not wish to have a jury hear any portion of this case.  Accordingly, they amended their complaint so as to drop all but their statutory damages claims.  Then, in their final pretrial memorandum, plaintiffs stated:  \"If the Court should decide that statutory damages are a legal remedy so as to support the Defendants' jury demand, then the Allied Plaintiffs will dismiss their claim for statutory damages.\"   Subsequently, the court ruled that statutory damages are legal in nature.  Thus, plaintiffs further amended their complaint so as to omit their prayer for statutory damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs now seek to resurrect their statutory damages claim.  This they cannot do.  If plaintiffs wished to preserve this issue, they should have presented their case for statutory damages to a jury.  Cf., e.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571252\"><a href=\"/opinion/571252/michael-j-foley-v-city-of-lowell-massachusetts-michael-j-foley-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (\" 'It is black letter law that it is a party's first obligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available in the district court before seeking it on appeal.' \")  (quoting Beaulieu v. IRS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517428\"><a href=\"/opinion/517428/janet-a-beaulieu-v-united-states-of-america-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1351</span></a></span>, 1352 (1st Cir.1989)).  If they were displeased with the results of the jury's deliberations, plaintiffs next could have asked the court to set the jury's determination aside.  If they still were not satisfied, plaintiffs then could have appealed the court's decision to commit the statutory damages question to the jury in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' approach to this issue, if endorsed, would undermine the efficient administration of justice.  Had plaintiffs presented their claim for statutory damages to a jury, and had they received the award they sought (either from the jury itself or from the court after a successful Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law), the need for an appeal on this point would have been obviated.  Moreover, even if plaintiffs had not received the relief they were seeking, the issues underlying the propriety of a statutory damage award would have been fully litigated at the same time as the other issues animating this litigation.  Thus, we would have been in a position, on a developed record, either to resolve the question ourselves or to remand for what would undoubtedly be a less involved process than the one plaintiffs now seek.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, when plaintiffs amended their complaint so as to drop their claim for statutory damages, they irrevocably waived their right thereto.  Accordingly, we need not reach the question of whether the court erred when it determined, prior to plaintiffs' final amendment, that statutory damages under Sec. 2520(c) are legal in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Disclosure and Use Violations by the CAR Defendants</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in one-half of one page of their fifty-one page brief, plaintiffs contend that the district court committed legal error in ruling that the CAR defendants did not violate the disclosure and use provisions of Title III and the Maine act.  The CAR defendants, utilizing just over three-quarters of one page of their forty-eight page brief, counter that any disclosures and uses on their part took place within the confines of the attorney-client relationship, and that such fact absolves them from liability under the relevant statutory provisions.  Plaintiffs, again using less than one-half of one page of their forty-eight page reply brief, characterize this argument as \"incomprehensible\" and restate their position that the CAR defendants committed disclosure and use violations.  Neither side, at any point, makes reference to any case law, statutory authority, or legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here adverted to is an interesting one on which no federal appeals court has yet spoken:  namely, do 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(1)(c) and (d) (and, correspondingly, 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(3)(A) and (B)), see supra note 3, which by their terms prohibit the \"disclos[ure] ... to any other person\" and the \"use\" of illegally intercepted material, make it a crime to disclose and use such material during the course of attorney consultations?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  Certainly, reasonable arguments might be made on both sides of this question of first impression.  And, in accordance with our usual practice, we do not wish to decide it without the benefit of such argumentation and a developed record.  Accordingly, we deem the issue to have been waived in this instance.

First, defendants assert that the record evidence demonstrates that the monitoring device was comprised of standard electronic components which are \"commonly used in telephone systems.\"   Upon close scrutiny, however, it is clear that this assertion is premised solely upon an outrageous mischaracterization of the testimony of Jonathan Broome.  Broome did not testify, as defendants suggest, that the components of the CAR system \"are commonly used in telephone systems.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Instead, he answered the question, \"So, these wires were not uncommon parts or components for use in various ways with the [sic] telephone systems, were they?\" by responding, \"No.  It was all--you don't usually use balanced shielded audio cable for telephone, but it is quite acceptable to.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  In other words, rather than testifying that the components are commonly used in telephone systems, Broome stated that, though it was unusual, the components could acceptably be used with telephone systems.  In our view, such testimony is not helpful to defendants</p>\n        <p>Second, defendants claim that certain 1986 amendments to the federal anti-wiretap statute were intended to broaden the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a) so as to include equipment such as the CAR monitoring device.  This argument flagrantly misconstrues the purpose of the congressional action.  The legislative history makes it apparent that the 1986 amendments were aimed at strengthening the statute by updating it to reflect nearly twenty years of telecommunications advances.  See generally S.Rep. No. 99-541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1-11, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555-65.  Despite defendants' contrary urgings, there is absolutely no evidence in this history suggesting that Congress meant to expand the parameters of the business extension exception so as to embrace almost all wiretapping equipment.</p>\n        <p>Finally, defendants seem to argue that the First Circuit, in Campiti, 611 F.2d at 392, read the \"any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof\" provision out of Sec. 2510(5)(a).  We think it sufficient to state without elaboration that Campiti, when fairly read in context, does no such thing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In their brief, the CAR defendants conclude their argument that the business extension exception applies with a very short equitable argument that their \"good faith\" reliance on the advice of others, including counsel, in installing the monitoring system should absolve them from liability.  They do not, however, adduce any authority in support of this novel proposition.  Moreover, in the course of rebuffing defendants' business extension exception argument, the district court supportably found that the interceptions here at issue were not effectuated to further the original purpose of the monitoring system.  Defendants do not, and cannot, seriously contest this finding.  Thus, the alleged good faith of the CAR defendants in originally installing the system is irrelevant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">15</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(d) provides:</p>\n        <p>It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where ... one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception....</p>\n        <p>Similarly, 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 709(4)(C) excludes from the reach of the statute those interceptors \"given prior authority by the sender or receiver.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Because the \"consent\" standard under Title III is certainly no more stringent than the \"prior authority\" standard set forth in 15 M.R.S.A.

Specifically, Blakey would have testified, inter alia, (1) that the CAR defendants' monitoring equipment was not a \"device\" as defined by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a) or 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 709(3);  (2) that the monitoring equipment \"was telephone 'equipment or facility' \" [sic], see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(5)(a);  (3) that the monitoring at issue was done \"within the ordinary course of [CAR's] business,\" see id.;  (4) that the actions and activities of the Poulos defendants \"were carried out in a good faith reliance on a statutory authorization within the terms of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(d)\";  and (5) that \"under all the relevant facts and circumstances, attorneys in the position of the Poulos defendants ... would not have had 'reason to know' that the [intercepted] information was obtained in violation of law.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The court's decision rests upon especially firm ground with regard to Blakey.  The Poulos defendants' offer of proof, see supra note 19, reveals that virtually all of Blakey's testimony would have been opinion testimony regarding (1) the state of mind of the Poulos defendants, and (2) the applicability of certain statutory provisions to the facts of this case.  Leaving aside overall admissibility concerns, it is apparent that such testimony is not based upon \"scientific, technical, or ... specialized knowledge\" likely to be lacking in the able district judge who conducted this bench trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In their original complaint, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief;  actual, statutory, and punitive damages;  and attorneys' fees.  Eventually, however, plaintiffs amended their complaint so as to dismiss all their damages claims.  As a result, the case was reduced to a completely equitable proceeding tried only before the district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The part of Rule 65(d) upon which the Poulos defendants rely states:  \"Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order ... is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Despite the fact that it is specifically made available by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(b)(1), the Poulos defendants contend that such a declaration, standing alone, would be \"completely inappropriate\" because it would have no future application.  We are not persuaded by this argument.  The Poulos defendants are the attorneys of record for the CAR defendants in the Bowers litigation.  Surely a declaration that the Poulos defendants had disclosed and used the contents of intercepted communications, relevant to the Bowers lawsuit, in violation of Title III and the Maine act would be useful to plaintiffs in any motion they might file to disqualify the Poulos defendants in that case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The Poulos defendants also assert that the injunction issued against them was improper because plaintiffs were not in danger of suffering \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical' \" harm from them.

In light of the imminence of Bowers and the fact that the Poulos defendants may still participate in it, we find this line of argument entirely unconvincing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> In the course of so ruling, the court also found that the Poulos defendants had violated the disclosure and use provisions of the Maine act.  See 15 M.R.S.A. Sec. 710(3)(A) and (B), supra note 3.  The Poulos defendants also contest this finding, arguing (1) that the Maine act required the court to find that they had disclosed and used the intercepted information \"actually knowing\" that it had been illegally obtained, and (2) that the evidence could not support such a finding.  This argument is built on a faulty legal foundation.  Section 710(3)(A) and (B) do not require knowledge that the information was illegally intercepted;  they merely require knowledge \"that the information was obtained through interception [as that term is defined by the Maine act].\"  See supra note 3.  Accordingly, because of its defective premise, and because a thorough review of the record convinces us that the court did not clearly err in implicitly finding that the Poulos defendants knew that the information they disclosed and used had been \"obtained through interception,\" we reject this argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> See supra note 17</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> For example, in response to a question at trial regarding a journal entry made by Dyer, Poulos testified:  \"You people didn't know about and Dyer didn't know about the wiretaps on August 25 or so and when he's talking about sue--[sic].\"  Also, when Poulos disclosed the contents of the tapes to counsel for CAR's Chapter 11 trustee, he informed them that the tapes might have been criminally obtained</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2520(d) states:  \"A good faith reliance on ... a statutory authorization ... is a complete defense against any civil or criminal action brought under this chapter or any other law.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The Poulos defendants point out that the term \"statutory authorization\" was added to Sec. 2520(d) after Campiti was handed down and assert, without any elaboration, that this means that Sec. 2520(d) \"may in fact now exempt a mistake of law.\"   Given the dearth of contexts where subjective mistakes of law allow a defendant to avoid liability, see Cheek, 498 U.S. at 199-200, 111 S.Ct. at 609-610, we find this perfunctorily made argument to be highly suspect.

See supra note 35</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> In an attempt to counteract this authority, the Poulos defendants contend (1) that Walder and its progeny do not explicitly state that the impeachment exception should be available only in criminal cases, and (2) that the concerns underlying the exception (e.g., the prevention of untruthful testimony) are equally applicable in the civil context.  While this argument has some force, we think, in light of (1) the unequivocal language of Sec. 2515, (2) the broad remedial purposes of Title III, and (3) the restrictions the Supreme Court has put on the impeachment exception, see supra note 35, that the exception we have read into Sec. 2515 must be strictly construed.  Cf. Vest, 813 F.2d at 480-84 (declining to read the legislative history at issue as empowering courts to read further exceptions into Sec. 2515).  As we have noted, the exception derives from a specific reference to \"search and seizure law\" and a citation to Walder, neither of which is directly applicable in the civil context.  Thus, any application of the exception to civil cases would be based upon extrapolation.  In light of the three above-stated factors which incline us towards a strict construction of the exception, we simply do not believe that such an extrapolation would be appropriate in this instance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> The independent source rule \"allows admission of evidence that has been discovered by means wholly independent of any constitutional violation.\"  Nix v.

If, however, there is independent evidence upon which the allegations of Bowers are premised, and if, as we shall explicitly urge it to do, see infra at 289-90, the district court takes pains to ensure that the contents of the illegally intercepted conversations, and any evidence derived therefrom, are not used or disclosed in the course of that litigation (other than in the course of making admissibility determinations), we do not believe that plaintiffs' concern will come to fruition</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> Mr. Lilley has represented the CAR defendants throughout this litigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn43\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43_ref\">43</a>\n        <p> Similarly, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in deferring the making of evidentiary rulings in Bowers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn44\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44_ref\">44</a>\n        <p> At least one federal judge, recognizing the inherent tension between the wording of the statute and the need for effective trial preparation, has held that the disclosure of the contents of intercepted recordings to counsel, for the purpose of preparing a defense, is not a crime.
