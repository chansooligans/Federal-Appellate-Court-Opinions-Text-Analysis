We have carefully reviewed the  record\n                    \n\nand   conclude   that  substantial   evidence   supports  the\n\nSecretary's determination that claimant was not disabled when\n\nhis insured  status expired,  and that  he retained,  at that\n\ntime, the  physical and mental abilities to  perform a narrow\n\nrange of  light, unskilled jobs  such as those  enumerated by\n\nthe Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").  We have considered all\n\nof  claimant's arguments  and,  finding  them without  merit,\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court  essentially on the\n\nbasis of  the magistrate-judge's  report  as adopted  by  the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          We add these  comments.  Claimant  argues that  the\n\nhypothetical posed  to the  vocational  expert was  defective\n\nbecause it  did not include a  non-exertional impairment that\n\nthe ALJ ultimately  found the claimant to  possess, namely an\n\ninability to  perform frequent stooping and  bending.  First,\n                              \n\nlight  jobs  require,  at  most, only  occasional  stooping.1\n\nFrustaglia v. Secretary of  HHS, 829 F.2d 192, 195  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1987).  If a person can do some stooping and  bending, which,\n\nby implication,  the ALJ found here,  the \"light occupational\n\nbase is  virtually intact.\"    Id. (quoting  Social  Security\n                                  \n\nRuling 85-15).   The narrowed  list of light-work  jobs which\n\nthe ALJ found  claimant could  perform are a  sub-set of  the\n\nlight  occupational  base  which  does not  involve  frequent\n\nstooping.  Cf. Social Security 85-15 (most medium,  heavy and\n              \n\n                    \n\n1.   Stooping  is  considered  the  least  strenuous  of  the\nbending  postures, and  involves  bending the  body from  the\nwaist downward and forward.  Social Security Ruling 85-15.  \n\nvery  heavy jobs  require the  ability to  stoop frequently).\n\nThus, the  frequent stooping restriction has  little, if any,\n\nrelevance to the light occupational base.\n\n          Second, since claimant  does not contest  the light\n\nwork   determination,   per   se,  the   no-frequent-stooping\n\nrestriction  does  not,  as  is  argued,  further  limit  the\n\nnarrowed  range  of  specific  light  jobs  the  ALJ  decided\n\nclaimant could do.2  Dr.  Ortiz, a neurologist who  performed\n\nan examination  for the Secretary, found  that claimant could\n\noccasionally  stoop.    Dr.  Grovas,  an  orthopaedic surgeon\n\nconsulted  by claimant,  also determined  that he  could bend\n\noccasionally.  Thus, the  ALJ's hypothetical, as delimited to\n\nthe range of  light work, adequately  took into account  that\n\nvirtually all light work jobs require no more than occasional\n\nstooping,  an  activity  which, the  uncontradicted  evidence\n\nshows, remained  within  claimant's residual  capacity.   See\n                                                             \n\nKeating  v. Secretary  of HHS,  848 F.2d  271, 274  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1988).    Moreover,  the  claimant  had,  but  did  not  take\n\nadvantage of,  the opportunity  to pose his  own hypothetical\n\nand correct any perceived  inadequacies.  Torres v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof HHS, 870 F.2d 742, 746 (1st Cir. 1989).\n      \n\n                    \n\n2.   And, the capacity for  light unskilled work  represents,\noverall,  a  substantial  vocational  scope  for   a  younger\nindividual (age 18-49) such  as claimant who was 36  when his\ninsured  status expired.   Medical-Vocational  Guidelines, 20\nC.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 2,   202.00 (g).\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Finally,  the  ALJ did  not, as  claimant contends,\n\nmechanically  apply  the  rules  of   the  Medical-Vocational\n\nGuidelines,  20  C.F.R.  Part  404, Subpt.  P,  App.  2  (the\n\n\"Grid\"),  to  determine the availability  of other work  that\n\nthe claimant could  still do.  Ortiz v. Secretary of HHS, 890\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  520,  524  (1st  Cir.  1989).    After considering  the\n\nindividualized evidence  offered by a vocational  expert, the\n\nALJ merely referred to a  particular rule3 as a  \"framework\",\n\ni.e.,   additional  support   for   the  ultimate   decision.\n\nClaimant's  assertion that  the  ALJ \"disposed  of\" the  case\n\nusing a Grid  rule is simply incorrect.  Nor  does the record\n\nindicate  that  the ALJ  failed  to  consider the  cumulative\n\neffect of  claimant's physical  and mental impairments.   The\n\nALJ's   decision  clearly  manifests   that  both  claimant's\n\nphysical and mental residual capacity were taken into account\n\nin determining  a narrowed light work  occupational base, and\n\nsubstantial evidence supports those predicate findings.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n3.
