Defendants Pablo\n                                        \n\nGarcia and Jose  Garcia (no relation) were tried  jointly and\n\nconvicted by a jury in  federal district court for possession\n\nof cocaine  with intent to distribute, in  violation of Title\n\n21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1), and conspiracy to possess cocaine with\n\nintent  to distribute, in violation of Title 21 U.S.C.   846.\n\nOn  appeal, defendants-appellants  both argue:  (1) that  the\n\nevidence  was  insufficient to  support the  convictions; (2)\n\nthat the  district judge  erred in vacating  the magistrate's\n\norder   compelling   the  attendance   of   the  government's\n\nconfidential informant at a suppression hearing; and (3) that\n\nthe  district  judge erred  in  failing  to suppress  certain\n\nevidence.   In addition,  defendant Pablo Garcia  argues that\n\nthe district judge  erred in admitting evidence  of his prior\n\narrest pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          On February 6, 1991, the Providence police executed\n\na  search  warrant for  narcotics  and related  items  in the\n\nsecond floor apartment of  a three-story tenement building at\n\n93-95 Gallatin Street.  The  search warrant had been obtained\n\npursuant  to information  the police  received to  the effect\n\nthat drug  trafficking was being conducted  in the apartment.\n\nThe  police had  confirmed  the information  by conducting  a\n\n\"controlled  buy.\"   In  executing  the  warrant, the  police\n\nannounced their presence,  waited approximately ten  seconds,\n\nand receiving  no response,  proceeded forcibly to  enter the\n\napartment.    Upon their  entry,  the  police found  the  two\n\ndefendants and  a woman holding a child  in the front room of\n\nthe apartment.  The woman, Altagracia Lopez, shared the front\n\nroom of  the  apartment  with  Oscar Quinones,  who  was  not\n\npresent at the time of the defendants' arrest.\n\n          Defendants were made to lie on the  floor while the\n\npolice initiated  a search  of the  apartment.   INS  Special\n\nAgent  Bernstein testified  that  he gave  defendants Miranda\n                                                             \n\nwarnings in Spanish.  In the  closet of the back bedroom, the\n\npolice  found approximately  ten  and  one-half  ounces  (295\n\ngrams) of suspected cocaine in one of several opaque  plastic\n\nbags  on the  closet's  floor.   The  substance later  tested\n\npositive  as  cocaine, and  was  valued  between $13,650  and\n\n$16,800.   Also in the  closet were articles  of clothing and\n\nscattered  papers,  including  a  bill  of  sale  and  a  car\n\nregistration in  the name of  Pablo Garcia registered  to the\n\naddress  of 93-95 Gallatin Street.   Under a  mattress in the\n\nfront room, the police discovered a passport for Pablo Garcia\n\nand a number of  notebooks with figures and names  that a DEA\n\nagent testified were  records of narcotics  dealing.  In  the\n\nbox spring  under the  mattress, the  police found  $1,308 in\n\ncash.   Finally,  on the  kitchen counter,  police discovered\n\nplastic ziploc  bags that had  been cut,  and a candle  and a\n\n                             -3-\n\nstrainer.  At  trial, DEA  agents testified  that these  were\n\npackaging materials for cocaine distribution. \n\n          The police took Pablo  and Jose separately into the\n\nroom where the cocaine had been found, and asked each of them\n\nto identify a piece of clothing that belonged to them.  Pablo\n\npicked out a shirt and jacket (later revealed to be a woman's\n\njacket).   Jose picked out a  shirt.  Also in  that room were\n\ntwo  mattresses, one of  which was propped  against the wall.\n\nThe  closet in the  back bedroom was  the only  closet in the\n\napartment.\n\n          Both   defendants  took  the  stand  at  trial  and\n\ntestified in  their own defense.   While admitting  that they\n\nboth slept in the room  in which the cocaine was  found, they\n\ndenied  knowing that there was  cocaine in the  closet.  Both\n\nalso  denied  knowing  of  the  presence  of  the other  drug\n\nparaphernalia  in the  apartment or  of any  drug trafficking\n\noperation.  \n\n          Defendants  presented  different  explanations  for\n\ntheir presence in the apartment.   Jose Garcia testified that\n\nhe had lived in the back room at  93-95 Gallatin Street since\n\nthe previous August or  September.  He said that  he had been\n\nin  Santo Domingo  from December 23,  1990 until  January 23,\n\n1991,  and that he  had spent a  few days in  New York before\n\nreturning  to Providence.    He returned  to find  that Pablo\n\nGarcia, whom  he had never  met, was  staying in the  room he\n\n                             -4-\n\nrented.   He testified that  he had been trying  to move from\n\nthe apartment when the arrest took place, and that he already\n\nhad moved many of his belongings to a friend's home.\n\n          Pablo Garcia  testified that he lived  in New York,\n\nbut had come to Providence in February to stand trial for his\n\narrest,  in  December 1990,  for  cocaine  trafficking.   The\n\ndistrict judge had, before Pablo testified, admitted evidence\n\nof this  prior arrest  as probative of  defendant's knowledge\n\nand  intent  to  commit   the  offenses  at  issue.     Pablo\n\nacknowledged  that  he was  a friend  of Oscar  Quinones, but\n\nmaintained that he did not know  Jose Garcia, and that he had\n\nno real control over the room or the apartment because he was\n\nonly temporarily residing there.  \n\n                             II.\n\n                 Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                                            \n\n          Defendants   both  appeal   the  denial   of  their\n\nrespective  motions for  judgment of  acquittal.1   Both were\n\nconvicted of  possessing and  conspiring  to possess  cocaine\n\nwith the intent  to distribute.   Defendants assert that  the\n\nprosecution failed to prove,  beyond a reasonable doubt, both\n\nknowing possession of the  cocaine and their participation in\n\na conspiracy to possess cocaine.\n\n                    \n\n1  Pablo  Garcia  and  Jose  Garcia  have  each  adopted,  by\nreference, the other's brief.  See F.R.A.P. 28(i).\n                                  \n\n                             -5-\n\n          The   standards  governing   a  challenge   to  the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence are familiar and oft-quoted:\n\n          The challenges to  the sufficiency of the\n          evidence and to the  denial of the motion\n          for judgments of acquittal raise a single\n          issue.  We assess the  sufficiency of the\n          evidence  as  a   whole,  including   all\n          reasonable inferences, in the  light most\n          favorable to the verdict,  with a view to\n          whether  a rational  trier of  fact could\n          have  found the defendant guilty beyond a\n          reasonable  doubt.     We  do  not  weigh\n          witness  credibility,   but  resolve  all\n          credibility  issues  in   favor  of   the\n          verdict.   The  evidence may  be entirely\n          circumstantial,  and   need  not  exclude\n          every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;\n          that is, the  factfinder may decide among\n          reasonable    interpretations   of    the\n          evidence.\n\nUnited States v.

Substantive Offense\n                       \n\n          The charge of possession with intent to  distribute\n\ncocaine requires, in the context of this case, proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the cocaine found  in the closet within\n\nthe room shared by defendants was knowingly and intentionally\n\npossessed by them  for purposes of distribution.   See United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Mere presence\n\nor association with another  who possessed the contraband is,\n\nhowever, insufficient to  establish constructive  possession.\n\nUnited  States v. Wight, 968  F.2d at 1397;  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 18.\n               \n\n          This  case  is very  similar  to  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nVargas, 945 F.2d 426, and the analysis flows accordingly.  In\n      \n\n                             -7-\n\nVargas,  a  search   warrant  was  executed  at   defendant's\n      \n\napartment when defendant was playing cards in a kitchen with,\n\namong  others,   an  alleged  co-conspirator.     The  search\n\nuncovered:  one kilogram of cocaine concealed behind a wooden\n\nbaseboard in  a bedroom  with the co-conspirator's  passport;\n\ndrug ledgers on top of a bureau and $2,400 in a jacket pocket\n\nin the only other  bedroom, and a narcotics notebook  in open\n\nview in the kitchen.  We affirmed both the possession and the\n\nconspiracy charges.  \n\n          On the  possession charge,  we held that  there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that\n\ndefendant  enjoyed  either  exclusive or  joint  dominion and\n\ncontrol of the apartment during the days preceding the police\n\nraid.  We found that  there was ample circumstantial evidence\n\nfor a finding that the cocaine was intended for distribution:\n\nfrom the quantity it was reasonable to infer that the cocaine\n\nwas not  merely for  personal consumption and  such inference\n\nwas  buttressed  by the  large amount  of  cash and  the drug\n\nrecords  in open view.  In language directly apposite to this\n\ncase, we  concluded that,  \"it would be  reasonable to  infer\n\nthat no non-occupant,  other than a confidant  of the tenant,\n\nwould  deposit a valuable cache of contraband in a bedroom of\n\nan unsuspecting tenant's apartment from which retrieval would\n\nbe much more difficult at best, and the risk of discovery and\n\nloss  far  greater, than  if  a more  accessible  and closely\n\n                             -8-\n\ncontrolled location were used or the  secret were shared with\n\nthe  tenant.\"  United States  v.  Vargas,  945  F.2d at  429.\n                                        \n\nSimilarly, the evidence in this case was sufficient to permit\n\na  rational  jury to  find that  both  Pablo Garcia  and Jose\n\nGarcia  constructively possessed  the  cocaine.    They  both\n\nshared  dominion and control over the  area where the cocaine\n\nwas found.   Both men admitted to living  in the second floor\n\napartment and to jointly occupying the rear bedroom where the\n\ncocaine was found; Jose exclusively for the prior five or six\n\nmonths,  and  both Pablo  and Jose  for the  week immediately\n\npreceding the raid.  At the time of the search, both told the\n\npolice  that the apartment was  where they lived.   After the\n\nsearch uncovered cocaine, both were separately taken into the\n\nbedroom and asked  to pick  out an article  of clothing  that\n\nbelonged to them, which they did.  Also found on the floor of\n\nthe  closet  along with  the  cocaine  were various  personal\n\npapers belonging  to Pablo, including  car registration forms\n\nregistered to  93-95 Gallatin  Street.  In  addition, Pablo's\n\npassport, concealed along  with a large  amount of money  and\n\nrecords of drug sales, was also found during  the search.  As\n\nwe stated in Vargas, \"[e]vidence sufficient to establish that\n                   \n\nthe accused  shared dominion and control of  the premises can\n\nserve  as   a  sufficient  basis  for   inferring  a  knowing\n\npossession of  contraband where the  evidence indicates  that\n\nthe  accused,  either alone  or  jointly  with  one  or  more\n\n                             -9-\n\npersons,  intended  to facilitate  the  possession.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Vargas, 945 F.2d at 428.  \n                \n\n          There was  also ample evidence from  which the jury\n\ncould  find  that the  cocaine  discovered  was intended  for\n\ndistribution.  The quantity of cocaine (295 grams), the large\n\namount of  cash, the drug records,  and cocaine paraphernalia\n\nin  plain view, were  all links in  a chain of  evidence from\n\nwhich intent  to  distribute cocaine  could  be found.

On  September 5,  the magistrate  issued a\n\nsecond order stating, in pertinent part, that,\n\n          the  person  who  bought  cocaine  at  95\n          Gallatin Street, 2nd  Floor on behalf  of\n          the  police,  be  served  by  the  United\n          States   Marshal  Service,   through  the\n          United  States Attorney,  with a  copy of\n          this order  to compel attendance  of this\n          witness  at a Motion  to Suppress hearing\n          to be  held by  Judge Lagueux at  a date,\n          time and  place to be fixed and specified\n          by  Judge  Lagueux.    Counsel   for  the\n          Defendant shall be  allowed to meet  with\n          such witness just  prior to said hearing.\n\nThe government  appealed this  second motion to  the district\n\ncourt  judge.3   The  district judge  held  a hearing  on the\n\ngovernment's appeal.  He determined that the defendant failed\n\nto make  the preliminary  showing as  required  by Franks  v.\n                                                         \n\nDelaware,  438 U.S.  154 (1978),  in order  for the  court to\n        \n\nconduct  an evidentiary hearing on the validity of the search\n\nwarrant.   The  judge  explained that  it  appeared that  the\n\nmagistrate's order assumed that  the district judge was going\n\n                    \n\n3    Local Rule  32(b)(2)  provides in  pertinent  part that,\n\"[a]ny  party may  appeal from  a magistrate's  determination\nmade under this rule within 10 days after the issuance of the\nmagistrate's order.\"   \n\n                             -12-\n\nto  conduct a hearing, that the  defense had failed to make a\n\nproper  case for  the hearing,  and  that, absent  a hearing,\n\nthere was no  requirement that  the informant appear.   At  a\n\nlater hearing on October 31, 1991, the judge refused to grant\n\ndefendant a  subpoena ex parte, and  delayed determination of\n                              \n\nwhether  the   informant  could   be  subpoenaed   until  the\n\nappropriate time at  trial.  Pablo  Garcia never renewed  his\n\nmotion for a subpoena at trial. \n\n          A magistrate's  discovery  order may  be set  aside\n\nwhere  the  order is  clearly erroneous  or contrary  to law.\n\nFischer  v.

The district\n\njudge  determined that  the  magistrate's  order was  clearly\n\nerroneous because it compelled the  confidential informant to\n\nattend a suppression  hearing when the district judge had not\n\nyet determined whether he  would conduct such a hearing.   We\n\nfind   that   the  district   court   properly  vacated   the\n\nmagistrate's order.\n\n                             IV.\n\n                   The Suppression Motions \n                                          \n\nA.  Probable Cause\n                  \n\n          Defendant  Pablo  Garcia  challenges  the  district\n\ncourt's  denial of  his  motion to  suppress evidence  seized\n\nduring the search of  the apartment on the ground  that there\n\n                             -13-\n\nwas no probable cause for the officers to execute the search.\n\nIn particular,  he asserts that the  affidavit underlying the\n\nsearch  warrant  upon  which   the  search  team  relied  was\n\ndeficient.   The search warrant  was issued by  a state court\n\njudge for the  state of  Rhode Island upon  the affidavit  of\n\nDetective Zammarelli.   That  affidavit, in  essence, stated:\n\nthat Detective Zammarelli had reason to believe that a large-\n\nscale  drug operation was  being conducted out  of the second\n\nfloor  apartment of 93-95 Gallatin Street; that he met with a\n\nreliable  confidential  informant  who  told  him  that   two\n\nHispanic  persons were  storing and  selling drugs;  that the\n\ninformant had seen large amounts of cocaine in the apartment;\n\nand   that,  to   corroborate  this   information,  Detective\n\nZammarelli executed a \"controlled buy\" through the informant.\n\nThe   affidavit  fully   described   the  \"controlled   buy.\"\n\nDetective Zammarelli reported  searching the informant  prior\n\nto the  buy and finding no contraband on him.  He stated that\n\nhe gave the informant a sum of U.S. currency, followed him to\n\nthe  apartment,  watched him  enter the  front door  of 93-95\n\nGallatin  Street, and observed  him exit a  few minutes later\n\nfrom  the same door.   Next, he stated  in the affidavit that\n\nthe informant then handed  Detective Zammarelli a quantity of\n\ncocaine, reporting  that he had purchased  the substance from\n\nthe Hispanic male who resided in the second floor apartment. \n\nDetective Zammarelli  stated that  he made another  search of\n\n                             -14-\n\nthe informant and found  no contraband.  Later,  upon testing\n\nthe substance,  Detective  Zammarelli confirmed  that it  was\n\ncocaine.\n\n          The   district  court  determined  that  there  was\n\nsufficient  probable   cause  stated  on  the   face  of  the\n\naffidavit,  finding  that  the information  provided  therein\n\nwould lead a  reasonable person to  believe that cocaine  was\n\nbeing sold from the second floor apartment.      \n\n          We  review the district  court's decision to uphold\n\nthe  warrant only for clear error.

More generally,  he argues that\n\nthis affidavit is the sort of \"bare bones\" affidavit that the\n\nSupreme Court criticized  in United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 915.  We disagree with both of these contentions.  \n\n          Detective Zammarelli confirmed the information with\n\nwhich the confidential informant provided him by carrying out\n\na carefully-executed \"controlled buy.\"  Given   its  greatest\n\nforce,  defendant's argument  against this  corroboration was\n\nthat  one  and  the same  informant  was  the  source of  the\n\ninformation and the  actor in the \"controlled  buy,\" and that\n\nthe  informant might  have stashed  cocaine elsewhere  in the\n\nbuilding  out   of  the  sight   of  the  detective.     This\n\npossibility, defendant  posits, undercuts the  reliability of\n\nthe informant.  Although defendant's argument is possible, it\n\nis  not  probable and  strains  credulity  on a  common-sense\n\nreading.  We find that both the issuing state court judge and\n\nthe district  judge drew  a reasonable inference  of probable\n\ncause that  there was  drug trafficking in  the second  floor\n\napartment  of 93-95 Gallatin Street.  We affirm the denial of\n\nthe motion to  suppress the evidence  seized pursuant to  the\n\nwarrant.\n\nB.  Execution of Warrant\n                        \n\n                             -16-\n\n          Pablo  Garcia  next challenges  the  denial  of his\n\nmotion  to  suppress  certain  statements  made and  evidence\n\nseized  during the search of the apartment on the ground that\n\nthe execution  of the search warrant  was unlawful, resulting\n\nin an unconstitutional search and seizure. \n\n          In reviewing  a denial of a  suppression motion, we\n\nmust  uphold the  district court's  findings unless  they are\n\nclearly erroneous; the court's ultimate  conclusion, however,\n\nis  subject to plenary review.  United States v. Sanchez, 943\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 110, 112 (1st  Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).

Detectives Della\n\nVentura  and Zammarelli were part  of the search  team at the\n\napartment's front door.   Detective  Della Ventura  testified\n\nthat  he knocked  loudly  on the  door  and shouted  \"Police,\n\nsearch warrant, open the door.\"   After waiting approximately\n\nten   seconds   without  receiving   a   response  (Detective\n\n                             -17-\n\nZammarelli estimated ten to fifteen seconds), the search team\n\nforcibly  entered the apartment.   Upon  entering, defendants\n\nwere immediately restrained.\n\n          At  the hearing,  defendant Pablo Garcia  sought to\n\nsuppress all evidence seized from  the apartment on the basis\n\nthat the execution of the warrant was conducted  in violation\n\nof  the \"knock  and announce\"  rule, 18  U.S.C.    31094, and\n\nsuch  violation rendered  the subsequent  search warrantless.\n\nPablo   Garcia  argued,  alternatively,   that  no  knock  or\n\nannouncement  was  made at  all;  that  the announcement  was\n\ninadequate when considering  the purpose of the rule;  or, if\n\nthe  announcement  was adequate,  that  the  ten second  wait\n\nbefore  forcibly entering was, as  a matter of  law, not long\n\nenough.\n\n          After  hearing  the  testimony  of the  two  police\n\nofficers who executed  the warrant and  of Pablo Garcia,  the\n\ndistrict  judge found that  the police  did loudly  knock and\n\nannounce  their presence  and purpose  as required,  and that\n\nthey entered the apartment  when they believed that  they had\n\nbeen  refused admission.   The  district judge  was satisfied\n\n                    \n\n4 18 U.S.C.   3109 states in pertinent part:\n          The officer  may break open any  outer or\n          inner door  or window of a  house, or any\n          part of a house, or  anything therein, to\n          execute  a  search  warrant,   if,  after\n          notice of his  authority and purpose,  he\n          is refused admittance  or when  necessary\n          to  liberate himself  or a  person aiding\n          him in the execution of the warrant.\n\n                             -18-\n\nthat,  in the context of a  drug raid where contraband can be\n\ndisposed  of within seconds,  the ten to  fifteen second wait\n\nwas  a reasonable period of time, and that the officers fully\n\ncomplied with the \"knock and announce\" rule.  \n\n          The  district  court's  findings  are  not  clearly\n\nerroneous.   Under the circumstances,  a wait of  ten seconds\n\nafter knocking  combined with  an announcement  before forced\n\nentry, was reasonable.  The  occupants of the apartment  were\n\nreasonably believed  to possess cocaine, a  substance that is\n\neasily and quickly hidden or destroyed.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nOne  Parcel  of  Real Property,  873  F.2d  7,  9 (1st  Cir.)\n                              \n\n(shorter wait [five to ten seconds] before entry justified by\n\nfact that  officers had  probable cause to  believe occupants\n\npossessed  cocaine, a  substance that  is easily  and quickly\n\nremoved  down a toilet), cert. denied  sub nom, Latreverse v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 493 U.S. 891 (1989). \n             \n\nC.  Adequacy of Miranda Warnings\n                                \n\n          Finally with regard to the  district court's denial\n\nof  his motions  to suppress,  defendant Pablo  Garcia argues\n\nthat  the  law  enforcement  officials  failed  to adequately\n\napprise him of his rights in violation of Miranda v. Arizona,\n                                                            \n\n384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n          Upon  entering the apartment, the police restrained\n\nthe defendant  and placed him face down on the floor.  As the\n\nsearch  commenced,  INS  Special  Agent  Bernstein  gave  the\n\n                             -19-\n\ndefendant Miranda warnings in Spanish.  He specifically asked\n                 \n\ndefendant if  he understood each right as it was read to him.\n\nAfter   each   such   question,   the   defendant   responded\n\naffirmatively.   After advising  defendant of his  rights and\n\nbeing told  by the defendant  that he understood  them, Agent\n\nBernstein asked  the defendant if  he was  willing to  answer\n\nsome  questions   without  the   presence  of   an  attorney.\n\nDefendant  agreed  and  told  the  officer  he  would  answer\n\nquestions.    Agent  Bernstein  then  asked  defendant  basic\n\ninformational questions, such as where he lived.  The answers\n\nto some of the questions were incriminating.  \n\n          After  the discovery  of  the cocaine  in the  rear\n\nbedroom, Agent Bernstein took  the defendant, alone, into the\n\nbedroom  and  asked him  if  any  clothing belonged  to  him.\n\nDefendant  responded  affirmatively.   Agent  Bernstein  then\n\nasked  him  to  point out  something  that  was  his.   Being\n\nhandcuffed, defendant motioned with his head to a shirt and a\n\njacket.   Agent Bernstein identified the shirt and jacket and\n\nasked  defendant  if  they   were  his;  defendant   answered\n\naffirmatively.5\n\n          At the suppression hearing, Pablo Garcia had sought\n\nto suppress the incriminating  statements and actions he made\n\nduring  the search of the  apartment on the  ground that they\n\n                    \n\n5  Special Agent  Bernstein's  treatment of  Jose Garcia  was\nsubstantially the same, and the same analysis applies. \n\n                             -20-\n\nwere  made  without an  intelligent,  knowing,  and voluntary\n\nwaiver  of his Fifth Amendment rights.  Defendant argued that\n\nthe officer was required to  specifically advise him that his\n\nanswers to the informational  questions could be used against\n\nhim, and because he was never  so advised, he could not  have\n\nknowingly waived  his rights.  In  addition, defendant argued\n\nthat the warnings were  inadequate because the officer should\n\nhave  advised defendant that  anything he  did could  be used\n                                              \n\nagainst  him, and  that defendant  had a  right to  refuse to\n\npoint out such clothing that belonged to him.\n\n          When an individual is taken into custody and before\n\ninterrogation,  Miranda  requires   that  the  individual  be\n                       \n\nadvised:   that  he  has the  right  to remain  silent;  that\n\nanything he  says may be used  against him in court;  that he\n\nhas  the right  to  consult an  attorney  before being  asked\n\nquestions;  that   the   attorney  may   be  present   during\n\nquestioning;  and that if  he cannot afford  an attorney, one\n\nwill be appointed for him if he wishes.

Background\n              \n\n          This  final issue  is the most  difficult one.   It\n\ninvolves  the  questions  of  whether,  and,  if  so,  how  a\n\ndefendant can  avoid  the  admission  of prior  bad  acts  by\n\nstipulating that knowledge  and intent are not contested.  We\n\nfirst  rehearse  in extenso  what  happened  in the  district\n                           \n\ncourt.\n\n          Prior to trial, defendant Pablo Garcia requested  a\n\nruling from the district  court as to whether it  would admit\n\nevidence  under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)6 of his prior arrest for\n\ndealing in  cocaine.   The  court deferred  ruling until  the\n\nevidence became relevant at trial.\n\n          At the  start of the  trial, but before  the jurors\n\nwere in the courtroom, the attorney for Pablo Garcia (Francis\n\nJ. Gillan, III) requested that the government  not be allowed\n\nto mention the 404(b)  evidence in its opening and  that none\n\nof  the  witnesses be  allowed to  testify as  to defendant's\n\nprior arrest until  the court had ruled on  the admissibility\n\n                    \n\n6 Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides that:\n          Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\n          is  not admissible to prove the character\n          of a  person in  order to show  action in\n          conformity therewith.   It may,  however,\n          be admissible for other purposes, such as\n          proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\n          preparation,  plan, knowledge,  identity,\n          or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n                             -24-\n\nof  the evidence.    The prosecutor  stated  that he  had  no\n\nintention of  referring to  the evidence in  his opening  and\n\nthat  he  would  instruct  his witness  not  to  mention  the\n\nprevious arrest.  The court then stated that there would be a\n\nhearing on  the question  in the absence  of the jury  at the\n\ntime the prosecutor wished to introduce the evidence.\n\n          Counsel  for the  defendant  Jose  Garcia (John  M.\n\nCicilline),  then informed the  court that  he might  want to\n\nelicit  testimony as to the  prior arrest of  Pablo Garcia in\n\ncross-examination of government witnesses.  The court  stated\n\nthat he would rule on the question at the appropriate time.\n\n          After the trial had progressed, Attorney Cicilline,\n\ncounsel for Jose Garcia, informed the court that he wanted to\n\nelicit testimony about Pablo  Garcia's prior arrest in cross-\n\nexamination of the next government witness, a DEA agent.  The\n\ncourt  then  held a  hearing  on  the  admissibility  of  the\n\nevidence.\n\n          After hearing Attorney Cicilline on the question of\n\nrelevancy, the court heard argument by Attorney Gillan, Pablo\n\nGarcia's attorney,  as  to why  the  evidence should  not  be\n\nadmitted.   The prosecutor then advised the court that he was\n\nnot  going to offer the  evidence through the  DEA agent, but\n\nthat he intended  to offer testimony on  Pablo Garcia's prior\n\narrest by  a detective  on the Providence  Police Department.\n\nThe detective would testify that, within the last six months,\n\n                             -25-\n\nhe  had  arrested  Pablo Garcia  on  a  cocaine charge  after\n\npersonally  witnessing the transaction  in which Pablo Garcia\n\nwas involved.\n\n          During the course of the argument by Pablo Garcia's\n\nattorney, the court commented:\n\n               Well, one of  the requirements  that\n          the  government must prove  is that there\n          was possession, number 1, and number two,\n          that   it  was   was   [sic]  a   knowing\n          possession.  So, doesn't this evidence go\n          to   question   [sic]   of  whether   the\n          possession was knowing?\n\nAfter hearing further argument  by Pablo Garcia's counsel the\n\ncourt ruled:\n\n               Well, I  think the rule is clear, as\n          has been explicated by the  First Circuit\n          with  the one  exception that  I referred\n          to,  that   this  kind  of   evidence  is\n          admissible  as  proof of  motive, intent,\n          plan, knowledge, in  this kind of  a case\n          where there's a charge of possession with\n          intent to distribute, and also,  a charge\n          of  conspiracy. . .  .   It's admissible.\n          The prosecution  can put  it in.   So, if\n          the prosecution doesn't choose to  put it\n          in, one of the other defendants can bring\n          it out.\n\n          Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  Rule  404(b)\n\ntestimony that the court had ruled would be admissible, Pablo\n\nGarcia's  attorney  tried again  to  have  it excluded.    He\n\nstated, inter alia:\n                  \n\n               Number  1, your Honor  had said that\n          this  evidence  was important  because it\n          would   go   to   issue  of   intent   to\n          distribute.    A  prior  sale  equals  an\n          intent  to  distribute on  this occasion.\n          With  that  in   mind,  your  Honor,  and\n\n                             -26-\n\n          reading Rubio Estrada  again last  night,\n          where  the Court  had  said  that     had\n          mentioned the facts [sic] that intent was\n          important.  I would  respectfully suggest\n          that if intent was at issue, based on the\n          testimony we heard  from Detective  Della\n          Ventura  and  thus  far   from  Detective\n          Zammarelli, I wouldn't contest  intent to\n          distribute, insofar as there is more than\n          ample  evidence  that  whoever  possessed\n          that  cocaine,  possessed  it   with  the\n          intent to distribute.  So, if the  404(b)\n          evidence goes to the intention of someone\n          to  distribute  that  cocaine,   I  would\n          suggest, your  Honor,  that if  the  jury\n          finds  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that\n          Pablo  Garcia  possessed,  did   in  fact\n          possess  that  cocaine,   then  I   would\n          stipulate  that they can find from there,\n          that  he did  so  with  the intention  to\n          distribute that cocaine.\n\n          After   counsel's   further   argument  on   unfair\n\nprejudice the following colloquy took place:\n\n               THE COURT:   It may be.   It may be.\n          And  people in  your  position  say  it's\n          unfair  prejudice.    I  say,  it's  fair\n          prejudice  because   it's  fair  evidence\n          against  this  defendant  because  he  is\n          being  charged  with knowing  possession,\n          and that's  an issue in this  case.  He's\n          going  to tell  us, and  you're going  to\n          argue  to the jury, that he just happened\n          to  be  there, wrong  place at  the wrong\n          time, doesn't know anything about cocaine\n          trafficking.\n\n               Mr.   GILLAN:  No, I  don't say that\n          he  doesn't  know anything  about cocaine\n          trafficking, just that he's  not involved\n          in this enterprise.\n\n               THE  COURT:    Well,  this  evidence\n          indicates that he is.\n\n               MR. GILLAN:  Thank you, your Honor.\n\n                             -27-\n\n               THE  COURT:   And  that's  why  it's\n          relevant,  and  that's why  it's properly\n          admissible under the  rule because  there\n          is an issue of knowing possession . . .\n\n          Detective  Zammarelli  testified  that, two  months\n\nprior to the arrest  of Jose Garcia and Pablo  Garcia, he and\n\nDetective  Della Ventura  (also  involved in  the arrests  of\n\nPablo  and Jose)  arrested Pablo  Garcia  in Providence  at a\n\ndifferent location.   Detective Zammarelli testified  that he\n\nobserved, through a large glass window, three men engaged  in\n\ndiscussion.   One  of the  men handed  money to  another, who\n\nbegan  to  speak with  the third  man,  Pablo Garcia.   Pablo\n\nGarcia then  walked out  of Detective Zammarelli's  view, and\n\nreturned to hand  a bag of suspected cocaine  to the man from\n\nwhom  he obtained  money.   Detective Zammarelli,  along with\n\nDetective Della Ventura, then arrested the  three men.  Pablo\n\nGarcia  was charged  with  unlawful delivery  of cocaine  and\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Immediately   after   this  testimony,   the  court\n\ninstructed the jury:\n\n          . .  .  Mr.  Foreman and  members of  the\n          jury,  sometimes  evidence is  admissible\n          for  one purpose, but it's not admissible\n          for another  purpose.  So, the  Court has\n          to allow  the  evidence in  because  it's\n          relevant on some point  in the case.  But\n          I have to advise you, as jurors, that you\n          can't consider it on some other  point in\n          the case.\n\n               The rule of evidence that's involved\n          is  rule  404(b) which  relates  to other\n          crimes or wrongs, prior bad  acts as it's\n\n                             -28-\n\n          often  referred  to.   Evidence  of other\n          crimes, wrongs or  acts is not admissible\n          to prove  the  character of  a person  in\n          order  to  show   action  in   conformity\n          therewith.      It   may,   however,   be\n          admissible  for  other  purposes such  as\n          proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\n          preparation,  plan, knowledge,  identity,\n          or  absence  of   mistake  or   accident.\n          That's the rule.   What it means is that,\n          in a  criminal trial  for an  offense you\n          can't   bring   in   evidence  of   other\n          offenses, just to show that the defendant\n          is  a bad  person and  is likely  to have\n          committed  this  offense.     That's  not\n          admissible for that purpose.  However, it\n          is admissible to show knowledge or intent\n          or motive or plan.  \n\n               I have  ruled that this  evidence is\n          admissible  in  this  case against  Pablo\n          Garcia because two  of the issues in  the\n          case  relate  to  his knowledge  and  his\n          intent.   First  of all,  he has  to have\n          knowing possession of the cocaine in this\n          case, and  also, he is  charged with  not\n          only  knowing  possession but  possession\n          with  intent to distribute.  And so, this\n          evidence relates to  his knowledge  about\n          cocaine   and    whether   he   knowingly\n          possessed   it   in  that   apartment  on\n          Gallatin   Street,   and   also,  if   he\n          possessed  it,  whether  he possessed  it\n          with intent to distribute.\n\n               So, you may  consider this  evidence\n          or  prior  acts by  the  defendant, Pablo\n          Garcia,  only  on  the  question  of  his\n          knowledge  and intent  in this  case; and\n          the  government has the burden of proving\n          those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis  instruction  was given  in  abridged form  in  the jury\n\ncharge.   It  is  to be  noted  that the  prosecutor did  not\n\nmention the prior arrest in his closing argument.\n\n                             -29-\n\n          On appeal, defendant argues that the district court\n\nerred  in  admitting the  404(b)  evidence  for two  reasons.\n\nFirst, defendant contends that it was impermissible  evidence\n\nof  bad  character  and  that it  was  unfairly  prejudicial.\n\nSecond, defendant argues that  the district court should have\n\naccepted his  attempt to foreclose admission  of the evidence\n\nby  offering to concede the issues of intent and knowledge to\n\nwhich  the evidence was directed.  We begin by addressing the\n\nadmissibility of the evidence. \n\nB.  Admissibility of the Evidence  \nB.  Admissibility of the Evidence\n                                 \n\n          Evidence of  prior bad acts is admissible, pursuant\n\nto   Fed.  R.

The trial judge first determines\n\nwhether  the  evidence  has  some \"special\"  probative  value\n\nshowing intent, preparation, knowledge or absence of mistake.\n\nSee United States  v.

In this case,\n                                              \n\nthe district  judge admitted  the evidence of  Pablo Garcia's\n\nprior arrest  for dealing cocaine  as relevant to  intent and\n\nknowledge.\n\n          When   he  first  ruled   that  the   evidence  was\n\nadmissible,  the district judge  relied on  what he  called a\n\nclear rule in this  circuit of admitting prior acts  evidence\n\nas  proof  of knowledge,  intent,  etc.,  in cases  involving\n\npossession  and  conspiracy.   As  we  explained recently  in\n\n                    \n\n7  Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides that:\n          Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\n          issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\n          considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\n          time,   or   needless   presentation   of\n          cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nUnited States v.

Pablo Garcia was arrested\n\nonly two months earlier by two of the  same officers who made\n\nthe arrest  precipitating the current charges.   The previous\n\narrest  was for dealing in  cocaine, an act  which is similar\n\nand has  special relevance to  the charge of  possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine.   We find that the  trial judge\n\nwas correct  in concluding  that Pablo Garcia's  prior arrest\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nfor dealing in cocaine could provide the basis for reasonable\n\ninferences going  to  defendant's knowledge  and intent  that\n\nwere not based solely on bad character.

United States, 493  U.S. 1030 (1990).   This case\n                         \n\ndoes not present any such exceptional circumstances.\n\n          We  note  that  the  evidence  involved  an arrest,\n\nrather  than  a  conviction, and  involved  two  of  the same\n\nofficers  who  participated  in  the arrest  leading  to  the\n\ncharges  at  issue.    These circumstances  might  well  have\n\nexaggerated the prejudicial effects of the evidence, a factor\n\nnot   explicitly   addressed    by   the   district    court.\n\nNevertheless,  Rule  404(b) covers  prior  acts,  and is  not\n                                               \n\nlimited  to convictions.  From  our review of  the record, we\n\nare satisfied that there  was sufficient evidence linking the\n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\ndefendant  to the prior act.   Moreover, the  fact that Pablo\n\nGarcia  was only arrested, and  had not been   convicted, was\n\nexplained to the jury.    \n\n          Lastly, the district  court handled the  prior acts\n\nevidence  with  care,  providing  the jury  with  a  limiting\n\ninstruction  after  the  evidence  was  admitted,  and  again\n\ninstructing the jury of  the scope of prior acts  evidence in\n\nhis final charge.  \n\nC.  Defendant's Offers to Concede Knowledge and Intent\n                                                      \n\n          Having found the prior acts evidence admissible, we\n\nnow  address  defendant's  argument  that,   because  he  had\n\nconceded  the elements of  knowledge and intent  to which the\n\nevidence  was directed,  the  evidence should  not have  been\n\nadmitted.  In support  of his claim, defendant points  to two\n\nstatements  made by defense counsel prior to the admission of\n\nthe  evidence.   With  respect  to  the issue  of  knowledge,\n\ndefendant   highlights  an  unelaborated  statement  made  in\n\nresponse to the court's  discussion of the prejudicial impact\n\nof the evidence  that, \"No, I don't say that  he doesn't know\n\nanything about cocaine trafficking. . . .\"   With  respect to\n\nthe issue of intent, defendant points to  his counsel's offer\n\nto stipulate to  the intent  to distribute in  the event  the\n\njury found that Pablo Garcia, in fact, possessed the cocaine.\n\n(We excerpted the context surrounding these statements in our\n\ndiscussion  of the  background on  this issue,  supra.)   The\n                                                     \n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\ncombination   of  these  two  statements,  defendant  argues,\n\nconstituted  a  clear  offer  to  concede  that  he  had  the\n\nrequisite knowledge  and intent  to possess the  cocaine, and\n\nthe  specific  intent to  distribute  it,  if the  government\n\nproved that he possessed it.  For the reasons that follow, we\n\nfind  that  the  defendant   failed  sufficiently  to  remove\n\nknowledge  and intent from the case, and that the trial judge\n\ndid not err in admitting the evidence despite the defendant's\n\nstated concessions.\n\n          Defendant relies upon our decision in United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Figueroa,  618  F.2d 934  (2d  Cir. 1980).\n                           \n\nFigueroa held that a defendant may remove issues of knowledge\n        \n\nand intent from a case by  telling the court that he will not\n\ndispute those issues:\n\n          provided that he expresses himself to the\n                                                   \n          court with sufficient clarity  to justify\n                                       \n          the   court   in   (a)  disallowing   any\n          `subsequent  cross-examination   or  jury\n          argument  that  seeks  to   raise'  those\n          issues, and  (b) `charging the  jury that\n          if they find all  other elements beyond a\n          reasonable  doubt,  they can  resolve the\n          issue against the defendant because it is\n          not disputed.'\n\nUnited States v. Ferrer-Cruz,  899 F.2d at 139 (quoting  from\n                            \n\nUnited States v. Figueroa,  618 F.2d at  942).  The court  in\n                         \n\nFigueroa  explained   that  a  formal  stipulation   was  not\n        \n\nrequired.  Id.  The offer, however, must be unequivocal.  Id.\n                                                             \n\n                             -35-\n                              35\n\nSee  also United States v. Colon,  880 F.2d 650, 659 (2d Cir.\n                                \n\n1989); United States  v. Mohel,  604 F.2d 748,  754 (2d  Cir.\n                              \n\n1979).  \n\n          In Figueroa  the court found ample  evidence in the\n                     \n\nrecord that the defense counsel  had spoken with clarity, and\n\nhad  removed, not  merely  certain inferences  that might  be\n\ndrawn as to the  defendant's intent, but the entire  issue of\n\nintent.  Counsel had addressed  each of the court's  concerns\n\nand  had stated  \"unequivocally,\"  \"'[t]here is  no issue  of\n\nintent.'\" United States  v. Figueroa,  618 F.2d at  940.   By\n                                    \n\ncontrast,   in  Ferrer-Cruz,   we  determined   that  defense\n                           \n\ncounsel's  response to the judge that he was not arguing mere\n\npresence  did not  amount  to  a  clear offer  to  stipulate.\n\nUnited  States v. Ferrer-Cruz, 899 F.2d at 139.  In addition,\n                             \n\nwe found that,  far from  having removed the  issue from  the\n\ncase, the defense counsel  had actually argued mere presence.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          To prevent  the admission  of bad acts  evidence, a\n\ndefendant's offer to concede  knowledge and/or intent  issues\n\nmust  do two things.   First, the offer  must express a clear\n\nand unequivocal intention to remove  the issues such that, in\n                         \n\neffect  if not in form, it constitutes an offer to stipulate.\n\nSecond,  notwithstanding  the  sincerity  of  the defendant's\n\noffer, the  concession must cover  the necessary  substantive\n\nground  to remove the issues  from the case.   See generally,\n                                                            \n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n\nUnited  States v.  Colon, 880  F.2d at  658 (where  the court\n                        \n\ndetermined that the stipulation the defendant presented, even\n\nif proffered  with sincerity, failed  to remove the  issue of\n\nintent from the case).\n\n          We begin  our analysis  by noting  that it  was not\n\nonly the  government which  requested the admission  of Pablo\n\nGarcia's prior  arrest, but  defendant Jose Garcia,  as well.\n\nThe  two  statements of  concession raise  somewhat different\n\nconcerns, and we address each in turn.\n\n          We  do  not  believe  that  the  defense  counsel's\n\nstatement as to Pablo  Garcia's knowledge of drug trafficking\n\namounted to an attempt  to stipulate, nor do we  believe that\n\nit removed knowledge from the case.  First, the statement did\n\nnot rise to the level of  a clear offer to concede knowledge.\n\nIt was no  more than a  single response, among others,  in an\n\nongoing  discussion  with  the  court  about the  prejudicial\n\nimpact of  the  evidence.   By contrast  with the  successful\n\ndefendants in  both Figueroa  and Mohel, defense  counsel did\n                                       \n\nnot pursue this concession  with the court at that  time, nor\n\ndid  he raise it  again.  See United  States v. Figueroa, 618\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 940  (where defense  counsel vigorously  pursued his\n\nconcessions with the court); United States v.

At  best,  defense counsel's  statement may  be\n\nconstrued  as an  offer not  to argue  that defendant  had no\n                                     \n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\nknowledge of the  workings of drug  trafficking.

Ferrer-Cruz, 899\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 139.8 \n\n          Second,  defense  counsel's   statement  of   Pablo\n\nGarcia's relative knowledge about cocaine trafficking was not\n\nthe sort of concession which the trial judge reasonably could\n\nbe  expected  to assume  would  remove  the entire  issue  of\n\nknowledge from this case.  At most, it was a limited offer to\n\n                    \n\n8 Courts which  permit the foreclosure of 404(b)  evidence by\nconcession   or  stipulation   generally  require   that  the\ndefendant  be willing to accept  a jury charge  to the effect\nthat the issue  has been  removed from the  case.  See  e.g.,\n                                                            \nUnited States  v. Colon, 880 F.2d  at 659;  United  States v.\n                                                          \nFigueroa,  618 F.2d at  942.  Exactly  who has  the duty, the\n        \ndefense counsel or the court, to suggest such an instruction,\nhowever, remains unclear.  Figueroa seems to suggest that, so\n                                   \nlong  as  the  defendant  raises the  issue  with  sufficient\nclarity,  the judge must then remove the issue from the case,\nby disallowing  subsequent cross-examination,  and by  a jury\ncharge.  See United States v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d at 942.  Our\n                                      \ndecision in Ferrer-Cruz places the burden more clearly on the\n                       \ndefendant, as evident  in the above-cited  excerpt.  In  this\ncase, we do not need to  reach the issue because we find that\ndefendant's  statement  was  not  a  clear  offer  to  remove\nknowledge from the case.  We merely instruct that an offer to\nconcede  an  issue which  also asks  for  a jury  charge will\nappear  more sincere  and unequivocal,  and will  assist both\ntrial and reviewing courts in assessing such concession.  \n\n                             -38-\n                              38\n\nforeclose certain  inferences that the jury  might have drawn\n\nas to knowledge.  \n\n          Finally, knowledge  remained a focal  issue in  the\n\ncase, and  one vigorously contested by the  defendant.  Pablo\n\nGarcia's defense was  that he did not know of the presence of\n                                          \n\nthe cocaine in  the closet of the  room he inhabited.   Pablo\n\nGarcia also argued that  he did not  know of the presence  of\n\nthe drug paraphernalia that was  openly visible in the  small\n\napartment.    \n\n          We  turn   next  to  defense   counsel's  offer  to\n\nstipulate  to intent to distribute.  By contrast with defense\n\ncounsel's   statement  as   to   knowledge,  this   statement\n\nconstituted a clear and unequivocal offer to stipulate to one\n\nessential  element  of the  case:    the specific  intent  to\n\ndistribute.  Conceding the  specific intent to distribute did\n\nnot, however, affect  the relevance of  the evidence to  show\n\ndefendant's  knowledge and  intent  to possess  the  cocaine.\n\nDefense  counsel conceded  intent to  distribute if  the jury\n\nfound  possession.    Because there  remained  an independent\n\nbasis for admission of the\n\nevidence--the defendant's knowledge and intent to possess\n\nthe cocaine--the district court did not err in its failure to\n\nconsider the defendant's offer to stipulate in this instance.\n\n                             -39-\n                              39\n\n          The  effect  of stipulations  on  the  admission of\n\n404(b)  evidence  is confronting  us  more  frequently.   We,\n\ntherefore,  proffer some  guidance in  this area.   We  note,\n\nfirst of all, that a serious offer to concede or stipulate to\n\nissues of intent  and/or knowledge should be  explored by the\n\ndistrict court.  In the final analysis, however, whether such\n\nan offer is accepted  remains in the sound discretion  of the\n\ndistrict  judge.  If the  judge determines that  the offer is\n\nacceptable, the  judge should take  steps to assure  that the\n\ndefendant  is aware of the contents of the stipulation and of\n\nits  implications  before  directing  the jury  that  it  may\n\nresolve the issue against the defendant.  \n\n          Second,   from  a   survey  of   the  circuits   on\n\nstipulations  in  the  area   of  404(b)  evidence,  we  have\n\nascertained  a  preference  for  handling the  matter  before\n\ntrial,  or  early in  the trial  process.   See  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Defendants Pablo\n                                        \n\nGarcia and Jose  Garcia (no relation) were tried  jointly and\n\nconvicted by a jury in  federal district court for possession\n\nof cocaine  with intent to distribute, in  violation of Title\n\n21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1), and conspiracy to possess cocaine with\n\nintent  to distribute, in violation of Title 21 U.S.C.   846.\n\nOn  appeal, defendants-appellants  both argue:  (1) that  the\n\nevidence  was  insufficient to  support the  convictions; (2)\n\nthat the  district judge  erred in vacating  the magistrate's\n\norder   compelling   the  attendance   of   the  government's\n\nconfidential informant at a suppression hearing; and (3) that\n\nthe  district  judge erred  in  failing  to suppress  certain\n\nevidence.   In addition,  defendant Pablo Garcia  argues that\n\nthe district judge  erred in admitting evidence  of his prior\n\narrest pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          On February 6, 1991, the Providence police executed\n\na  search  warrant for  narcotics  and related  items  in the\n\nsecond floor apartment of  a three-story tenement building at\n\n93-95 Gallatin Street.  The  search warrant had been obtained\n\npursuant  to information  the police  received to  the effect\n\nthat drug  trafficking was being conducted  in the apartment.\n\nThe  police had  confirmed  the information  by conducting  a\n\n\"controlled  buy.\"   In  executing  the  warrant, the  police\n\nannounced their presence,  waited approximately ten  seconds,\n\nand receiving  no response,  proceeded forcibly to  enter the\n\napartment.    Upon their  entry,  the  police found  the  two\n\ndefendants and  a woman holding a child  in the front room of\n\nthe apartment.  The woman, Altagracia Lopez, shared the front\n\nroom of  the  apartment  with  Oscar Quinones,  who  was  not\n\npresent at the time of the defendants' arrest.\n\n          Defendants were made to lie on the  floor while the\n\npolice initiated  a search  of the  apartment.   INS  Special\n\nAgent  Bernstein testified  that  he gave  defendants Miranda\n                                                             \n\nwarnings in Spanish.  In the  closet of the back bedroom, the\n\npolice  found approximately  ten  and  one-half  ounces  (295\n\ngrams) of suspected cocaine in one of several opaque  plastic\n\nbags  on the  closet's  floor.   The  substance later  tested\n\npositive  as  cocaine, and  was  valued  between $13,650  and\n\n$16,800.   Also in the  closet were articles  of clothing and\n\nscattered  papers,  including  a  bill  of  sale  and  a  car\n\nregistration in  the name of  Pablo Garcia registered  to the\n\naddress  of 93-95 Gallatin Street.   Under a  mattress in the\n\nfront room, the police discovered a passport for Pablo Garcia\n\nand a number of  notebooks with figures and names  that a DEA\n\nagent testified were  records of narcotics  dealing.  In  the\n\nbox spring  under the  mattress, the  police found  $1,308 in\n\ncash.   Finally,  on the  kitchen counter,  police discovered\n\nplastic ziploc  bags that had  been cut,  and a candle  and a\n\n                             -3-\n\nstrainer.  At  trial, DEA  agents testified  that these  were\n\npackaging materials for cocaine distribution. \n\n          The police took Pablo  and Jose separately into the\n\nroom where the cocaine had been found, and asked each of them\n\nto identify a piece of clothing that belonged to them.  Pablo\n\npicked out a shirt and jacket (later revealed to be a woman's\n\njacket).   Jose picked out a  shirt.  Also in  that room were\n\ntwo  mattresses, one of  which was propped  against the wall.\n\nThe  closet in the  back bedroom was  the only  closet in the\n\napartment.\n\n          Both   defendants  took  the  stand  at  trial  and\n\ntestified in  their own defense.   While admitting  that they\n\nboth slept in the room  in which the cocaine was  found, they\n\ndenied  knowing that there was  cocaine in the  closet.  Both\n\nalso  denied  knowing  of  the  presence  of  the other  drug\n\nparaphernalia  in the  apartment or  of any  drug trafficking\n\noperation.  \n\n          Defendants  presented  different  explanations  for\n\ntheir presence in the apartment.   Jose Garcia testified that\n\nhe had lived in the back room at  93-95 Gallatin Street since\n\nthe previous August or  September.  He said that  he had been\n\nin  Santo Domingo  from December 23,  1990 until  January 23,\n\n1991,  and that he  had spent a  few days in  New York before\n\nreturning  to Providence.    He returned  to find  that Pablo\n\nGarcia, whom  he had never  met, was  staying in the  room he\n\n                             -4-\n\nrented.   He testified that  he had been trying  to move from\n\nthe apartment when the arrest took place, and that he already\n\nhad moved many of his belongings to a friend's home.\n\n          Pablo Garcia  testified that he lived  in New York,\n\nbut had come to Providence in February to stand trial for his\n\narrest,  in  December 1990,  for  cocaine  trafficking.   The\n\ndistrict judge had, before Pablo testified, admitted evidence\n\nof this  prior arrest  as probative of  defendant's knowledge\n\nand  intent  to  commit   the  offenses  at  issue.     Pablo\n\nacknowledged  that  he was  a friend  of Oscar  Quinones, but\n\nmaintained that he did not know  Jose Garcia, and that he had\n\nno real control over the room or the apartment because he was\n\nonly temporarily residing there.  \n\n                             II.\n\n                 Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                                            \n\n          Defendants   both  appeal   the  denial   of  their\n\nrespective  motions for  judgment of  acquittal.1   Both were\n\nconvicted of  possessing and  conspiring  to possess  cocaine\n\nwith the intent  to distribute.   Defendants assert that  the\n\nprosecution failed to prove,  beyond a reasonable doubt, both\n\nknowing possession of the  cocaine and their participation in\n\na conspiracy to possess cocaine.\n\n                    \n\n1  Pablo  Garcia  and  Jose  Garcia  have  each  adopted,  by\nreference, the other's brief.

We assess the  sufficiency of the\n          evidence  as  a   whole,  including   all\n          reasonable inferences, in the  light most\n          favorable to the verdict,  with a view to\n          whether  a rational  trier of  fact could\n          have  found the defendant guilty beyond a\n          reasonable  doubt.     We  do  not  weigh\n          witness  credibility,   but  resolve  all\n          credibility  issues  in   favor  of   the\n          verdict.   The  evidence may  be entirely\n          circumstantial,  and   need  not  exclude\n          every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;\n          that is, the  factfinder may decide among\n          reasonable    interpretations   of    the\n          evidence.\n\nUnited States v.

In\n      \n\n                             -7-\n\nVargas,  a  search   warrant  was  executed  at   defendant's\n      \n\napartment when defendant was playing cards in a kitchen with,\n\namong  others,   an  alleged  co-conspirator.     The  search\n\nuncovered:  one kilogram of cocaine concealed behind a wooden\n\nbaseboard in  a bedroom  with the co-conspirator's  passport;\n\ndrug ledgers on top of a bureau and $2,400 in a jacket pocket\n\nin the only other  bedroom, and a narcotics notebook  in open\n\nview in the kitchen.  We affirmed both the possession and the\n\nconspiracy charges.  \n\n          On the  possession charge,  we held that  there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that\n\ndefendant  enjoyed  either  exclusive or  joint  dominion and\n\ncontrol of the apartment during the days preceding the police\n\nraid.  We found that  there was ample circumstantial evidence\n\nfor a finding that the cocaine was intended for distribution:\n\nfrom the quantity it was reasonable to infer that the cocaine\n\nwas not  merely for  personal consumption and  such inference\n\nwas  buttressed  by the  large amount  of  cash and  the drug\n\nrecords  in open view.  In language directly apposite to this\n\ncase, we  concluded that,  \"it would be  reasonable to  infer\n\nthat no non-occupant,  other than a confidant  of the tenant,\n\nwould  deposit a valuable cache of contraband in a bedroom of\n\nan unsuspecting tenant's apartment from which retrieval would\n\nbe much more difficult at best, and the risk of discovery and\n\nloss  far  greater, than  if  a more  accessible  and closely\n\n                             -8-\n\ncontrolled location were used or the  secret were shared with\n\nthe  tenant.\"  United States  v.  Vargas,  945  F.2d at  429.\n                                        \n\nSimilarly, the evidence in this case was sufficient to permit\n\na  rational  jury to  find that  both  Pablo Garcia  and Jose\n\nGarcia  constructively possessed  the  cocaine.    They  both\n\nshared  dominion and control over the  area where the cocaine\n\nwas found.   Both men admitted to living  in the second floor\n\napartment and to jointly occupying the rear bedroom where the\n\ncocaine was found; Jose exclusively for the prior five or six\n\nmonths,  and  both Pablo  and Jose  for the  week immediately\n\npreceding the raid.  At the time of the search, both told the\n\npolice  that the apartment was  where they lived.   After the\n\nsearch uncovered cocaine, both were separately taken into the\n\nbedroom and asked  to pick  out an article  of clothing  that\n\nbelonged to them, which they did.  Also found on the floor of\n\nthe  closet  along with  the  cocaine  were various  personal\n\npapers belonging  to Pablo, including  car registration forms\n\nregistered to  93-95 Gallatin  Street.  In  addition, Pablo's\n\npassport, concealed along  with a large  amount of money  and\n\nrecords of drug sales, was also found during  the search.  As\n\nwe stated in Vargas, \"[e]vidence sufficient to establish that\n                   \n\nthe accused  shared dominion and control of  the premises can\n\nserve  as   a  sufficient  basis  for   inferring  a  knowing\n\npossession of  contraband where the  evidence indicates  that\n\nthe  accused,  either alone  or  jointly  with  one  or  more\n\n                             -9-\n\npersons,  intended  to facilitate  the  possession.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Vargas, 945 F.2d at 428.  \n                \n\n          There was  also ample evidence from  which the jury\n\ncould  find  that the  cocaine  discovered  was intended  for\n\ndistribution.  The quantity of cocaine (295 grams), the large\n\namount of  cash, the drug records,  and cocaine paraphernalia\n\nin  plain view, were  all links in  a chain of  evidence from\n\nwhich intent  to  distribute cocaine  could  be found.

The search warrant  was issued by  a state court\n\njudge for the  state of  Rhode Island upon  the affidavit  of\n\nDetective Zammarelli.   That  affidavit, in  essence, stated:\n\nthat Detective Zammarelli had reason to believe that a large-\n\nscale  drug operation was  being conducted out  of the second\n\nfloor  apartment of 93-95 Gallatin Street; that he met with a\n\nreliable  confidential  informant  who  told  him  that   two\n\nHispanic  persons were  storing and  selling drugs;  that the\n\ninformant had seen large amounts of cocaine in the apartment;\n\nand   that,  to   corroborate  this   information,  Detective\n\nZammarelli executed a \"controlled buy\" through the informant.\n\nThe   affidavit  fully   described   the  \"controlled   buy.\"\n\nDetective Zammarelli reported  searching the informant  prior\n\nto the  buy and finding no contraband on him.  He stated that\n\nhe gave the informant a sum of U.S. currency, followed him to\n\nthe  apartment,  watched him  enter the  front door  of 93-95\n\nGallatin  Street, and observed  him exit a  few minutes later\n\nfrom  the same door.   Next, he stated  in the affidavit that\n\nthe informant then handed  Detective Zammarelli a quantity of\n\ncocaine, reporting  that he had purchased  the substance from\n\nthe Hispanic male who resided in the second floor apartment. \n\nDetective Zammarelli  stated that  he made another  search of\n\n                             -14-\n\nthe informant and found  no contraband.  Later,  upon testing\n\nthe substance,  Detective  Zammarelli confirmed  that it  was\n\ncocaine.\n\n          The   district  court  determined  that  there  was\n\nsufficient  probable   cause  stated  on  the   face  of  the\n\naffidavit,  finding  that  the information  provided  therein\n\nwould lead a  reasonable person to  believe that cocaine  was\n\nbeing sold from the second floor apartment.      \n\n          We  review the district  court's decision to uphold\n\nthe  warrant only for clear error.

More generally,  he argues that\n\nthis affidavit is the sort of \"bare bones\" affidavit that the\n\nSupreme Court criticized  in United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 915.  We disagree with both of these contentions.  \n\n          Detective Zammarelli confirmed the information with\n\nwhich the confidential informant provided him by carrying out\n\na carefully-executed \"controlled buy.\"  Given   its  greatest\n\nforce,  defendant's argument  against this  corroboration was\n\nthat  one  and  the same  informant  was  the  source of  the\n\ninformation and the  actor in the \"controlled  buy,\" and that\n\nthe  informant might  have stashed  cocaine elsewhere  in the\n\nbuilding  out   of  the  sight   of  the  detective.     This\n\npossibility, defendant  posits, undercuts the  reliability of\n\nthe informant.  Although defendant's argument is possible, it\n\nis  not  probable and  strains  credulity  on a  common-sense\n\nreading.  We find that both the issuing state court judge and\n\nthe district  judge drew  a reasonable inference  of probable\n\ncause that  there was  drug trafficking in  the second  floor\n\napartment  of 93-95 Gallatin Street.  We affirm the denial of\n\nthe motion to  suppress the evidence  seized pursuant to  the\n\nwarrant.\n\nB.

Detectives Della\n\nVentura  and Zammarelli were part  of the search  team at the\n\napartment's front door.   Detective  Della Ventura  testified\n\nthat  he knocked  loudly  on the  door  and shouted  \"Police,\n\nsearch warrant, open the door.\"   After waiting approximately\n\nten   seconds   without  receiving   a   response  (Detective\n\n                             -17-\n\nZammarelli estimated ten to fifteen seconds), the search team\n\nforcibly  entered the apartment.   Upon  entering, defendants\n\nwere immediately restrained.\n\n          At  the hearing,  defendant Pablo Garcia  sought to\n\nsuppress all evidence seized from  the apartment on the basis\n\nthat the execution of the warrant was conducted  in violation\n\nof  the \"knock  and announce\"  rule, 18  U.S.C.    31094, and\n\nsuch  violation rendered  the subsequent  search warrantless.\n\nPablo   Garcia  argued,  alternatively,   that  no  knock  or\n\nannouncement  was  made at  all;  that  the announcement  was\n\ninadequate when considering  the purpose of the rule;  or, if\n\nthe  announcement  was adequate,  that  the  ten second  wait\n\nbefore  forcibly entering was, as  a matter of  law, not long\n\nenough.\n\n          After  hearing  the  testimony  of the  two  police\n\nofficers who executed  the warrant and  of Pablo Garcia,  the\n\ndistrict  judge found that  the police  did loudly  knock and\n\nannounce  their presence  and purpose  as required,  and that\n\nthey entered the apartment  when they believed that  they had\n\nbeen  refused admission.   The  district judge  was satisfied\n\n                    \n\n4 18 U.S.C.   3109 states in pertinent part:\n          The officer  may break open any  outer or\n          inner door  or window of a  house, or any\n          part of a house, or  anything therein, to\n          execute  a  search  warrant,   if,  after\n          notice of his  authority and purpose,  he\n          is refused admittance  or when  necessary\n          to  liberate himself  or a  person aiding\n          him in the execution of the warrant.\n\n                             -18-\n\nthat,  in the context of a  drug raid where contraband can be\n\ndisposed  of within seconds,  the ten to  fifteen second wait\n\nwas  a reasonable period of time, and that the officers fully\n\ncomplied with the \"knock and announce\" rule.  \n\n          The  district  court's  findings  are  not  clearly\n\nerroneous.   Under the circumstances,  a wait of  ten seconds\n\nafter knocking  combined with  an announcement  before forced\n\nentry, was reasonable.  The  occupants of the apartment  were\n\nreasonably believed  to possess cocaine, a  substance that is\n\neasily and quickly hidden or destroyed.

As the\n\nsearch  commenced,  INS  Special  Agent  Bernstein  gave  the\n\n                             -19-\n\ndefendant Miranda warnings in Spanish.  He specifically asked\n                 \n\ndefendant if  he understood each right as it was read to him.\n\nAfter   each   such   question,   the   defendant   responded\n\naffirmatively.   After advising  defendant of his  rights and\n\nbeing told  by the defendant  that he understood  them, Agent\n\nBernstein asked  the defendant if  he was  willing to  answer\n\nsome  questions   without  the   presence  of   an  attorney.\n\nDefendant  agreed  and  told  the  officer  he  would  answer\n\nquestions.    Agent  Bernstein  then  asked  defendant  basic\n\ninformational questions, such as where he lived.  The answers\n\nto some of the questions were incriminating.  \n\n          After  the discovery  of  the cocaine  in the  rear\n\nbedroom, Agent Bernstein took  the defendant, alone, into the\n\nbedroom  and  asked him  if  any  clothing belonged  to  him.\n\nDefendant  responded  affirmatively.   Agent  Bernstein  then\n\nasked  him  to  point out  something  that  was  his.   Being\n\nhandcuffed, defendant motioned with his head to a shirt and a\n\njacket.   Agent Bernstein identified the shirt and jacket and\n\nasked  defendant  if  they   were  his;  defendant   answered\n\naffirmatively.5\n\n          At the suppression hearing, Pablo Garcia had sought\n\nto suppress the incriminating  statements and actions he made\n\nduring  the search of the  apartment on the  ground that they\n\n                    \n\n5  Special Agent  Bernstein's  treatment of  Jose Garcia  was\nsubstantially the same, and the same analysis applies. \n\n                             -20-\n\nwere  made  without an  intelligent,  knowing,  and voluntary\n\nwaiver  of his Fifth Amendment rights.  Defendant argued that\n\nthe officer was required to  specifically advise him that his\n\nanswers to the informational  questions could be used against\n\nhim, and because he was never  so advised, he could not  have\n\nknowingly waived  his rights.  In  addition, defendant argued\n\nthat the warnings were  inadequate because the officer should\n\nhave  advised defendant that  anything he  did could  be used\n                                              \n\nagainst  him, and  that defendant  had a  right to  refuse to\n\npoint out such clothing that belonged to him.\n\n          When an individual is taken into custody and before\n\ninterrogation,  Miranda  requires   that  the  individual  be\n                       \n\nadvised:   that  he  has the  right  to remain  silent;  that\n\nanything he  says may be used  against him in court;  that he\n\nhas  the right  to  consult an  attorney  before being  asked\n\nquestions;  that   the   attorney  may   be  present   during\n\nquestioning;  and that if  he cannot afford  an attorney, one\n\nwill be appointed for him if he wishes.

Background\n              \n\n          This  final issue  is the most  difficult one.

We\n\nfirst  rehearse  in extenso  what  happened  in the  district\n                           \n\ncourt.\n\n          Prior to trial, defendant Pablo Garcia requested  a\n\nruling from the district  court as to whether it  would admit\n\nevidence  under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)6 of his prior arrest for\n\ndealing in  cocaine.   The  court deferred  ruling until  the\n\nevidence became relevant at trial.\n\n          At the  start of the  trial, but before  the jurors\n\nwere in the courtroom, the attorney for Pablo Garcia (Francis\n\nJ. Gillan, III) requested that the government  not be allowed\n\nto mention the 404(b)  evidence in its opening and  that none\n\nof  the  witnesses be  allowed to  testify as  to defendant's\n\nprior arrest until  the court had ruled on  the admissibility\n\n                    \n\n6 Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides that:\n          Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\n          is  not admissible to prove the character\n          of a  person in  order to show  action in\n          conformity therewith.   It may,  however,\n          be admissible for other purposes, such as\n          proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\n          preparation,  plan, knowledge,  identity,\n          or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n                             -24-\n\nof  the evidence.    The prosecutor  stated  that he  had  no\n\nintention of  referring to  the evidence in  his opening  and\n\nthat  he  would  instruct  his witness  not  to  mention  the\n\nprevious arrest.  The court then stated that there would be a\n\nhearing on  the question  in the absence  of the jury  at the\n\ntime the prosecutor wished to introduce the evidence.\n\n          Counsel  for the  defendant  Jose  Garcia (John  M.\n\nCicilline),  then informed the  court that  he might  want to\n\nelicit  testimony as to the  prior arrest of  Pablo Garcia in\n\ncross-examination of government witnesses.  The court  stated\n\nthat he would rule on the question at the appropriate time.\n\n          After the trial had progressed, Attorney Cicilline,\n\ncounsel for Jose Garcia, informed the court that he wanted to\n\nelicit testimony about Pablo  Garcia's prior arrest in cross-\n\nexamination of the next government witness, a DEA agent.  The\n\ncourt  then  held a  hearing  on  the  admissibility  of  the\n\nevidence.\n\n          After hearing Attorney Cicilline on the question of\n\nrelevancy, the court heard argument by Attorney Gillan, Pablo\n\nGarcia's attorney,  as  to why  the  evidence should  not  be\n\nadmitted.   The prosecutor then advised the court that he was\n\nnot  going to offer the  evidence through the  DEA agent, but\n\nthat he intended  to offer testimony on  Pablo Garcia's prior\n\narrest by  a detective  on the Providence  Police Department.\n\nThe detective would testify that, within the last six months,\n\n                             -25-\n\nhe  had  arrested  Pablo Garcia  on  a  cocaine charge  after\n\npersonally  witnessing the transaction  in which Pablo Garcia\n\nwas involved.\n\n          During the course of the argument by Pablo Garcia's\n\nattorney, the court commented:\n\n               Well, one of  the requirements  that\n          the  government must prove  is that there\n          was possession, number 1, and number two,\n          that   it  was   was   [sic]  a   knowing\n          possession.  So, doesn't this evidence go\n          to   question   [sic]   of  whether   the\n          possession was knowing?\n\nAfter hearing further argument  by Pablo Garcia's counsel the\n\ncourt ruled:\n\n               Well, I  think the rule is clear, as\n          has been explicated by the  First Circuit\n          with  the one  exception that  I referred\n          to,  that   this  kind  of   evidence  is\n          admissible  as  proof of  motive, intent,\n          plan, knowledge, in  this kind of  a case\n          where there's a charge of possession with\n          intent to distribute, and also,  a charge\n          of  conspiracy. . .  .   It's admissible.\n          The prosecution  can put  it in.   So, if\n          the prosecution doesn't choose to  put it\n          in, one of the other defendants can bring\n          it out.\n\n          Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  Rule  404(b)\n\ntestimony that the court had ruled would be admissible, Pablo\n\nGarcia's  attorney  tried again  to  have  it excluded.    He\n\nstated, inter alia:\n                  \n\n               Number  1, your Honor  had said that\n          this  evidence  was important  because it\n          would   go   to   issue  of   intent   to\n          distribute.    A  prior  sale  equals  an\n          intent  to  distribute on  this occasion.\n          With  that  in   mind,  your  Honor,  and\n\n                             -26-\n\n          reading Rubio Estrada  again last  night,\n          where  the Court  had  said  that     had\n          mentioned the facts [sic] that intent was\n          important.  I would  respectfully suggest\n          that if intent was at issue, based on the\n          testimony we heard  from Detective  Della\n          Ventura  and  thus  far   from  Detective\n          Zammarelli, I wouldn't contest  intent to\n          distribute, insofar as there is more than\n          ample  evidence  that  whoever  possessed\n          that  cocaine,  possessed  it   with  the\n          intent to distribute.  So, if the  404(b)\n          evidence goes to the intention of someone\n          to  distribute  that  cocaine,   I  would\n          suggest, your  Honor,  that if  the  jury\n          finds  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that\n          Pablo  Garcia  possessed,  did   in  fact\n          possess  that  cocaine,   then  I   would\n          stipulate  that they can find from there,\n          that  he did  so  with  the intention  to\n          distribute that cocaine.\n\n          After   counsel's   further   argument  on   unfair\n\nprejudice the following colloquy took place:\n\n               THE COURT:   It may be.   It may be.\n          And  people in  your  position  say  it's\n          unfair  prejudice.    I  say,  it's  fair\n          prejudice  because   it's  fair  evidence\n          against  this  defendant  because  he  is\n          being  charged  with knowing  possession,\n          and that's  an issue in this  case.  He's\n          going  to tell  us, and  you're going  to\n          argue  to the jury, that he just happened\n          to  be  there, wrong  place at  the wrong\n          time, doesn't know anything about cocaine\n          trafficking.\n\n               Mr.   GILLAN:  No, I  don't say that\n          he  doesn't  know anything  about cocaine\n          trafficking, just that he's  not involved\n          in this enterprise.\n\n               THE  COURT:    Well,  this  evidence\n          indicates that he is.\n\n               MR. GILLAN:  Thank you, your Honor.\n\n                             -27-\n\n               THE  COURT:   And  that's  why  it's\n          relevant,  and  that's why  it's properly\n          admissible under the  rule because  there\n          is an issue of knowing possession . . .\n\n          Detective  Zammarelli  testified  that, two  months\n\nprior to the arrest  of Jose Garcia and Pablo  Garcia, he and\n\nDetective  Della Ventura  (also  involved in  the arrests  of\n\nPablo  and Jose)  arrested Pablo  Garcia  in Providence  at a\n\ndifferent location.   Detective Zammarelli testified  that he\n\nobserved, through a large glass window, three men engaged  in\n\ndiscussion.   One  of the  men handed  money to  another, who\n\nbegan  to  speak with  the third  man,  Pablo Garcia.   Pablo\n\nGarcia then  walked out  of Detective Zammarelli's  view, and\n\nreturned to hand  a bag of suspected cocaine  to the man from\n\nwhom  he obtained  money.   Detective Zammarelli,  along with\n\nDetective Della Ventura, then arrested the  three men.  Pablo\n\nGarcia  was charged  with  unlawful delivery  of cocaine  and\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Immediately   after   this  testimony,   the  court\n\ninstructed the jury:\n\n          . .  .  Mr.  Foreman and  members of  the\n          jury,  sometimes  evidence is  admissible\n          for  one purpose, but it's not admissible\n          for another  purpose.  So, the  Court has\n          to allow  the  evidence in  because  it's\n          relevant on some point  in the case.  But\n          I have to advise you, as jurors, that you\n          can't consider it on some other  point in\n          the case.\n\n               The rule of evidence that's involved\n          is  rule  404(b) which  relates  to other\n          crimes or wrongs, prior bad  acts as it's\n\n                             -28-\n\n          often  referred  to.   Evidence  of other\n          crimes, wrongs or  acts is not admissible\n          to prove  the  character of  a person  in\n          order  to  show   action  in   conformity\n          therewith.      It   may,   however,   be\n          admissible  for  other  purposes such  as\n          proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\n          preparation,  plan, knowledge,  identity,\n          or  absence  of   mistake  or   accident.\n          That's the rule.   What it means is that,\n          in a  criminal trial  for an  offense you\n          can't   bring   in   evidence  of   other\n          offenses, just to show that the defendant\n          is  a bad  person and  is likely  to have\n          committed  this  offense.     That's  not\n          admissible for that purpose.  However, it\n          is admissible to show knowledge or intent\n          or motive or plan.  \n\n               I have  ruled that this  evidence is\n          admissible  in  this  case against  Pablo\n          Garcia because two  of the issues in  the\n          case  relate  to  his knowledge  and  his\n          intent.   First  of all,  he has  to have\n          knowing possession of the cocaine in this\n          case, and  also, he is  charged with  not\n          only  knowing  possession but  possession\n          with  intent to distribute.  And so, this\n          evidence relates to  his knowledge  about\n          cocaine   and    whether   he   knowingly\n          possessed   it   in  that   apartment  on\n          Gallatin   Street,   and   also,  if   he\n          possessed  it,  whether  he possessed  it\n          with intent to distribute.\n\n               So, you may  consider this  evidence\n          or  prior  acts by  the  defendant, Pablo\n          Garcia,  only  on  the  question  of  his\n          knowledge  and intent  in this  case; and\n          the  government has the burden of proving\n          those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis  instruction  was given  in  abridged form  in  the jury\n\ncharge.   It  is  to be  noted  that the  prosecutor did  not\n\nmention the prior arrest in his closing argument.\n\n                             -29-\n\n          On appeal, defendant argues that the district court\n\nerred  in  admitting the  404(b)  evidence  for two  reasons.\n\nFirst, defendant contends that it was impermissible  evidence\n\nof  bad  character  and  that it  was  unfairly  prejudicial.\n\nSecond, defendant argues that  the district court should have\n\naccepted his  attempt to foreclose admission  of the evidence\n\nby  offering to concede the issues of intent and knowledge to\n\nwhich  the evidence was directed.  We begin by addressing the\n\nadmissibility of the evidence. \n\nB.  Admissibility of the Evidence  \nB.  Admissibility of the Evidence\n                                 \n\n          Evidence of  prior bad acts is admissible, pursuant\n\nto   Fed.  R.

The trial judge first determines\n\nwhether  the  evidence  has  some \"special\"  probative  value\n\nshowing intent, preparation, knowledge or absence of mistake.\n\nSee United States  v.

In  Flores Perez, we observed\n                                                \n\nthat where the  404(b) evidence is  probative of issues  like\n\nintent  and knowledge,  the prohibition against  admission of\n\ncharacter  evidence is construed broadly.

Pablo Garcia was arrested\n\nonly two months earlier by two of the  same officers who made\n\nthe arrest  precipitating the current charges.   The previous\n\narrest  was for dealing in  cocaine, an act  which is similar\n\nand has  special relevance to  the charge of  possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine.

This case\n                         \n\ndoes not present any such exceptional circumstances.\n\n          We  note  that  the  evidence  involved  an arrest,\n\nrather  than  a  conviction, and  involved  two  of  the same\n\nofficers  who  participated  in  the arrest  leading  to  the\n\ncharges  at  issue.    These circumstances  might  well  have\n\nexaggerated the prejudicial effects of the evidence, a factor\n\nnot   explicitly   addressed    by   the   district    court.\n\nNevertheless,  Rule  404(b) covers  prior  acts,  and is  not\n                                               \n\nlimited  to convictions.  From  our review of  the record, we\n\nare satisfied that there  was sufficient evidence linking the\n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\ndefendant  to the prior act.   Moreover, the  fact that Pablo\n\nGarcia  was only arrested, and  had not been   convicted, was\n\nexplained to the jury.    \n\n          Lastly, the district  court handled the  prior acts\n\nevidence  with  care,  providing  the jury  with  a  limiting\n\ninstruction  after  the  evidence  was  admitted,  and  again\n\ninstructing the jury of  the scope of prior acts  evidence in\n\nhis final charge.  \n\nC.  Defendant's Offers to Concede Knowledge and Intent\n                                                      \n\n          Having found the prior acts evidence admissible, we\n\nnow  address  defendant's  argument  that,   because  he  had\n\nconceded  the elements of  knowledge and intent  to which the\n\nevidence  was directed,  the  evidence should  not have  been\n\nadmitted.  In support  of his claim, defendant points  to two\n\nstatements  made by defense counsel prior to the admission of\n\nthe  evidence.   With  respect  to  the issue  of  knowledge,\n\ndefendant   highlights  an  unelaborated  statement  made  in\n\nresponse to the court's  discussion of the prejudicial impact\n\nof the evidence  that, \"No, I don't say that  he doesn't know\n\nanything about cocaine trafficking. . . .\"   With  respect to\n\nthe issue of intent, defendant points to  his counsel's offer\n\nto stipulate to  the intent  to distribute in  the event  the\n\njury found that Pablo Garcia, in fact, possessed the cocaine.\n\n(We excerpted the context surrounding these statements in our\n\ndiscussion  of the  background on  this issue,  supra.)   The\n                                                     \n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\ncombination   of  these  two  statements,  defendant  argues,\n\nconstituted  a  clear  offer  to  concede  that  he  had  the\n\nrequisite knowledge  and intent  to possess the  cocaine, and\n\nthe  specific  intent to  distribute  it,  if the  government\n\nproved that he possessed it.  For the reasons that follow, we\n\nfind  that  the  defendant   failed  sufficiently  to  remove\n\nknowledge  and intent from the case, and that the trial judge\n\ndid not err in admitting the evidence despite the defendant's\n\nstated concessions.\n\n          Defendant relies upon our decision in United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Counsel had addressed  each of the court's  concerns\n\nand  had stated  \"unequivocally,\"  \"'[t]here is  no issue  of\n\nintent.'\" United States  v. Figueroa,  618 F.2d at  940.   By\n                                    \n\ncontrast,   in  Ferrer-Cruz,   we  determined   that  defense\n                           \n\ncounsel's  response to the judge that he was not arguing mere\n\npresence  did not  amount  to  a  clear offer  to  stipulate.\n\nUnited  States v. Ferrer-Cruz, 899 F.2d at 139.  In addition,\n                             \n\nwe found that,  far from  having removed the  issue from  the\n\ncase, the defense counsel  had actually argued mere presence.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          To prevent  the admission  of bad acts  evidence, a\n\ndefendant's offer to concede  knowledge and/or intent  issues\n\nmust  do two things.   First, the offer  must express a clear\n\nand unequivocal intention to remove  the issues such that, in\n                         \n\neffect  if not in form, it constitutes an offer to stipulate.\n\nSecond,  notwithstanding  the  sincerity  of  the defendant's\n\noffer, the  concession must cover  the necessary  substantive\n\nground  to remove the issues  from the case.   See generally,\n                                                            \n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n\nUnited  States v.  Colon, 880  F.2d at  658 (where  the court\n                        \n\ndetermined that the stipulation the defendant presented, even\n\nif proffered  with sincerity, failed  to remove the  issue of\n\nintent from the case).\n\n          We begin  our analysis  by noting  that it  was not\n\nonly the  government which  requested the admission  of Pablo\n\nGarcia's prior  arrest, but  defendant Jose Garcia,  as well.\n\nThe  two  statements of  concession raise  somewhat different\n\nconcerns, and we address each in turn.\n\n          We  do  not  believe  that  the  defense  counsel's\n\nstatement as to Pablo  Garcia's knowledge of drug trafficking\n\namounted to an attempt  to stipulate, nor do we  believe that\n\nit removed knowledge from the case.  First, the statement did\n\nnot rise to the level of  a clear offer to concede knowledge.\n\nIt was no  more than a  single response, among others,  in an\n\nongoing  discussion  with  the  court  about the  prejudicial\n\nimpact of  the  evidence.   By contrast  with the  successful\n\ndefendants in  both Figueroa  and Mohel, defense  counsel did\n                                       \n\nnot pursue this concession  with the court at that  time, nor\n\ndid  he raise it  again.  See United  States v. Figueroa, 618\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 940  (where defense  counsel vigorously  pursued his\n\nconcessions with the court); United States v.

At  best,  defense counsel's  statement may  be\n\nconstrued  as an  offer not  to argue  that defendant  had no\n                                     \n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\nknowledge of the  workings of drug  trafficking.

Ferrer-Cruz, 899\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 139.8 \n\n          Second,  defense  counsel's   statement  of   Pablo\n\nGarcia's relative knowledge about cocaine trafficking was not\n\nthe sort of concession which the trial judge reasonably could\n\nbe  expected  to assume  would  remove  the entire  issue  of\n\nknowledge from this case.  At most, it was a limited offer to\n\n                    \n\n8 Courts which  permit the foreclosure of 404(b)  evidence by\nconcession   or  stipulation   generally  require   that  the\ndefendant  be willing to accept  a jury charge  to the effect\nthat the issue  has been  removed from the  case.  See  e.g.,\n                                                            \nUnited States  v. Colon, 880 F.2d  at 659;  United  States v.\n                                                          \nFigueroa,  618 F.2d at  942.  Exactly  who has  the duty, the\n        \ndefense counsel or the court, to suggest such an instruction,\nhowever, remains unclear.  Figueroa seems to suggest that, so\n                                   \nlong  as  the  defendant  raises the  issue  with  sufficient\nclarity,  the judge must then remove the issue from the case,\nby disallowing  subsequent cross-examination,  and by  a jury\ncharge.  See United States v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d at 942.  Our\n                                      \ndecision in Ferrer-Cruz places the burden more clearly on the\n                       \ndefendant, as evident  in the above-cited  excerpt.  In  this\ncase, we do not need to  reach the issue because we find that\ndefendant's  statement  was  not  a  clear  offer  to  remove\nknowledge from the case.  We merely instruct that an offer to\nconcede  an  issue which  also asks  for  a jury  charge will\nappear  more sincere  and unequivocal,  and will  assist both\ntrial and reviewing courts in assessing such concession.  \n\n                             -38-\n                              38\n\nforeclose certain  inferences that the jury  might have drawn\n\nas to knowledge.  \n\n          Finally, knowledge  remained a focal  issue in  the\n\ncase, and  one vigorously contested by the  defendant.  Pablo\n\nGarcia's defense was  that he did not know of the presence of\n                                          \n\nthe cocaine in  the closet of the  room he inhabited.   Pablo\n\nGarcia also argued that  he did not  know of the presence  of\n\nthe drug paraphernalia that was  openly visible in the  small\n\napartment.    \n\n          We  turn   next  to  defense   counsel's  offer  to\n\nstipulate  to intent to distribute.  By contrast with defense\n\ncounsel's   statement  as   to   knowledge,  this   statement\n\nconstituted a clear and unequivocal offer to stipulate to one\n\nessential  element  of the  case:    the specific  intent  to\n\ndistribute.  Conceding the  specific intent to distribute did\n\nnot, however, affect  the relevance of  the evidence to  show\n\ndefendant's  knowledge and  intent  to possess  the  cocaine.\n\nDefense  counsel conceded  intent to  distribute if  the jury\n\nfound  possession.    Because there  remained  an independent\n\nbasis for admission of the\n\nevidence--the defendant's knowledge and intent to possess\n\nthe cocaine--the district court did not err in its failure to\n\nconsider the defendant's offer to stipulate in this instance.\n\n                             -39-\n                              39\n\n          The  effect  of stipulations  on  the  admission of\n\n404(b)  evidence  is confronting  us  more  frequently.   We,\n\ntherefore,  proffer some  guidance in  this area.   We  note,\n\nfirst of all, that a serious offer to concede or stipulate to\n\nissues of intent  and/or knowledge should be  explored by the\n\ndistrict court.  In the final analysis, however, whether such\n\nan offer is accepted  remains in the sound discretion  of the\n\ndistrict  judge.  If the  judge determines that  the offer is\n\nacceptable, the  judge should take  steps to assure  that the\n\ndefendant  is aware of the contents of the stipulation and of\n\nits  implications  before  directing  the jury  that  it  may\n\nresolve the issue against the defendant.  \n\n          Second,   from  a   survey  of   the  circuits   on\n\nstipulations  in  the  area   of  404(b)  evidence,  we  have\n\nascertained  a  preference  for  handling the  matter  before\n\ntrial,  or  early in  the trial  process.
