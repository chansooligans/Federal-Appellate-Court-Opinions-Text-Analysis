The  Court reasoned  that the\n               \n\nremedial  limitations  imposed by  Congress in  admiralty actions\n\npredicated  on negligence likewise  restrict an admiralty court's\n\npower  to fashion damages  remedies in actions  under the general\n\nmaritime law, such as the present unseaworthiness claim against a\n\nvessel where liability may be imposed without establishing fault.\n\nSee  Seas Shipping  Co. v.  Sieracki, 328  U.S. 85,  94-95 (1946)\n                                    \n\n(noting unseaworthiness  \"is essentially  a species  of liability\n\nwithout fault\").  Thus, the  admiralty court's remedial  autonomy\n\nis \"both direct[ed]  and delimit[ed]\" by federal  statute, Miles,\n                                                                \n\n498  U.S. at 27, insofar  as Congress has  spoken directly to the\n\npoint in  issue, id.  at 31,  citing Mobil  Oil Corp.  v. Higgin-\n                                                                 \n\nbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 (1978).\n      \n\n          Two statutes are directly  relevant to general maritime\n\nclaims based on  fatal injury:   the Death on  the High Seas  Act\n                      \n\n(DOHSA), 46  U.S.C.   761, et seq., and  the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.\n                                  \n\n  688, both enacted in 1920.  DOHSA makes specific provision only\n\n                                3\n                                 \n\nfor the  recovery of damages for  pecuniary loss.   See 46 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n\n  762 (\"The recovery . . . shall  be a fair and just compensation\n\nfor the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit\n\nthe  suit is brought  . . . .\").  Notwithstanding  that the fatal\n\ninjury at issue in Miles did not take place on the high seas, the\n                        \n\nSupreme Court considered DOHSA indicative of congressional intent\n\nin cases involving fatal injuries to seamen in territorial waters\n\nas well.  Miles, 498 U.S. at 31.\n               \n\n          Since the  Jones Act does  afford a right of  action to\n\ndependents  of seamen fatally  injured in territorial  waters, it\n\nformed the  principal focus of  inquiry in Miles.   The Jones Act\n                                                \n\nsimply incorporated by reference the remedial  scheme established\n\ntwelve years  earlier under  the Federal  Employee Liability  Act\n\n(FELA), 46  U.S.C.   688.   FELA, the  progenitor of  all federal\n\nliability  schemes, simultaneously  afforded a  uniform  cause of\n\naction  for  railroad  workers  and  dispensed  with  traditional\n\nmaster-and-servant defenses.   See  generally Rogers  v. Missouri\n                                                                 \n\nPac.  R. Co., 352 U.S. 500 (1957).   FELA's language is unhelpful\n            \n\non  its  face, however,  as  it  simply provides  for  \"damages,\"\n\nwithout further elaboration.  45 U.S.C.   51.\n\n          This  seeming  dead-end  is  averted, nevertheless,  by\n\nCongress's adoption and incorporation, in  the Jones Act, of  the\n\nremedial  scheme previously established  under FELA.   The courts\n                           \n\nmay assume that  Congress, at the time it enacted  the Jones Act,\n\nwas cognizant of  the decisional law developed under  FELA during\n\nthe twelve-year  interim between the  enactment of the  two stat-\n\n                                4\n                                 \n\nutes.   Miles, 498 U.S. at 32; see generally Cannon v. University\n                                                                 \n\nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677,  696-97 (1979) (\"It is always appropri-\n          \n\nate  to assume  that  our  elected  representatives,  like  other\n\ncitizens, know the law . . . .\").\n\n          The  Miles  Court  relied extensively  on  just  such a\n                    \n\ndecision,  see Michigan  Cent. R.  Co. v.  Vreeland, 227  U.S. 59\n                                                   \n\n(1913),  which revealed  yet another  evolutionary  layer in  the\n\ndevelopment of wrongful death statutes:\n\n              In  [Vreeland] the  Court explained  that\n                           \n          the language of the FELA wrongful death  pro-\n          vision  is essentially  identical to  that of\n          Lord  Campbell's Act,  9 &amp;  10  Vict. ch.  93\n          (1846),  the  first wrongful  death  statute.\n          Lord Campbell's  Act also  did not limit  ex-\n                              \n          plicitly the \"damages\"  to be recovered,  but\n          that  Act and  the many  state statutes  that\n          followed it consistently had been interpreted\n                                                       \n          as  providing  recovery  only  for  pecuniary\n                                                       \n          loss.\n              \n\nMiles, 498 U.S. at 32 (emphasis added), citing Vreeland, 227 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 69-71.   Finally, the Miles Court retraced  the development of\n                              \n\nwrongful  death statutes  into  the  Twentieth  Century  and  the\n\nmeaning of the unelaborated FELA term \"damages\" became clear:\n\n          When  Congress  passed  the  Jones  Act,  the\n          Vreeland gloss on FELA,  and the hoary tradi-\n                  \n          tion behind  it, were well  established.  In-\n          corporating  FELA  unaltered into  the  Jones\n          Act, Congress must have  intended to incorpo-\n          rate the  pecuniary limitation on  damages as\n          well.   We assume  that Congress is  aware of\n          existing  law  when  it  passes  legislation.\n          There is no recovery for loss of society in a\n          Jones Act wrongful death action.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          Uniformity  provided  the companion  rationale  for the\n\nMiles decision.   See Moragne  v. States Marine Lines,  Inc., 398\n                                                            \n\n                                5\n                                 \n\nU.S. 375, 402 (1970) (\"admiralty  law should be 'a system  of law\n\ncoextensive  with,   and  operating   uniformly  in,   the  whole\n\ncountry.'\"  (quoting The Lottawanna, 88  U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 575\n                                   \n\n(1875))).  As noted, damages  awarded under DOHSA are  restricted\n\nto pecuniary  loss.   Miles cautions  that  the traditional  gap-\n                           \n\nfilling function of  the admiralty court is to  be exercised only\n\nin furtherance of the presumed congressional objective of unifor-\n\nmity:\n\n          We no  longer live in an era  when seamen and\n          their loved  ones must look  primarily to the\n          courts as a source  of substantive legal pro-\n          tection from injury  and death; Congress  and\n          the  States  have legislated  extensively  in\n          these areas.

At  the outset, we note\n\ndistinctions  pertinent to  our inquiry.

Horsley and his wife, Elizabeth Horsley, allege that he sustained a back injury in the course of his duties aboard a vessel owned by defendant-appellee Mobil Oil Corporation while operating in the territorial waters of the Gulf of Maine.  Their unseaworthiness action involves, inter alia, claims for punitive damages by Jonathan C. Horsley;  and damages for loss of parental society by their minor son and loss of spousal society by Elizabeth Horsley.  The district court entered summary judgment for Mobil on all three claims.  825 F.Supp. 424 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has decided that damages for loss of society are not cognizable in a general maritime action for the wrongful death of a seaman, because \"[i]t would be inconsistent with [the Supreme Court's] place in the constitutional scheme were we to sanction more expansive remedies in a judicially-created cause of action in which liability is without fault than Congress has allowed in cases of death resulting from negligence.\"  Miles, 498 U.S. at 33, 111 S.Ct. at 326.   The Court reasoned that the remedial limitations imposed by Congress in admiralty actions predicated on negligence likewise restrict an admiralty court's power to fashion damages remedies in actions under the general maritime law, such as the present unseaworthiness claim against a vessel where liability may be imposed without establishing fault.  See Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 94-95, 66 S.Ct. 872, 877, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) (noting unseaworthiness \"is essentially a species of liability without fault\").  Thus, the admiralty court's remedial autonomy is \"both direct[ed] and delimit[ed]\" by federal statute, Miles, 498 U.S. at 27, 111 S.Ct. at 323, insofar as Congress has spoken directly to the point in issue, id. at 31, 111 S.Ct. at 325, citing Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625, 98 S.Ct. 2010, 2015, 56 L.Ed.2d 581 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two statutes are directly relevant to general maritime claims based on fatal injury:  the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 761, et seq., and the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 688, both enacted in 1920.  DOHSA makes specific provision only for the recovery of damages for pecuniary loss.  See 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 762 (\"The recovery ... shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought....\").  Notwithstanding that the fatal injury at issue in Miles did not take place on the high seas, the Supreme Court considered DOHSA indicative of congressional intent in cases involving fatal injuries to seamen in territorial waters as well.  Miles, 498 U.S. at 31, 111 S.Ct. at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Jones Act does afford a right of action to dependents of seamen fatally injured in territorial waters, it formed the principal focus of inquiry in Miles.   The Jones Act simply incorporated by reference the remedial scheme established twelve years earlier under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 688.  FELA, the progenitor of all federal liability schemes, simultaneously afforded a uniform cause of action for railroad workers and dispensed with traditional master-and-servant defenses.  See generally Rogers v. Missouri Pac.  R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957).  FELA's language is unhelpful on its face, however, as it simply provides for \"damages,\" without further elaboration.  45 U.S.C. Sec. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This seeming dead-end is averted, nevertheless, by Congress's adoption and incorporation, in the Jones Act, of the remedial scheme previously established under FELA.  The courts may assume that Congress, at the time it enacted the Jones Act, was cognizant of the decisional law developed under FELA during the twelve-year interim between the enactment of the two statutes.  Miles, 498 U.S. at 32, 111 S.Ct. at 325;  see generally Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1957-58, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\"It is always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Miles Court relied extensively on just such a decision, see Michigan Cent.

Lord Campbell's Act also did not limit explicitly the \"damages\" to be recovered, but that Act and the many state statutes that followed it consistently had been interpreted as providing recovery only for pecuniary loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miles, 498 U.S. at 32, 111 S.Ct. at 325 (emphasis added), citing Vreeland, 227 U.S. at 69-71, 33 S.Ct. at 195.   Finally, the Miles Court retraced the development of wrongful death statutes into the Twentieth Century and the meaning of the unelaborated FELA term \"damages\" became clear:When Congress passed the Jones Act, the Vreeland gloss on FELA, and the hoary tradition behind it, were well established.  Incorporating FELA unaltered into the Jones Act, Congress must have intended to incorporate the pecuniary limitation on damages as well.  We assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.  There is no recovery for loss of society in a Jones Act wrongful death action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uniformity provided the companion rationale for the Miles decision.  See Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375, 402, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 1788, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970) (\"admiralty law should be 'a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country.' \"  (quoting The Lottawanna, 88 U.S.  (21 Wall.) 558, 575, 22 L.Ed. 654 (1875))).  As noted, damages awarded under DOHSA are restricted to pecuniary loss.  Miles cautions that the traditional gap-filling function of the admiralty court is to be exercised only in furtherance of the presumed congressional objective of uniformity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>We no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death;  Congress and the States have legislated extensively in these areas.  In this era, an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.  We may supplement these statutory remedies where doing so would achieve the uniform vindication of such policies consistent with our constitutional mandate, but we must also keep strictly within the limits imposed by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miles, 498 U.S. at 27, 111 S.Ct. at 323 (emphasis added).  Thus, Miles \"restore[d] a uniform rule applicable to all actions for the wrongful death of a seaman, whether under DOHSA, the Jones Act, or the general maritime law[,]\" by limiting damages in wrongful death actions to the amount of pecuniary loss.

See also Smith v. Trinidad Corp., 992 F.2d 996 (9th Cir.1993) (adopting Murray reasoning) (per curiam);  and Lollie v. Brown Marine Serv., Inc., 995 F.2d 1565 (11th Cir.1993) (same).

At the outset, we note distinctions pertinent to our inquiry.  First, since DOHSA is inapplicable to nonfatal injuries sustained by a seaman aboard a vessel operating in territorial waters, it has no direct bearing on the damages remedies presently at issue.  Accordingly, whatever direct analogic bearing DOHSA had in Miles is diminished in the present context.  Second, as concerns the Jones Act, Vreeland is inapposite to the availability of damages for non pecuniary loss in cases involving non fatal injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Miles methodology takes us beyond Vreeland, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Igneri v.

The policy of the Federal Employees Liability Act, the regime which the Jones Act made applicable to seamen, was that the new remedy for the employee was to be exclusive and that claims of relatives recognized by state law were to be abrogated;  the FELA had been thus authoritatively construed before the Jones Act was passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Igneri, 323 F.2d at 266 (emphasis added), citing New York Cent. &amp; H.

Finally, the thrust of the Supreme Court's holding in Tonsellito is that FELA affords a remedy to injured workers--and only to workers, not to their relatives:  \"Congress having declared when, how far, and to whom carriers shall be liable on account of accidents in the specified class, such liability can neither be extended nor abridged....\"  New York Cent. &amp; H.

The Court reasoned that the remedial limitations imposed by Congress in admiralty actions predicated on negligence likewise restrict an admiralty court's power to fashion damages remedies in actions under the general maritime law, such as the present unseaworthiness claim against a vessel where liability may be imposed without establishing fault.

DOHSA makes specific provision only for the recovery of damages for pecuniary loss.  See 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 762 (\"The recovery ... shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought....\").  Notwithstanding that the fatal injury at issue in Miles did not take place on the high seas, the Supreme Court considered DOHSA indicative of congressional intent in cases involving fatal injuries to seamen in territorial waters as well.  Miles, 498 U.S. at 31, 111 S.Ct. at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Jones Act does afford a right of action to dependents of seamen fatally injured in territorial waters, it formed the principal focus of inquiry in Miles.   The Jones Act simply incorporated by reference the remedial scheme established twelve years earlier under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 688.  FELA, the progenitor of all federal liability schemes, simultaneously afforded a uniform cause of action for railroad workers and dispensed with traditional master-and-servant defenses.

Finally, the Miles Court retraced the development of wrongful death statutes into the Twentieth Century and the meaning of the unelaborated FELA term \"damages\" became clear:When Congress passed the Jones Act, the Vreeland gloss on FELA, and the hoary tradition behind it, were well established.
