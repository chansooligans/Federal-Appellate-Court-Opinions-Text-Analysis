Vyacheslav Telyatitskiy, a native\n\nand citizen of Ukraine, petitions for review of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his motion to reconsider its\n\nearlier affirmance of an Immigration Judge's (IJ) removal order.\n\nTelyatitskiy argues that the BIA and IJ erred in finding him\n\nineligible     for   withholding        of   removal       under   8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A) and deferral of removal under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).       For the reasons set forth below, the\n\npetition is dismissed.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           Fleeing anti-Semitic violence in Ukraine, Telyatitskiy\n\ncame to the United States as a refugee in 1995 and subsequently\n\nattained lawful permanent resident status.           He placed that status\n\nin   jeopardy,   however,   when   in    2006   he   was    convicted    in   a\n\nMassachusetts court for assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon.   Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the Department\n\nof Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against him\n\nlater that year based on his conviction for an aggravated felony.\n\nTelyatitskiy parried with applications for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and deferral of removal under the CAT.\n\n           After a hearing, an IJ concluded that Telyatitskiy was\n\nremovable.    The IJ also rejected each of Telyatitskiy's claims for\n\nrelief.      First, the IJ determined that the aggravated felony\n\nconviction rendered Telyatitskiy ineligible for asylum under 8\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fU.S.C.     §   1158(b)(2)(B)(i).1    The    IJ     next   found   that,   should\n\nTelyatitskiy be deported to Ukraine, he would likely be persecuted\n\nfor his religion and nationality.           Normally, this finding would\n\nhave qualified him for withholding of removal.                    See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A).       Nevertheless, the IJ found that Telyatitskiy's\n\nconviction constituted a particularly serious crime under the\n\nstandard set forth in Matter of Frentescu, 18 I & N Dec. 244 (BIA\n\n1982), rendering him ineligible for that relief.                  See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii).         Finally, the IJ denied Telyatitskiy's CAT\n\nclaim on the merits, finding that despite Ukraine's status as \"a\n\nseriously      antisemitic   country,\"     there    was   still   insufficient\n\nevidence that any harm to Telyatitskiy \"would be inflicted by or\n\nwith the acquiescence of a public official or other person acting\n\nin an official capacity,\" as required by the treaty's implementing\n\nregulations.\n\n               Telyatitskiy appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, and\n\nthe BIA affirmed.       Although that affirmance constituted a final\n\norder that would have been subject to our circumscribed review,\n\nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), Telyatitskiy did not petition this court\n\nto review it.      Instead, he moved the BIA to reconsider its order,\n\nasking it to revisit some -- but not all -- of the matters that it\n\nhad originally addressed. The BIA denied the motion to reconsider.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Telyatitskiy has not challenged this denial of asylum.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fIt is that denial that Telyatitskiy has petitioned us to review,\n\nand to which we now turn.\n\n                                          II.\n\n              Because Telyatitskiy was deemed removable by reason of\n\nhis conviction of an aggravated felony, our jurisdiction is limited\n\nto a \"review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised\n\nupon a petition for review.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); see Larngar\n\nv. Holder, 562 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n              Telyatitskiy first claims that the IJ's withholding of\n\nremoval analysis was erroneous as a matter of law because it\n\nconsidered improper factors in determining what constitutes a\n\nparticularly serious crime.             In Matter of Frentescu, the BIA held\n\nthat the question of whether a given crime was a particularly\n\nserious   one     turned    on    \"the     nature    of   the    conviction,   the\n\ncircumstances and underlying facts of the conviction, the type of\n\nsentence imposed, and whether the type and circumstances of the\n\ncrime indicate that the alien will be a danger to the community.\"\n\nId. at 247. Some courts have interpreted this standard to preclude\n\nconsideration of information unrelated to the crime of conviction.\n\nSee, e.g., Alaka v. Att'y Gen., 456 F.3d 88, 109 (3d Cir. 2006);\n\nYousefi v. INS, 260 F.3d 318, 329–30 (4th Cir. 2001).\n\n              Here, the IJ appeared to rely not only on the nature of\n\nthe   crime    itself,     but   also    on     Telyatitskiy's    post-conviction\n\nbehavior during his period of incarceration; a previous, unrelated\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fassault charge; and other charges, ultimately dismissed, that were\n\nbrought alongside the charge on which he was convicted. By relying\n\nin part on these additional factors, Telyatitskiy now claims, the\n\nIJ acted beyond the scope of its authority.\n\n          Were this claim properly before us, it might constitute\n\na reviewable question of law.   See Lumataw v. Holder, 582 F.3d 78,\n\n85 (1st Cir. 2009).    But the claim is not properly before us.   To\n\nbegin with, Telyatitskiy has sought judicial review not of the\n\nBIA's underlying withholding decision, but only of the denial of\n\nhis motion for reconsideration. That motion confined itself to his\n\nCAT claim.   Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to consider the\n\nBIA's treatment of the withholding of removal claim.         Liu v.\n\nMukasey, 553 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 2009). Telyatitskiy argues that\n\nwe ought to recognize an exception that would allow us to review\n\nthe BIA's underlying decision.         Yet even if Telyatitskiy had\n\npreserved a withholding claim, a second jurisdictional impediment\n\nwould remain.    Although Telyatitskiy's original administrative\n\nappeal did allege error in the IJ's application of the Frentescu\n\nstandard, that allegation concerned the IJ's failure to consider\n\nall of the evidence.   It was, in other words, an argument that the\n\nIJ looked at too little; it is only now that Telyatitskiy has begun\n\nto argue that the IJ looked at too much.    Where a petitioner fails\n\nto exhaust administrative remedies on a claim by presenting it to\n\nthe BIA, judicial review is precluded.       8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1);\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fKechichian v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008).               Thus, both\n\nbecause of the limited nature of the motion to reconsider and\n\nbecause of his complete failure to argue the scope of relevant\n\nevidence issue to the BIA, Telyatitskiy's withholding of removal\n\nclaim is not reviewable here.\n\n            This leaves Telyatitskiy's claim that the BIA committed\n\nconstitutional or legal error in rejecting his motion to reconsider\n\nthe denial of his CAT claim.           He first argues that by failing to\n\nreference record evidence of police brutality against Jews in\n\nUkraine,    the    IJ   must    have   failed    to   consider     that   evidence\n\nentirely.       A full and fair reading of Telyatitskiy's briefs,\n\nhowever, suggests that this is argument is little more than a\n\nthinly disguised claim concerning evidentiary weight, which we are\n\nstatutorily barred from reviewing.              See Larngar, 562 F.3d at 75;\n\nJimenez v. Gonzales, 215 F. App'x 8, 9 (1st Cir. 2007).                   But even\n\nif reviewable, the argument fails.              An IJ does not err merely by\n\nfailing    to     address   specifically      each    piece   of   evidence    the\n\npetitioner presented.          Pakasi v. Holder, 577 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).                      The\n\nrecord reveals that the IJ considered the totality of the evidence\n\npresented, even if it did not recite that evidence in all its\n\ndetail.2\n\n\n     2\n      Similarly, the BIA is not required to detail exhaustively its\nreasons for affirmance.      Where, as here, the BIA's decision\n\"illuminate[s] the path of its reasoning,\" no more is necessary.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f          Telyatitskiy also contends that even if the IJ considered\n\nthe evidence of police brutality, he must have done so under a\n\nlegally erroneous definition of torture.    To be actionable under\n\nthe CAT, torture must be both likely to occur after removal and\n\n\"inflicted by or at the instigation of or within the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an\n\nofficial capacity.\"   8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).   While acknowledging\n\npopular anti-Semitism in Ukraine, the IJ found that Telyatitskiy\n\nhad not presented sufficient evidence to establish that the state\n\naction requirement would likely be satisfied.    Telyatitskiy posits\n\nthat this finding is fundamentally incompatible with the record,\n\nwhich included studies documenting human rights abuses in Ukrainian\n\npretrial detention facilities as well as his own account of abuse\n\nat the hands of the Ukrainian police during his youth.   Again, this\n\nappears to be little more than a weight-of-the-evidence argument.\n\nTelyatitskiy points to no error of law, but merely expresses\n\nincredulity that the IJ could have rejected a proffer as strong as\n\nhe believed his to be.     Judicial review of such claims is not\n\npermitted under § 1252.\n\n                               III.\n\n          The petition for review is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\nLopez Perez v. Holder, 587 F.3d 456, 460 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

Normally, this finding would have qualified him for withholding of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). Nevertheless, the IJ <span class=\"star-pagination\">*630</span> found that Telyatitskiy's conviction constituted a particularly serious crime under the standard set forth in <i>Matter of Frentescu,</i> 18 I &amp; N Dec. 244 (BIA 1982), rendering him ineligible for that relief. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). Finally, the IJ denied Telyatitskiy's CAT claim on the merits, finding that despite Ukraine's status as \"a seriously antisemitic country,\" there was still insufficient evidence that any harm to Telyatitskiy \"would be inflicted by or with the acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,\" as required by the treaty's implementing regulations.</p>\n<p>Telyatitskiy appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, and the BIA affirmed. Although that affirmance constituted a final order that would have been subject to our circumscribed review, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), Telyatitskiy did not petition this court to review it. Instead, he moved the BIA to reconsider its order, asking it to revisit somebut not allof the matters that it had originally addressed. The BIA denied the motion to reconsider. It is that denial that Telyatitskiy has petitioned us to review, and to which we now turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Because Telyatitskiy was deemed removable by reason of his conviction of an aggravated felony, our jurisdiction is limited to a \"review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); <i>see </i><i>Larngar v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203763\"><a href=\"/opinion/203763/larngar-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Telyatitskiy first claims that the IJ's withholding of removal analysis was erroneous as a matter of law because it considered improper factors in determining what constitutes a particularly serious crime. In <i>Matter of Frentescu,</i> the BIA held that the question of whether a given crime was a particularly serious one turned on \"the nature of the conviction, the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and whether the type and circumstances of the crime indicate that the alien will be a danger to the community.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247. Some courts have interpreted this standard to preclude consideration of information unrelated to the crime of conviction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Alaka v. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795163\"><a href=\"/opinion/795163/oyenike-alaka-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 109 (3d Cir.2006); <i>Yousefi v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774402\"><a href=\"/opinion/774402/mohammad-musa-yousefi-aka-mohammad-m-yousefi-aka-mohammad-yousafi/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span>, 329-30 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Here, the IJ appeared to rely not only on the nature of the crime itself, but also on Telyatitskiy's post-conviction behavior during his period of incarceration; a previous, unrelated assault charge; and other charges, ultimately dismissed, that were brought alongside the charge on which he was convicted. By relying in part on these additional factors, Telyatitskiy now claims, the IJ acted beyond the scope of its authority.</p>\n<p>Were this claim properly before us, it might constitute a reviewable question of law. <i>See </i><i>Lumataw v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2009). But the claim is not properly before us. To begin with, Telyatitskiy has sought judicial review not of the BIA's underlying withholding decision, but only of the denial of his motion for reconsideration. That motion confined itself to his CAT claim. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to consider the BIA's treatment of the withholding of removal claim. <i>Liu v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203625\"><a href=\"/opinion/203625/liu-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir. 2009). Telyatitskiy argues that we ought to recognize an exception that would allow us to review the BIA's underlying decision. Yet even if Telyatitskiy had preserved a withholding claim, a second jurisdictional impediment would remain. Although Telyatitskiy's original administrative appeal did allege error in the IJ's application of the <i>Frentescu</i> standard, that allegation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*631</span> concerned the IJ's failure to consider all of the evidence. It was, in other words, an argument that the IJ looked at too little; it is only now that Telyatitskiy has begun to argue that the IJ looked at too much. Where a petitioner fails to exhaust administrative remedies on a claim by presenting it to the BIA, judicial review is precluded. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); <i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203402\"><a href=\"/opinion/203402/kechichian-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2008). Thus, both because of the limited nature of the motion to reconsider and because of his complete failure to argue the scope of relevant evidence issue to the BIA, Telyatitskiy's withholding of removal claim is not reviewable here.</p>\n<p>This leaves Telyatitskiy's claim that the BIA committed constitutional or legal error in rejecting his motion to reconsider the denial of his CAT claim. He first argues that by failing to reference record evidence of police brutality against Jews in Ukraine, the IJ must have failed to consider that evidence entirely. A full and fair reading of Telyatitskiy's briefs, however, suggests that this is argument is little more than a thinly disguised claim concerning evidentiary weight, which we are statutorily barred from reviewing. <i>See </i><i>Larngar,</i> 562 F.3d at 75; <i>Jimenez v. Gonzales,</i> 215 Fed.Appx. 8, 9 (1st Cir. 2007). But even if reviewable, the argument fails. An IJ does not err merely by failing to address specifically each piece of evidence the petitioner presented. <i>Pakasi v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203955\"><a href=\"/opinion/203955/pakasi-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2000). The record reveals that the IJ considered the totality of the evidence presented, even if it did not recite that evidence in all its detail.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Telyatitskiy also contends that even if the IJ considered the evidence of police brutality, he must have done so under a legally erroneous definition of torture. To be actionable under the CAT, torture must be both likely to occur after removal and \"inflicted by or at the instigation of or within the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1). While acknowledging popular anti-Semitism in Ukraine, the IJ found that Telyatitskiy had not presented sufficient evidence to establish that the state action requirement would likely be satisfied. Telyatitskiy posits that this finding is fundamentally incompatible with the record, which included studies documenting human rights abuses in Ukrainian pretrial detention facilities as well as his own account of abuse at the hands of the Ukrainian police during his youth. Again, this appears to be little more than a weight-of-the-evidence argument. Telyatitskiy points to no error of law, but merely expresses incredulity that the IJ could have rejected a proffer as strong as he believed his to be. Judicial review of such claims is not permitted under § 1252.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>dismissed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Telyatitskiy has not challenged this denial of asylum.</p>\n<p>[2]  Similarly, the BIA is not required to detail exhaustively its reasons for affirmance. Where, as here, the BIA's decision \"illuminate[s] the path of its reasoning,\" no more is necessary. <i>Lopez Perez v.
