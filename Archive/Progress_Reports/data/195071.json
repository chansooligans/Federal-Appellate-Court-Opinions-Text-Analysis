In  this  appeal, defendant  Stephen\n                      \n\nThomas  Connolly challenges his convictions on four counts of\n\na  five count  indictment  charging  him  with  making  false\n\nstatements to the United States,  in violation of 18 U.S.C.  \n\n1001.1   Finding each  of defendant's appellate  arguments to\n\nbe entirely unpersuasive, we affirm.\n\n          This  case arises  out  of  defendant's failure  to\n\ndisclose  earned  income  while applying  for  and  receiving\n\nworker's compensation benefits.  Defendant,  a postal service\n\nletter  carrier,  suffered  a  work-related  back  injury  on\n\nFebruary  20, 1990.   Soon  thereafter, he  made a  claim for\n\npartial disability  and in support  of it, filed a  series of\n\nDepartment  of Labor  CA-8 forms.2   On  the four  CA-8 forms\n\nwhich underpin the counts of conviction, defendant left blank\n\nsections 9a  and  9b,  which directed  him  to  disclose  any\n\nsalaried  employment  and/or commission  and  self-employment\n\n(regardless  of  whether  any  income  actually   was  earned\n\ntherefrom) in which  he was engaged during the  period he was\n\nseeking  disability  compensation.   At  trial, however,  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  In  that portion of  the statute  relevant to  this case,\nsection 1001 provides:   \"Whoever, in  any matter within  the\njurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States\nknowingly and willfully . .  . makes any false, fictitious or\nfraudulent statements or representations . . . shall be fined\nnot more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years,\nor both.\"\n\n2.  The  CA-8  forms   all  carry  the  caption   \"Claim  for\nContinuing Compensation on Account of Disability.\"\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ngovernment demonstrated that, from August 1990 through August\n\n1991, defendant was employed as a delivery man for Aku-Aku, a\n\nBoston   restaurant.3    Defendant   does  not  contest  this\n\nemployment and that he  should have noted it in  section 9 of\n\nthe four relevant CA-8 forms.\n\n          In his poorly organized  appellate brief, defendant\n\nmakes  three arguments which  warrant brief discussion:   (1)\n\nthat the  evidence presented was insufficient for the jury to\n\nhave found that he acted \"knowingly  and willfully\"; (2) that\n\nthe omitted  information  was not  \"material\"  and  therefore\n\ncould not give rise to criminal liability under section 1001;\n\nand   (3)   that  the   jury's   verdict  was   impermissibly\n\ninconsistent.4  We address each claim in turn.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Although the government asserts that defendant maintained\nhis  employment with Aku-Aku through October 1991, nothing in\nthe  record indicates  that  defendant's employment  with the\nrestaurant  continued past  August  1991.   Regardless,  this\ndiscrepancy has no impact upon our analysis.\n\n4.  Defendant  alludes  to  the question  of  whether leaving\nsection  9 blank can constitute a statement or representation\nunder section 1001.   Given the fact that  defendant presents\nus  with no argument and cites to no authority on this point,\nand  given the  further fact  that  there is  authority which\nsupports  the proposition  that  leaving  a  form  blank  can\nconstitute a statement or representation  under section 1001,\nsee  United States  v. Mattox,  689 F.2d  531, 533  (5th Cir.\n                             \n1982); United States  v. Irwin, 654 F.2d 671,  676 (10th Cir.\n                              \n1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1016 (1982), we will regard the\n                   \nargument as  waived.   See United  States v.  Innamorati, 996\n                                                        \nF.2d 456, 468 (1st Cir.) (issues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner  deemed waived on  appeal), cert. denied,  62 U.S.L.W.\n                                               \n3320 (Nov. 1, 1993).  \n     Defendant   further   challenges   the   indictment   as\n\"multiplicitous.\"  He has, however, also waived this argument\nby failing to raise it prior to trial.  See Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n                                           \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          1.  As  is always the case when  confronted with an\n\nargument  that there was  insufficient evidence to  support a\n\nconviction, we review the evidence \"in a light most favorable\n\nto the government and resolv[e] all credibility issues in its\n\nfavor.\"  E.g., United States v.  Fisher, 3 F.2d 456, 462 n.18\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).   Here, there was ample  evidence upon which\n\nthe jury could have rested its conclusion  that defendant, in\n\nfailing to complete  sections 9a and 9b of  the relevant CA-8\n\nforms, acted \"knowingly  and willfully.\"  Defendant  admitted\n\nat trial that he probably read sections 9a and 9b of the CA-8\n\nforms, and that he didn't  find the wording of these sections\n\nambiguous or confusing.  Moreover, there was evidence, in the\n\nform of both  a sworn statement given by  defendant to postal\n\ninspectors   investigating  his  case  and  in  the  form  of\n\ntestimony by one  of these postal inspectors,  that defendant\n\nunderstood that he was obliged to report  income from outside\n\nemployment  on the  CA-8  forms.5   In light  of this,  it is\n\napparent that defendant's sufficiency argument must fail.\n\n          2.  Defendant's  second argument, that  the omitted\n\ninformation  was not  \"material,\" does  not  require extended\n\ndiscussion.   While  it is true  that \"`[m]ateriality  of the\n\n                    \n\n12(b)(2) and Fed. R. Crim.  P. 12(f) (defenses and objections\nbased upon defects in the  indictment must be raised prior to\ntrial); see  also United States  v. Rodriguez, 858  F.2d 809,\n                                             \n816-17 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n5.  On  appeal, defendant does  not argue that  this evidence\nwas improperly admitted.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nalleged  misstatements is  an essential  element of  offenses\n\ndefined by 18 U.S.C.    1001,'\" United States v. Corsino, 812\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  26,  30  (1st  Cir.  1987)  (quoting  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nRadetsky, 535  F.2d 556, 571  (10th Cir.), cert.  denied, 429\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 820 (1976)),  we have defined \"material\"  information as\n\nmerely  that which has \"`a  natural tendency to influence, or\n\n[is]  capable of  affecting  or  influencing, a  governmental\n\nfunction,'\" Corsino, 812 F.2d at 30 (quoting United States v.\n                                                          \n\nMarkham, 537 F.2d 187, 196 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 1041 (1977)).  Thus,  statements can be material even if\n\nthey were  ignored, never relied  upon, or never read  by the\n\nagency.  See Corsino, 812 F.2d at 31.\n                    \n\n          Here,  there  was  uncontroverted  trial  testimony\n\nthat, if defendant had disclosed his income from Aku-Aku, the\n\nDepartment  of Labor  might  have  readjusted his  disability\n\ncompensation.   Furthermore,  there was  uncontroverted trial\n\ntestimony  that, if defendant had disclosed his delivery job,\n\nthe  Department of Labor  might have reevaluated  his medical\n\nstatus.   Given this testimony, there  is no basis for  us to\n\nupset  the  district  court's  finding, see  id.  at  31  n.3\n                                                \n\n(materiality  under    section  1001  is a  question  for the\n\ncourt,  and  not  the  jury, to  decide),  that  the  omitted\n\ninformation was material.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  At oral argument, counsel for defendant indicated that he\nwas precluded  from cross-examining  the relevant  government\nwitnesses on  the issue  of materiality.   Our review  of the\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          3.   Defendant's third and final argument, that the\n\njury's  verdict  was  impermissibly  inconsistent,  also   is\n\nunavailing.  Even  if we were  to credit defendant's  dubious\n\nassertion that the verdict here necessarily was inconsistent,\n\nit is well settled that, in criminal cases, \"[c]onsistency in\n\nthe verdict  is not necessary.\"   Dunn v. United  States, 284\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 390, 393  (1932); see also United States  v.

Accordingly, we  summarily\n\nreject defendant's request  for a new trial insofar  as it is\n\nbased upon his claim that the verdict here was inconsistent.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\nrecord, however,  reveals that  defense counsel  was not,  in\nfact, prevented from so inquiring.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n",

Defendant, a postal service letter carrier, suffered a work-related back injury on February 20, 1990.  Soon thereafter, he made a claim for partial disability and in support of it, filed a series of Department of Labor CA-8 forms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On the four CA-8 forms which underpin the counts of conviction, defendant left blank sections 9a and 9b, which directed him to disclose any salaried employment and/or commission and self-employment (regardless of whether any income actually was earned therefrom) in which he was engaged during the period he was seeking disability compensation.  At trial, however, the government demonstrated that, from August 1990 through August 1991, defendant was employed as a delivery man for Aku-Aku, a Boston restaurant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Defendant does not contest this employment and that he should have noted it in section 9 of the four relevant CA-8 forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his poorly organized appellate brief, defendant makes three arguments which warrant brief discussion:  (1) that the evidence presented was insufficient for the jury to have found that he acted \"knowingly and willfully\";  (2) that the omitted information was not \"material\" and therefore could not give rise to criminal liability under section 1001;  and (3) that the jury's verdict was impermissibly inconsistent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We address each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. As is always the case when confronted with an argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction, we review the evidence \"in a light most favorable to the government and resolv[e] all credibility issues in its favor.\"  E.g., United States v. Fisher, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span>, 462 n.18 (1st Cir. 1993).  Here, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could have rested its conclusion that defendant, in failing to complete sections 9a and 9b of the relevant CA-8 forms, acted \"knowingly and willfully.\"  Defendant admitted at trial that he probably read sections 9a and 9b of the CA-8 forms, and that he didn't find the wording of these sections ambiguous or confusing.  Moreover, there was evidence, in the form of both a sworn statement given by defendant to postal inspectors investigating his case and in the form of testimony by one of these postal inspectors, that defendant understood that he was obliged to report income from outside employment on the CA-8 forms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In light of this, it is apparent that defendant's sufficiency argument must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Defendant's second argument, that the omitted information was not \"material,\" does not require extended discussion.  While it is true that \" '[m]ateriality of the alleged misstatements is an essential element of offenses defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001,' \"  United States v. Corsino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483542\"><a href=\"/opinion/483542/united-states-v-rafael-corsino/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting  United States v. Radetsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335359\"><a href=\"/opinion/335359/united-states-v-louis-martin-radetsky-aka-l-m-radetsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span>, 571 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></span> (1976)), we have defined \"material\" information as merely that which has \" 'a natural tendency to influence, or [is] capable of affecting or influencing, a governmental function,' \"  Corsino, 812 F.2d at 30 (quoting  United States v. Markham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336344\"><a href=\"/opinion/336344/united-states-v-e-l-markham-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 196 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></span> (1977)).  Thus, statements can be material even if they were ignored, never relied upon, or never read by the agency.   See Corsino, 812 F.2d at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was uncontroverted trial testimony that, if defendant had disclosed his income from Aku-Aku, the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Department of Labor might have readjusted his disability compensation.  Furthermore, there was uncontroverted trial testimony that, if defendant had disclosed his delivery job, the Department of Labor might have reevaluated his medical status.  Given this testimony, there is no basis for us to upset the district court's finding, see id. at 31 n.3 (materiality under &#167; section 1001 is a question for the court, and not the jury, to decide), that the omitted information was material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Defendant's third and final argument, that the jury's verdict was impermissibly inconsistent, also is unavailing.  Even if we were to credit defendant's dubious assertion that the verdict here necessarily was inconsistent, it is well settled that, in criminal cases, \"[c]onsistency in the verdict is not necessary.\"   Dunn v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101833\"><a href=\"/opinion/101833/dunn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 393 (1932);   see also United States v.
