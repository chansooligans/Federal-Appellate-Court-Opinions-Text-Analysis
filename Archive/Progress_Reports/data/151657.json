Appellants John and Richard Puccio\n\nappeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs, Andrew and Kelly Zimmerman, on behalf of a class of\n\nclients of Cambridge Credit Counseling Corporation (\"Cambridge\"),\n\none of the Puccios' business enterprises, pursuant to the Credit\n\nRepair Organizations Act (\"CROA\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679-1679j.          CROA\n\nwas enacted by Congress in 1996 to protect the public from unfair\n\nor deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair\n\norganizations.\n\n          Although the district court entered summary judgment\n\nagainst   the    Puccios   and   multiple   corporate   defendants    for\n\nviolations of CROA, the corporate defendants have not appealed.\n\nInstead, the Puccios appeal the judgment against them personally\n\nfor the violation of two provisions of CROA, the first making it\n\nunlawful to \"make or use any untrue or misleading representation of\n\nthe services of the credit repair organization,\" id. § 1679b(a)(3),\n\nand the second making it unlawful to \"engage . . . [in a] course of\n\nbusiness that constitutes or results in the commission of, or an\n\nattempt to commit, a fraud or deception on any person in connection\n\nwith the offer or sale of the services of the credit repair\n\norganization,\" id. § 1679b(a)(4).\n\n          The Puccios argue that they do not fall within the ambit\n\nof CROA because Cambridge, their credit counseling enterprise, does\n\nnot qualify as a \"credit repair organization\" as defined by the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fAct.    They also argue that the district court erred in piercing the\n\ncorporate veil when it found them liable for violating Section\n\n1679b(a)(4).      Finally, in their primary argument directed at their\n\nsubstantive liability under Section 1679b(a)(3), the Puccios argue\n\nthat the district court did not, in fact, find them liable under\n\nthe    \"misleading     representation\"           provision,    id.    §    1679b(a)(3).\n\nAlternatively, if the district court did find them liable under\n\n(a)(3), the Puccios argue (but only barely) that the district court\n\nagain erred in piercing the corporate veil.\n\n            After      careful    consideration,        we    affirm       the   district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.                       We conclude\n\nthat Cambridge was a \"credit repair organization\" within the\n\nmeaning    of   CROA.       We    also    conclude     that   the     district      court\n\nunambiguously        held        the      Puccios      liable        for     misleading\n\nrepresentations under Section 1679b(a)(3) of CROA, and we affirm\n\nthat    finding   of    liability        based    on   the   court's       piercing   the\n\ncorporate veil analysis.               We do not reach the Puccios' liability\n\nunder Section 1679b(a)(4), and their attendant arguments about the\n\nsummary judgment standard and corporate veil-piercing, because the\n\nPuccios' liability under Section 1679b(a)(3) fully supports the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n                                            I.\n\n            In this appeal from the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the plaintiffs, we must recite the material facts in\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, in\n\nthis case, the defendants. Torres Vargas v. Santiago Cummings, 149\n\nF.3d 29, 30 (1st Cir. 1998).       Nonetheless, that requirement has\n\nless significance here because we draw much of our recitation of\n\nthe facts from the plaintiffs' statement of material facts, which\n\nforms part of the undisputed record on appeal.           It is undisputed\n\nbecause the district court deemed the plaintiffs' statement of\n\nfacts   admitted   in   the   absence    of   proper   opposition    by    the\n\ndefendants pursuant to the District of Massachusetts Local Rule\n\n56.1.   Zimmerman v. Puccio, 529 F. Supp. 2d 254, 258 n.3 (D. Mass.\n\n2008) (\"It must be noted that Defendants failed properly to dispute\n\nmany of Plaintiffs' proffered facts. . . . In such instances, the\n\ncourt has taken the Plaintiffs' account as true.\").                 The rule\n\nrequires that a party's opposition to a motion for summary judgment\n\ninclude a \"concise statement of the material facts of record as to\n\nwhich it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be\n\ntried, with page references to affidavits, depositions and other\n\ndocumentation.\"    D. Mass. Local R. 56.1.       In the absence of such a\n\nstatement, \"[m]aterial facts of record set forth in the statement\n\nrequired to be served by the moving party will be deemed for\n\npurposes of the motion to be admitted by opposing parties.\"               Id.\n\n           We have reiterated the importance of such rules to the\n\ndistrict courts in preventing litigants from shifting the burden of\n\norganizing evidence to the district court, and \"we treat the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdistrict   court's   decision   to    apply   [them]   with   deference.\"\n\nCarreras v. Sajo, Garcia & Partners, 596 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).     In this case, the defendants' failure to provide any\n\ncitations whatsoever in their opposition statement leaves no doubt\n\nas to their noncompliance.      That the parties filed cross motions\n\nfor summary judgment does not affect either party's obligation to\n\ncomply with the local rule.          See P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Rivera-\n\nVázquez, 603 F.3d 125, 132 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"A party cannot\n\ncircumvent the requirements imposed by an anti-ferret rule simply\n\nby filing a cross-motion for summary judgment and expecting the\n\ndistrict court to do its homework.\").          The defendants offer no\n\nother reason why we should revisit the district court's decision to\n\ndeem the facts in the plaintiffs' statement to be admitted and we\n\ndecline to do so.1\n\nA. The Puccio Companies\n\n           1. Corporate Structure\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Due to the defendants' failure to respond to the plaintiffs'\nrequests for admissions for almost two years, a period well beyond\nthat required by rule, the district court also deemed them to have\nadmitted the facts in the plaintiffs' requests for admissions.\nZimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 271.       Because we find that the\ndistrict court was well within its discretion to deem the\nplaintiffs' statement of facts admitted, and that the facts therein\nprovide an ample basis for affirming the judgment, we need not rely\non - or reach the legal issues surrounding - the deemed requests\nfor admissions. To the extent that any fact put forward in the\ndeemed statement of facts relies for record support on the requests\nfor admissions, we do not treat that fact as admitted.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f             In    the   early   1990s,    John   Puccio    controlled      several\n\nentities doing business in the arena of debt management.2                        He\n\nstarted Cambridge Credit Corp. (\"CCC\"), a New York corporation, in\n\n1993.     Later that year, he founded Brighton Credit Corp. (\"BCC\"),\n\nalso in New York.             He served as president of both for-profit\n\ncorporations.        The companies shared office space and employed\n\nalmost identical client contracts.\n\n             After CCC and BCC were ordered to cease operating by the\n\nNew York Banking Department in 1996,3 John Puccio decided to move\n\nhis     operations       to    Massachusetts      and     start    a   non-profit\n\norganization.        He and his brother Richard co-founded Cambridge,\n\nwhich adopted the Service Agreements used previously by for-profits\n\nBCC and CCC.       It provided the same debt management service as did\n\nthose companies and employed their staff.                 As he had for BCC and\n\nCCC, John Puccio served as president of the company.                        Richard\n\nPuccio was Cambridge's Vice President and strategic planner.                     He\n\nwas also a board member of the company.               In 1996, John Puccio filed\n\npapers     to     register     Cambridge   as     a    nonprofit   entity     under\n\nMassachusetts law and as a 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) non-profit entity\n\nunder federal law.\n\n\n      2\n       For reference, we have created an Appendix listing the\nentities, their acronyms, location and status.\n      3\n       The order concluded that the two companies were acting in\nviolation of prohibitions in New York law on for-profit entities\nconducting \"budget planning\" business and on conducting a \"money\ntransmission business without an appropriate license.\"\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          Shortly after the formation of Cambridge, John Puccio\n\narranged to have the new company purchase the \"intangible assets\"\n\nof BCC and CCC for $14.1 million.         Although the Intangible Asset\n\nSale Agreement purported to convey to Cambridge the goodwill in the\n\ntrademarks and copyrights of BCC and CCC, neither company had been\n\nissued any trademarks or copyrights at the time of the purchase.\n\nMoreover, the sale was concluded without negotiation and in the\n\nabsence of independent representation for Cambridge.\n\n              Around   the   same   time,   John   Puccio   also   founded\n\nCambridge/Brighton Budget Planning Corporation (\"CBBPC\") in New\n\nYork as a \"credit counseling\" agency and another \"credit counseling\n\nagency,\" Brighton Credit Management Corp. (\"BCMC\"), a Florida\n\nentity.   Both were controlled by John Puccio, who handled day-to-\n\nday operations and hiring and oversaw the general operations of the\n\nbusinesses.    They used service agreements virtually identical to\n\nthe Puccios' other concerns and advertised their affiliation with\n\neach other and with Cambridge.\n\n          All three companies, Cambridge, CBBPC, and BCMC, got\n\n\"back office support\" for their operations from yet another Puccio\n\nentity, Brighton Credit Corp. of Massachusetts (\"BC Mass\").4            BC\n\n\n     4\n        BC Mass changed its name to Brighton Debt Management\nServices, Inc. in 2003. Still later, it changed its name to First\nConsumers. BC Mass was jointly owned by John and Richard Puccio.\nAfter the first name change, John Puccio became listed as the sole\nshareholder and president of the company. Defendants conceded that\n\"the businesses were essentially the same from Brighton Credit of\nMass to Brighton DMS to First Consumers.\" For the purposes of this\n\n                                    -8-\n\fMass worked exclusively for the three Puccio companies. It did not\n\nhave clients of its own, but performed all mailing, correspondence,\n\nongoing   customer   services,   and   record-keeping   services   in\n\nconnection with the debt management service being sold by the other\n\nPuccio companies. It also handled Cambridge's \"Good Payer\" program\n\nand took care of all other matters related to client accounting,\n\nincluding the central function of communicating with creditors in\n\norder to achieve the re-aging5 of client accounts.      If a client\n\ncalled the phone number provided by Cambridge, a BC Mass employee\n\nwould answer.\n\n          John and Richard Puccio created and controlled several\n\nadditional companies. For example, Debt Relief Clearinghouse Ltd.,\n\nwas the marketing arm of the Puccio organization, while Cypress\n\nAdvertising and Promotions, Inc., placed advertisements for the\n\nPuccio credit companies.   All of the businesses shared employees\n\nand office space, and the managers of one company supervised\n\nemployees of the others.\n\n          The Puccios treated their companies interchangeably.\n\nThey charged expenses for one company to the credit card of\n\nanother, while paying the bill with a check from yet another of the\n\ncorporations.   At least one person who worked for CCC, Cambridge\n\n\nopinion, we refer to all iterations of that entity as BC Mass.\n     5\n       As we discuss in greater detail later in this opinion, re-\naging accounts involves negotiating with creditors to re-label past\ndue accounts as current.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fand   BC   Mass   at   different       times    directly   received     the    bank\n\nstatements and paid the bills of one Puccio company while he was\n\nnot an employee of that company, but instead worked for a different\n\nPuccio enterprise.        While John Puccio was running Cambridge, the\n\ncompany    paid   large   sums    of    money    to   other   Puccio-controlled\n\ncompanies without consideration.               For example, JRJ Associates,\n\nInc., a company owned by John and Richard Puccio, was paid at least\n\n$150,000 by Cambridge.           John and Richard Puccio also purchased\n\npersonal items with corporate funds.                  Personal charges from a\n\n\"gentleman's      club\"   and    for    a   yacht     appeared   on   the    Puccio\n\ncompanies' corporate credit card bills.\n\n            The    Puccios      paid    themselves      salaries      from    their\n\ncorporations.      In 2001 and 2003, they were each paid $624,000 by\n\nCambridge.     John Puccio was paid $648,000 in 2004.                  His total\n\nsalary from his credit companies for the period from 1996 to 2004\n\nwas $30,987,572, while Richard Puccio's aggregate compensation was\n\n$21,719,908.\n\n            2. Corporate Services\n\n            Cambridge, CBBPC and BCMC created individualized Debt\n\nManagement Plans (\"Debt Plans\") for clients.                     Customers were\n\ncharged an up front \"Design Fee\" for the development of the Debt\n\nPlan equal to the amount of one monthly payment as well as a ten\n\npercent monthly fee or twenty-five dollars, whichever was greater.\n\nThe plans would set a single monthly payment to be paid by the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fclient to the particular Puccio enterprise servicing that client,\n\nwhich would then be dispersed to the client's creditors.                The\n\nPuccio companies would also negotiate with a client's creditors for\n\nbetter terms on their debt through interest rate reductions or\n\ndecreases in principal.        They would also attempt to \"re-age\"\n\nclients' accounts by convincing creditors who were owed late\n\npayments to re-label the accounts as current.          In exchange for re-\n\naging, the Puccio company would commit its customers to making\n\npayments on the account for a set amount of time.\n\n              The IRS form accompanying Cambridge's application for\n\n501(c)(3) status, which was signed by John Puccio, stated that the\n\ncompany's clients would enjoy \"Improved Credit Rating.\" On its tax\n\nreturns in 2000, 2001 and 2003, Cambridge described the principal\n\nobjective of its Debt Management Program as including \"improv[ing]\n\na consumer's credit rating over time by establishing a consistent\n\npayment history.\"\n\n              Cambridge, BCMC and CBBPC advertised their ability to\n\nimprove   a    client's   credit.   The    three   companies'   promotional\n\nmaterials made promises such as \"we can help you . . . restore your\n\ncredit rating,\" and \"[w]hen you join our debt management program,\n\nwe'll be able to help you reestablish your credit.\"             The company\n\nsent out a quarterly newsletter containing advice on how \"to\n\nrebuild your credit.\"      Cambridge's website stated that \"by taking\n\nadvantage of our Debt Management Program, we can help you . . . Re-\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\festablish Your Credit.\"      The website also had a feature called\n\n\"Cambridge   Answer   Man\"   to   \"help   people   understand   the   often\n\nconfusing world of credit.\" A customer who used this feature would\n\nbe able to click for answers to questions such as \"How Can I\n\nRebuild My Credit?\" The welcome package sent to clients after they\n\nenrolled with Cambridge contained a section entitled \"A Fresh\n\nStart.\"   The materials asserted, \"that is exactly what you have\n\nreceived by joining our program\" and listed \"an improved credit\n\nprofile\" among the \"life benefits\" received by clients using\n\nCambridge's program.\n\n          The contract sent to clients contained disclaimers that\n\nstated:\n\n                 The CLIENT understands that CAMBRIDGE\n          makes no representation about any aspect of\n          the CLIENT'S credit rating.     Creditors will\n          sometimes report participation in CAMBRIDGE's\n          program as a \"consumer credit counseling\" item\n          on your credit report. Persons with perfect\n          credit histories may have their credit record\n          adversely affected. CAMBRIDGE has no control\n          over reporting or interpretation, as it is\n          strictly a creditor and lender decision. The\n          CLIENT's credit rating is outside the scope of\n          this Agreement, however, at the CLIENT's\n          request, CAMBRIDGE will provide CLIENT with\n          credit references based upon CLIENT's payment\n          history with CAMBRIDGE.\n          . . .\n                 CAMBRIDGE has not authorized any person\n          or other company to make representations on\n          its behalf concerning fees, credit, any\n          services to be performed by CAMBRIDGE or any\n          other matter. In the event you were referred\n          to   CAMBRIDGE   by   another    company,  you\n          understand that the other company was not\n          authorized to make any representations about\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          CAMBRIDGE or its services. You agree that all\n          the representations concerning fees, credit,\n          refinancing or any services to be performed by\n          CAMBRIDGE that were made by CAMBRIDGE or\n          relied upon by you when you signed this\n          Service Agreement are set forth in this\n          Agreement. . . .      All the obligations of\n          CAMBRIDGE are set forth in this agreement.\n\n          Employees of BC Mass, who responded to phone calls from\n\nCambridge, BCMC and CBBPC's clients, were trained to speak about\n\nthe benefits of re-aging accounts.   All employees were coached to\n\nanswer questions about how joining a Debt Plan might affect a\n\nclient's credit score.    The sales scripts used by the Puccio\n\ncompanies directed their employees to tell clients,\n\n          You're already behind with the bills so this\n          can only help your credit.

Their\n\ncompensation, at least for a time, was linked to how many customers\n\nthey enrolled because they were paid a commission from the initial\n\nfees paid by clients.         At Cambridge, employees could earn bonuses\n\nfor high sales, while low sales volumes were penalized.\n\nB. The Zimmermans6\n\n               Andrew and Kelly Zimmerman are a married couple. In late\n\n2001, they learned about Cambridge through radio, television, and\n\ninternet advertisements.            Attracted to the company's non-profit\n\nstatus and hopeful that it could help the couple deal with their\n\ndebt, Andrew Zimmerman called Cambridge's toll-free number. He was\n\neventually faxed a five-page Service Agreement, which he signed.\n\nThe    agreement       provided    that   Cambridge   would      consolidate   the\n\nZimmerman's monthly payments into a single payment, use its best\n\nefforts to reduce the amount of the monthly payment and the\n\n\n\n       6\n      Although the plaintiffs' filings indicate that their surname\nis spelled \"Zimmermann,\" we, like the district court, continue to\nuse the incorrect spelling for consistency among the multiple\nopinions arising from this action.\n\n                                          -14-\n\finterest rates being paid to creditors, and pay the Zimmermans a\n\nportion of creditor contributions obtained through Cambridge's\n\n\"Good Payer Program.\"7\n\n            When the Zimmermans returned the contract to Cambridge,\n\nthe company offered them a proposed Debt Plan with a monthly\n\npayment of $798.00.   The Zimmermans enrolled in the Debt Plan.   In\n\nreturn for its services, as described above, Cambridge charged a\n\n\"Design Fee\" in the amount of one monthly payment and a monthly\n\npayment processing fee of ten percent or twenty-five dollars,\n\nwhichever was greater.\n\n            Without their knowledge, once the Zimmermans enrolled in\n\nthe Debt Plan and paid the $798.00 Design Fee, their account was\n\ntransferred from Cambridge to BC Mass, a for-profit company.      BC\n\nMass mailed the Zimmermans a welcome packet and proceeded to\n\nadminister their account by negotiating a reduction in the interest\n\nrate on some of their debts, eliminating some of their late charges\n\nand fees, and decreasing the minimum payments on some of their\n\naccounts.   The Zimmermans were never told that their account would\n\nbe handled by a for-profit back office company, or that this\n\ncompany would be contacting their creditors and would have access\n\n\n     7\n       Under the Good Payer Program, Cambridge solicited payments\nfrom its clients' creditors in exchange for Cambridge's services.\nFor every six month period during which a client made all payments\n\"on time and in the required amount,\" Cambridge would pay them a\n\"bonus\" of fifty percent of any contributions obtained from the\nclient's creditors.    The record does not disclose any further\ndetails about this program.\n\n                                -15-\n\fto personal information about them.   To the contrary, the contract\n\nthe Zimmermans signed with Cambridge explicitly identified the\n\ncompany as a \"not-for-profit organization.\"\n\n          Approximately nine months after signing their contract\n\nwith Cambridge, the Zimmermans terminated the relationship in\n\nSeptember 2002.   They filed for bankruptcy in late 2003.\n\n                                II.\n\n          This class action law suit originated in 2003, when the\n\nZimmermans filed a complaint against John and Richard Puccio (the\n\ndefendants), Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., Cambridge/Brighton\n\nBudget Planning Corp., Brighton Credit Management Corp., Cambridge\n\nCredit Corp., Brighton Credit Corp., Brighton Debt Management\n\nServices, Ltd., Brighton Credit Corp. of Massachusetts, and several\n\nadditional corporate defendants (the corporate defendants).8      The\n\nZimmermans'   amended   complaint   charged   the   defendants   with\n\nviolations of CROA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679-1679j, and with unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices in violation of the Massachusetts\n\nConsumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\n\n          The district court initially granted the defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss the Zimmermans' federal claims, finding that, as\n\na non-profit entity, Cambridge was exempt from CROA.    On appeal of\n\nthat judgment, we vacated the district court's dismissal of the\n\n\n     8\n       The additional defendants were Debt Relief Clearinghouse,\nLtd., Cypress Advertising and Promotions, Southfork Asset\nManagement Corp., and First Consumers Credit Management Corp.\n\n                               -16-\n\fplaintiffs'     federal     claims.     Zimmerman      v.    Cambridge        Credit\n\nCounseling Corp., 409 F.3d 473, 479 (1st Cir. 2005).                 We concluded\n\nthat the statutory exception to CROA liability for \"any nonprofit\n\norganization which is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)\"\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code, 15 U.S.C. § 1679(a)(3)(B)(i), did not\n\napply to the defendants simply because they had registered as\n\nsection   501(c)(3)     entities.      Zimmerman,      409    F.3d       at   475-77.\n\nInstead, we held that in order to qualify for the statutory\n\nexemption,    an   entity    \"must    actually   operate      as     a    nonprofit\n\norganization and be exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3).\"\n\nId. at 478 (emphasis in original).\n\n           In   2007,     following    our   remand,    the    district        court\n\ncertified a class consisting of consumers whose Debt Plans were\n\nserviced by BC Mass,9 and a subclass consisting of \"all individuals\n\nwho entered into a contract for a Debt Management Plan with\n\nCambridge . . . from November 3, 1998 through September 18, 2006.\"\n\nAfter almost two years of discovery, the parties filed cross\n\nmotions for summary judgment.10 In January 2008, the district court\n\n\n     9\n       The district court's December 6, 2007 class certification\norder defined the class as \"[a]ll individuals who at any time after\nNovember 3, 1998 through to the present paid, directly or\nindirectly, any money or other valuable consideration to Brighton\nCredit Corp. of Massachusetts, Brighton Debt Management Services,\nLtd., or First Consumers Credit Management Corp. for any service\nrelated to the individual's Debt Management Plan.\"\n     10\n        During the intervening time, defendant Cambridge settled\nthe action against it and was voluntarily dismissed.           That\nsettlement did not release the Puccios or any remaining defendants.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fgranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs.       The court found that\n\nCambridge, BCMC, CBBPC and BC Mass operated as Credit Repair\n\nOrganizations within the meaning of CROA because they \"crossed the\n\nboundary from credit counseling into credit repair with their\n\ncontinued and insistent representations to consumers that their\n\nservices could only help improve clients' credit.\"      Zimmerman, 529\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 275.       The court held that Cambridge was not exempt\n\nunder CROA's provision for nonprofit organizations because it did\n\nnot \"in fact and as a matter of law, operate as a nonprofit.\"        Id.\n\nat 277.\n\n            As credit repair organizations, Cambridge, BCMC, CBBPC\n\nand BC Mass were obligated to comply with the specific statutory\n\nrequirements of CROA.      The district court found that they had not\n\ncomplied     with   any   of   CROA's   requirements.    Id.   at   278.\n\nSpecifically, they did not provide consumers with a required\n\ndisclosure statement, did not include certain required items in\n\ntheir service agreements, and did not give consumers a mandatory\n\nseparate cancellation form along with the service agreement.        Id.\n\nat 278-79.    Additionally, they violated CROA by charging up-front\n\nfees to consumers before they had fully performed the promised\n\nservices.    Id. at 279.\n\n            Turning to the provisions of CROA directed not just at\n\ncredit repair organizations, but at \"any person,\" the court found\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthat the Puccios and the corporate defendants were liable for\n\n\"mak[ing] or us[ing] . . . misleading representation[s] of the\n\nservices of [a] credit repair organization\" under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679b(a)(3) and for \"engag[ing] . . . [in a] course of business\n\nthat constitutes or results in . . .        an attempt to commit [] a\n\nfraud or deception on any person in connection with the offer or\n\nsale of the services of the credit repair organization\" under 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1679b(a)(4).      Id. at 279-80.       Specifically, the court\n\nfound that the Puccio corporations misleadingly represented to\n\nclients that they would be retaining the services of a not-for-\n\nprofit when, in fact, their accounts were immediately transferred\n\nto   a   for-profit   corporation,   id.   at   279,   and   that   such   a\n\nmisrepresentation also qualified as \"a fraud or deception,\" id. at\n\n280.     The court found that all of the corporate defendants and the\n\nPuccios were liable for the activity of Cambridge, BCMC, CBBPC and\n\nBC Mass under either of two theories: (a) because they engaged in\n\na deceptive \"course of business\" as prohibited under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679b(a)(4); or (b) because the corporations served as the alter\n\negos of the Puccios such that they and the Puccios could be held\n\ndirectly liable for Cambridge's actions by piercing the corporate\n\nveil.     Id. at 271-72.\n\n             In March 2009, the district court entered its final\n\njudgment against the Puccios, awarding damages to the plaintiffs,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fon behalf of the certified class, in the amount of $256,527,000.11\n\nThe   court    made   its   award   under   CROA's   compensatory   damages\n\nprovision which provides that \"[a]ny person who fails to comply\n\nwith any provision of this subchapter with respect to any other\n\nperson shall be liable to such other person in an amount equal to\n\nthe sum of . . . [t]he greater of . . . (A) the amount of any\n\nactual damage . . . or (B) any amount paid by the person to the\n\ncredit repair organization.\"         15 U.S.C. § 1679g(a).    The court's\n\n$256.5 million award represented the amount paid by the class\n\nplaintiffs to the defendants through December 31, 2004.12\n\n              John and Richard Puccio now appeal from the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment.          They contend, as a threshold\n\nmatter, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nbecause Cambridge is not a credit repair organization within the\n\nmeaning of CROA.      The Puccios further argue that even if Cambridge\n\nis a credit repair organization under CROA, there were disputed\n\nissues of fact that should have precluded the award of summary\n\n\n      11\n        The district court also entered judgment against               the\ncorporate defendants. They have not appealed that judgment.\n      12\n        Although the certified class covered all individuals who\npaid money to Puccio corporations \"through to the present,\" the\nplaintiffs agreed to limit the amount of damages to money paid\nthrough December 31, 2004, an amount that was specifically admitted\nby the defendants in their response to the plaintiffs' statement of\nuncontested facts.     The plaintiffs stipulated that all class\nmembers, including those who paid money after December 31, 2004,\nwould be included in the distribution of funds to the class, but\nthat \"it is clear that the amount of the overall judgment will be\nso high already that not all of it will be collectable.\"\n\n                                     -20-\n\fjudgment on the fraud claim under Section 1679b(a)(4) of CROA.\n\nTheir challenge to liability under Section 1679b(a)(3) is less\n\nstraightforward.        Primarily, the Puccios insist that the district\n\ncourt made no findings of liability under (a)(3).                 Secondarily,\n\nthey argue that even if the district court did find them liable\n\nunder (a)(3), the finding rests on the same flawed veil-piercing\n\nanalysis that the district court used in finding them personally\n\nliable under (a)(4).13\n\n                                      III.\n\n               The plaintiffs' claims under CROA present several pure\n\nquestions of law, including issues of statutory interpretation.\n\nOur review of the district court's conclusions on those issues is\n\nde novo.       Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).\n\n               We also review de novo the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment.        Cianbro Corp. v. George H. Dean, Inc., 596 F.3d\n\n10, 14 (1st Cir. 2010).        Summary judgment is appropriate when the\n\nmoving       party   demonstrates   that   there   is   no   genuine   issue   of\n\nmaterial fact, and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Torres, 561\n\nF.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 2009).           A material fact is one that would\n\naffect the outcome of the suit, while a genuine issue is one for\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            The Puccios do not specifically contest the damages award.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fwhich the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a\n\nverdict for the nonmoving party.           Cianbro, 596 F.3d at 14.\n\n            Unlike a typical case in which a defendant moves for\n\nsummary judgment, in this case the plaintiffs prevailed at summary\n\njudgment on claims for which they, as plaintiffs, would bear the\n\nburden of proof at trial.         The plaintiffs \"cannot attain summary\n\njudgment unless the evidence that [they] provide[] . . . is\n\nconclusive.\"      Torres Vargas, 149 F.3d at 35.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n            CROA was enacted in 1996 for two express purposes: first,\n\nto \"protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and\n\nbusiness practices by credit repair organizations,\" and second, to\n\n\"ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair\n\norganizations are provided with the information necessary to make\n\nan informed decision regarding the purchase of such services.\"               15\n\nU.S.C. § 1679(b).        Congress passed CROA, which became effective on\n\nApril 1, 1997, in response to mounting evidence that unscrupulous\n\nindividuals were making their fortunes by leading consumers to\n\nbelieve that they could repair a consumer's bad credit history.\n\nSee S. Rep. No. 103-209, at 7 (1993) (\"Fraudulent companies that\n\nlead consumers to believe that the companies can 'repair' bad\n\ncredit histories have bilked consumers of millions of dollars . .\n\n.   .\");   H.R.   Rep.    No.   103-486,    at   63   (1994)   (Credit   repair\n\n\"businesses, through advertisements and oral representations, lead\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fconsumers to believe that adverse information in their consumer\n\nreports can be deleted or modified regardless of its accuracy.\").\n\nIn an attempt to combat such practices, CROA requires organizations\n\nthat fall within its ambit to make certain disclosures prior to\n\ndoing business with members of the public and prohibits them and\n\npersons connected with them from engaging in deceptive practices\n\ninjurious to the public.        See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679b-1679e.\n\n              This appeal concerns two CROA provisions that explicitly\n\napply    to    persons     acting   in     connection    with   credit      repair\n\norganizations.        Those provisions state:\n\n              No person may --\n\n              . . .\n\n              (3) make or use any untrue or misleading\n              representation of the services of the credit\n              repair organization; or\n\n              (4) engage, directly or indirectly, in any\n              act, practice, or course of business that\n              constitutes or results in the commission of,\n              or an attempt to commit, a fraud or deception\n              on any person in connection with the offer or\n              sale of the services of the credit repair\n              organization.\n\nId.     As this text makes clear, in order to find liability under\n\neither provision, a court must find that the services at issue are\n\nthose    of   a   credit   repair   organization,       as   defined   by   CROA.\n\nAccordingly, we turn first to this threshold definitional question.\n\nA. Application of CROA to Cambridge\n\n              1. Language of the Act\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f              CROA applies to a category of businesses termed \"credit\n\nrepair organizations.\"             A \"credit repair organization\" is defined\n\nby the act as:\n\n              any person who uses any instrumentality of\n              interstate commerce or the mails to sell,\n              provide, or perform (or represent that such\n              person can or will sell, provide, or perform)\n              any service, in return for the payment of\n              money or other valuable consideration, for the\n              express or implied purpose of--\n\n                     (i) improving any consumer's credit\n              record, credit history, or credit rating; or\n\n                     (ii) providing advice or assistance to\n              any consumer with regard to any activity or\n              service described in clause (i) . . .\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(A).            In interpreting CROA, as with any act of\n\nCongress, \"'our analysis begins with the language of the statute.'\"\n\nZimmerman,     409   F.3d     at    475   (quoting   Hughes   Aircraft   Co.    v.\n\nJacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999)).             The words Congress used to\n\ndefine a credit repair organization must always be taken \"in their\n\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\n\nscheme.\"      David v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809\n\n(1989).    That overall scheme is a sweeping consumer protection act\n\nexplicitly intended to \"protect the public from unfair or deceptive\n\nadvertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.\"\n\n15   U.S.C.    §   1679(b).        Such   consumer   protection   statutes     are\n\nconstrued \"liberally in favor of consumers.\" Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l\n\nBank, N.A., 370 F.3d 164, 171 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\f             By its plain language, CROA applies to \"credit repair\n\norganizations.\"        15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(A).      By focusing on the word\n\n\"repair\" in the defined term, the defendants seek to draw a\n\ndistinction between purporting to repair or retroactively fix past\n\ncredit problems and purporting to improve credit in the future.\n\nThey    argue   that    Congress   intended   CROA   to   apply   to   entities\n\nperforming the function of retroactive credit repair but not those\n\ncompanies offering services aimed at improving clients' credit in\n\nthe future. In support of their theory, the defendants cite Hillis\n\nv. Equifax Consumer Servs., Inc., 237 F.R.D. 491 (N.D. Ga. 2006),\n\nin   which   the   district    court    attempted    to   articulate    such   a\n\ndistinction:\n\n             the definition of a credit repair organization\n             is narrower than a cursory reading of the\n             statute would indicate.    Specifically, when\n             the statute refers to services whose purpose\n             is to improve a consumer's 'credit record,\n             credit history, or credit rating,' these terms\n             [] refer to a consumer's historical credit\n             record.    Congress did not intend for the\n             definition of a credit repair organization to\n             sweep in services that offer only prospective\n             credit   advice   to  consumers   or   provide\n             information to consumers so that they can take\n             steps to improve their credit in the future.\n\nId. at 514.\n\n             The distinction drawn by the Hillis court, and embraced\n\nby the defendants, is unsupportable.14           By its plain terms, CROA\n\n\n       14\n        The theory put forward by the district court in Hillis\nappears to be an outlier. Cf. Helms v. Consumerinfo.com, Inc., 436\nF. Supp. 2d 1220 (N.D. Ala. 2005); Polacsek v. Dedicated Consumer\n\n                                       -25-\n\fapplies   to   organizations   that     provide,    in   exchange   for\n\nconsideration, \"any service\" for the \"express or implied purpose\"\n\nof improving a consumer's credit record, credit history, or credit\n\nrating.   15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(A).    The language of the Act does not\n\nbind the concept of an improved credit record, credit history, or\n\ncredit rating to the literal alteration (\"repair\") of an historical\n\nrecord, history, or rating.      As the district court explained,\n\n\"[t]he ostensibly forward-looking orientation\" of representations\n\nabout improving clients' credit \"does not mitigate the obvious\n\nmessage to debtors that [those] services might modify the effect of\n\ntheir past credit history on their credit score.\"        Zimmerman, 529\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 275.   Credit records are constantly changing based\n\non the ongoing performance of the consumer.        By improving credit\n\nbehavior prospectively, a consumer aims to improve a pre-existing\n\ncredit record, credit history, and/or credit rating with a more\n\nfavorable record, history, or rating in the future.        Thus, credit\n\ncounseling aimed at improving future creditworthy behavior is the\n\nquintessential credit repair service.\n\n           2. The Facts of this Case\n\n           As detailed earlier in this opinion, the undisputed facts\n\nare that in advertisements, informational materials, and employee\n\nscripts, Cambridge repeatedly represented to consumers that its\n\ndebt management services would \"restore your credit rating\" and\n\n\nCounseling, 413 F. Supp. 2d 539, 546 (D. Md. 2005).\n\n                                -26-\n\f\"improve your credit.\"    Puccio company employees were trained to\n\ntell customers that a Debt Plan \"can only help your credit.\"   At a\n\ncertain point, the employee scripts instructed that clients be\n\ntold, \"Our program is designed to help you get out of debt and\n\nimprove your credit rating.\"     Even more explicitly, the script\n\nstated, \"Over the course of the program, your credit rating will\n\nimprove.\"   Cambridge's promotional materials made promises such as\n\n\"[w]hen you join our debt management program, we'll be able to help\n\nyou reestablish your credit.\"    The Cambridge website contained a\n\nfeature which answered questions such as, \"How Can I Rebuild My\n\nCredit?\"    Their quarterly newsletter dispensed advice on the same\n\nsubject.     The welcome package mailed to customers listed \"an\n\nimproved credit profile\" as among the \"life benefits you receive by\n\nusing our program.\" BC Mass employees contacted clients' creditors\n\nto try to negotiate \"re-aging\" of accounts, a process designed to\n\nimprove credit scores by relabeling delinquent accounts as current.\n\n            The Puccios cite the disclaimer in Cambridge's contract\n\nstating that \"[t]he CLIENT'S credit rating is outside of the scope\n\nof this Agreement\" as evidence that the company did not represent\n\nthat it would improve a client's credit rating.    Apparently, the\n\nPuccios believe that a company could represent repeatedly in\n\nadvertisements, on its website, and in its employee scripts, that\n\nit would help improve clients' credit ratings, but escape liability\n\nunder CROA by inserting a disclaimer in its contract about the\n\n\n                                -27-\n\frelevance of its services to the credit rating of its clients.\n\nThat is an implausible position which captures the duplicity of the\n\nPuccios' enterprises.   Cambridge repeatedly held itself out as a\n\ncompany that would provide \"advice and assistance\" in order to\n\n\"improv[e] any consumer's credit record, credit history, or credit\n\nrating.\"   15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(A)(i)-(ii).      Those services are\n\nsquarely covered by CROA.\n\nB. Application of CROA to the Puccios\n\n           The district court found the Puccios liable for violating\n\nboth Section 1679b(a)(3), which prohibits any person from \"mak[ing]\n\nor us[ing] any untrue or misleading representation of the services\n\nof the credit repair organization,\" and Section 1679b(a)(4), which\n\nprohibits, either through an act or a course of business, the\n\ncommission or attempted commission of \"a fraud or deception\" in\n\nconnection with the offer or sale of the services of a credit\n\nrepair organization. 15 U.S.C. § 1679b(a)(4).         Because we affirm\n\nthe finding of liability under Section 1679b(a)(3), which suffices\n\nto support the judgment, we do not reach the question of the\n\nPuccios' liability under Section 1679b(a)(4).\n\n          1. The District    Court's   Finding   of    Liability   Under\nSection 1679b(a)(3)\n\n           In their opening brief on appeal, the Puccios offer no\n\nchallenge to their liability under Section 1679b(a)(3).        In their\n\nreply brief, they explain that curious omission, contending that\n\nthe district court did not actually find them liable under Section\n\n                                -28-\n\f1679b(a)(3).            That position is untenable.               The district court\n\nunambiguously held in section III.C.3.a of its opinion, entitled\n\n\"CRO Violations,\" that the \"[d]efendants betrayed [p]laintiffs'\n\ntrust when, as was its policy for all [Cambridge] clients, it\n\ntransferred       Plaintiffs'       account      to   BC   Mass,    straightforwardly\n\nviolating § 1679b(a)(3)\" by misleading consumers into thinking they\n\nwere doing business with a non-profit corporation, when, in fact,\n\ntheir        accounts    were     being    wholly     serviced     by    a    for-profit.\n\nZimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 279.                 The court then made explicit in\n\nsection III.C.3.b, entitled \"Non-CRO Violations,\" that \"[t]hose\n\nDefendants that are not themselves CROs within the meaning of CROA\n\n- namely, John and Richard Puccio, . . . are still liable for the\n\nabove violations.\"          Id. at 280.       That statement is an unmistakable\n\nfinding       that    all   of    the     defendants,      both    the   credit    repair\n\norganizations themselves, and John and Richard Puccio, violated\n\nSection 1679b(a)(3).15\n\n          2. The District Court's Decision to Pierce the Corporate\nVeil to Support Section 1679b(a)(3) Liability\n\n                The     Puccios    argue    in     the   alternative         that, if the\n\ndistrict court did find them personally liable under Section\n\n1679b(a)(3), the district court's veil piercing analysis does not\n\n\n\n        15\n        The court made one exception for an enterprise called\nSouthfork.   Zimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 280 n.27. The court\ndismissed Southfork from the case after noting that the plaintiffs\nhad not presented any evidence suggesting that the company was\nsignificantly involved in the Puccios' credit repair business. Id.\n\n                                            -29-\n\fsupport that determination.         Again, that barely developed argument\n\nappears for the first time as a footnote in their reply brief.\n\nOrdinarily, such an undeveloped argument, raised for the first time\n\nin a footnote to the defendants' reply brief, would not suffice to\n\nraise an argument, see Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., v. Mowbray, 208\n\nF.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000).        Here, however, we see no meaningful\n\ndifference between the Puccios' fully developed challenge to the\n\nveil    piercing    analysis   of    the   district   court     under   Section\n\n1679b(a)(4) and the challenge to that analysis under Section\n\n1679b(a)(3).        We   therefore     choose   to    address    the    Section\n\n1679b(a)(3) veil piercing argument of the Puccios on the merits.\n\n              To be sure, we tread carefully when determining whether\n\nit is appropriate to put aside the basic tenet of corporate law\n\nthat \"corporations - notwithstanding relationships between or among\n\nthem - ordinarily are regarded as separate and distinct entities,\"\n\nScott v. NG U.S. 1, Inc., 881 N.E.2d 1125, 1131 (Mass. 2008), and\n\nthereby to \"allow a plaintiff to pierce the corporate veil of\n\nlimited liability.\"      In re Ontos, Inc., 478 F.3d 427, 432 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).      In Massachusetts, \"the corporate veil will only be pierced\n\nin rare situations.\"       Birbara v. Locke, 99 F.3d 1233, 1239 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).16     Such situations do occur, however, and Massachusetts\n\n\n       16\n        We acknowledge the Puccios' suggestion that the veil-\npiercing question, given its relevance to the federal cause of\naction in this case under CROA, may be viewed as one of federal\ncommon law.   While \"we arguably have discretion to use federal\nlaw,\" Nisselson v. Lernout, 469 F.3d 143, 154 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\n                                      -30-\n\fhas recognized that it is the \"right and the duty of courts to look\n\nbeyond the corporate forms\" when necessary \"for the defeat of fraud\n\nor wrong, or the remedying of injustice.\"      Hanson v. Bradley, 10\n\nN.E.2d 259, 264 (Mass. 1937) (quoted in Scott, 881 N.E.2d at 1132).\n\n           Massachusetts has identified as relevant to the veil-\n\npiercing analysis a set of twelve factors.     They are: \"(1) common\n\nownership; (2) pervasive control; (3) confused intermingling of\n\nbusiness assets; (4) thin capitalization; (5) nonobservance of\n\ncorporate formalities; (6) absence of corporate records; (7) no\n\npayment of dividends; (8) insolvency at the time of the litigated\n\ntransaction; (9) siphoning away of corporation's funds by dominant\n\nshareholder; (10) nonfunctioning of officers and directors; (11)\n\nuse   of   the   corporation   for   transactions   of   the   dominant\n\nshareholders; and (12) use of the corporation in promoting fraud.\"17\n\nAtt'y Gen. v. M.C.K., Inc., 736 N.E.2d 373, 381 n.19 (Mass. 2000).\n\nLooking to some of these factors, and to the guidance provided in\n\nthe seminal Massachusetts case, My Bread Baking Co. v. Cumberland\n\n\n\n\nwe choose to apply Massachusetts law.    Id. at 154 (\"We look to\nstate law to ascertain when wrongful conduct should be imputed to\na corporation.\").\n      17\n       That list is not exhaustive, nor does every factor have to\nbe present in every veil piercing case. The list, rather, is an\nanalytical   tool  used   to   \"form   an  opinion   whether  the\n[corporation's] over-all structure and operation misleads.\" Evans\nv. Multicon Constr. Corp., 574 N.E.2d 395, 400 (Mass. App. Ct.\n1991), review denied, 577 N.E.2d 309 (1991).\n\n                                 -31-\n\fFarms, Inc., 233 N.E.2d 748, 751-52 (Mass. 1968), we find ourselves\n\nconfronted with a textbook case for lifting the corporate veil.\n\n            The undisputed evidence shows that the Puccios owned and\n\nhad \"pervasive control\" over all of the entities involved in this\n\nlitigation, including Cambridge.         John Puccio set the terms of\n\ndealing among the Puccio companies, which functioned without clear\n\nboundaries or separate corporate structures.       Those dealings were\n\nconducted   without   independent   representatives   to   protect   the\n\ninterests of the individual corporations.\n\n            Further, there was a total failure to “make clear which\n\ncorporation [was] taking action” or “to observe with care” the\n\ncorporate form. My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.       The Puccios did not\n\ndelineate between their businesses,18 channeling funds between them,\n\nusing employees interchangeably and applying funds from one entity\n\nto pay the bills for another.19     Corporate formalities of even the\n\nmost basic nature were largely nonexistent, as when Cambridge\n\npurchased BCC and CCC's nonexistent \"intangible assets\" for over\n\n$14 million.\n\n\n\n     18\n       For example, as we outlined earlier, while John Puccio was\nrunning Cambridge, that company paid $150,000 to another Puccio\nenterprise,   JRJ  Associates,   Inc.,   without  receiving   any\nconsideration for the payment.\n     19\n        As described above, at least one person who worked at\nvarious times for Cambridge, CCC, and BC Mass, received the bank\nstatements and paid the bills of one of those companies while he\nwas not an employee of that company, but was instead on the payroll\nof a different Puccio entity.\n\n                                  -32-\n\f            The facts also show an obvious \"element of dubious\n\nmanipulation     and    contrivance,         finagling,     such    that    corporate\n\nidentities are confused and third parties [could not] be quite\n\ncertain with what they [were] dealing.”                Evans v. Multicon Constr.\n\nCorp., 574 N.E.2d 395, 400 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991), review denied,\n\n577 N.E.2d 309 (1991).        When customers contracted with Cambridge,\n\ntheir accounts became wholly serviced by BC Mass.                    The plaintiffs\n\nwere utterly \"misled about which corporate entity - [Cambridge or\n\nBC Mass] - was obligated to them or was dealing with them.\"\n\nBirbara, 99 F.3d at 1239 (refusing to pierce the corporate veil in\n\nthe absence of any confusion about which corporate entity was in\n\ndealings with the plaintiffs).                The Puccios also siphoned money\n\nfrom corporate accounts to pay for personal expenses such as adult\n\nentertainment and costs associated with a yacht.\n\n            As the district court rightly emphasized, the money that\n\nwas   funneled     from    Cambridge         into   other   Puccio       entities     and\n\nultimately to the Puccios themselves cannot be reached by the\n\nsettlement   with      Cambridge       or    the    judgment   against      the   other\n\ncorporations.      In order to obtain full relief, the plaintiffs must\n\nbe able to reach the Puccios, who were the lead players in the\n\nscheme being carried out by their network of corporations.\n\n            That   logic    is    at    the    very    heart   of    the    alter     ego\n\ndoctrine.      See     1   W.M.    Fletcher,        Cyclopedia      of    the   Law    of\n\nCorporations § 41.10 (2010) (\"One rationale behind the theory [of\n\n\n                                            -33-\n\falter        ego   liability]   is   that     if   the   shareholders   or   the\n\ncorporations themselves disregard the proper formalities of a\n\ncorporation, then the law will do likewise as necessary to protect\n\nindividual and corporate creditors.\").              The corporate form should\n\nnot bar the plaintiffs from seeking the full relief to which they\n\nare entitled when the defendants themselves treated Cambridge and\n\ntheir other companies as mere shells, ignoring financial, legal and\n\npractical formalities in furtherance of their own money-making\n\nenterprise.        In short, we agree with the trenchant assessment of\n\nthe district court:\n\n               Defendants served as alter egos of the Puccios\n               and thus may be held directly liable for\n               [Cambridge's]      actions     by     piercing\n               [Cambridge's] corporate veil.      Since funds\n               were funneled out of [Cambridge] to other\n               entities   in   the   Puccios'    network  and\n               ultimately to the Puccios themselves, the\n               settlement with [Cambridge] could not provide\n               the Zimmermans with full relief and they must\n               now seek their remedy from these other\n               defendants.   The corporate form should not\n               serve as an obstacle to that relief where, as\n               here, it was a mere shell, ignored by the\n               Puccios in their everyday business dealings.\n\nZimmerman, 529 F.Supp.2d at 271-72.20\n\n                                        V.\n\n               When Cambridge held itself out as an organization that\n\ncould help consumers \"rebuild,\" \"reestablish\" and \"restore\" their\n\ncredit, it operated as a \"credit repair organization\" within the\n\n\n        20\n        The Puccios' only \"merits\" challenge to their liability\nunder Section 1679b(a)(3) was their veil piercing challenge.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fmeaning   of   CROA.     Having   made    that   threshold   determination\n\ncorrectly, the district court pierced the corporate veil to find\n\nthat the Puccios were personally liable under Section 1679b(a)(3)\n\nof CROA for a misrepresentation by Cambridge that it offered credit\n\nrepair services as a non-profit entity.           That determination was\n\nalso correct.    We therefore affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment to the plaintiffs based on the liability of the\n\nPuccios for violations of 15 U.S.C. § 1679b(a)(3).\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\f                                          Appendix\n\n Acronym        Name                                        Function       Location    Status\n BCC            Brighton Credit Corporation                 Credit         New         For-\n                                                            Counseling     York        profit\n BC Mass*       Brighton Credit Corp. of Massachusetts      Back Office    Mass        For-\n                Brighton Debt Management Services, Inc.

Duncan, Garrett Minor Smith, Michie Hamlett\nLowry Rasmussen & Twell, Joseph Seth Tusa, and Whalen & Tusa, P.C.,\nwere on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          July 27, 2010\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Appellants John and Richard Puccio\n\nappeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs, Andrew and Kelly Zimmerman, on behalf of a class of\n\nclients of Cambridge Credit Counseling Corporation (\"Cambridge\"),\n\none of the Puccios' business enterprises, pursuant to the Credit\n\nRepair Organizations Act (\"CROA\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679-1679j.          CROA\n\nwas enacted by Congress in 1996 to protect the public from unfair\n\nor deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair\n\norganizations.\n\n          Although the district court entered summary judgment\n\nagainst   the    Puccios   and   multiple   corporate   defendants    for\n\nviolations of CROA, the corporate defendants have not appealed.\n\nInstead, the Puccios appeal the judgment against them personally\n\nfor the violation of two provisions of CROA, the first making it\n\nunlawful to \"make or use any untrue or misleading representation of\n\nthe services of the credit repair organization,\" id. § 1679b(a)(3),\n\nand the second making it unlawful to \"engage . . . [in a] course of\n\nbusiness that constitutes or results in the commission of, or an\n\nattempt to commit, a fraud or deception on any person in connection\n\nwith the offer or sale of the services of the credit repair\n\norganization,\" id. § 1679b(a)(4).\n\n          The Puccios argue that they do not fall within the ambit\n\nof CROA because Cambridge, their credit counseling enterprise, does\n\nnot qualify as a \"credit repair organization\" as defined by the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fAct.    They also argue that the district court erred in piercing the\n\ncorporate veil when it found them liable for violating Section\n\n1679b(a)(4).      Finally, in their primary argument directed at their\n\nsubstantive liability under Section 1679b(a)(3), the Puccios argue\n\nthat the district court did not, in fact, find them liable under\n\nthe    \"misleading     representation\"           provision,    id.    §    1679b(a)(3).\n\nAlternatively, if the district court did find them liable under\n\n(a)(3), the Puccios argue (but only barely) that the district court\n\nagain erred in piercing the corporate veil.\n\n            After      careful    consideration,        we    affirm       the   district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.                       We conclude\n\nthat Cambridge was a \"credit repair organization\" within the\n\nmeaning    of   CROA.       We    also    conclude     that   the     district      court\n\nunambiguously        held        the      Puccios      liable        for     misleading\n\nrepresentations under Section 1679b(a)(3) of CROA, and we affirm\n\nthat    finding   of    liability        based    on   the   court's       piercing   the\n\ncorporate veil analysis.               We do not reach the Puccios' liability\n\nunder Section 1679b(a)(4), and their attendant arguments about the\n\nsummary judgment standard and corporate veil-piercing, because the\n\nPuccios' liability under Section 1679b(a)(3) fully supports the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n                                            I.\n\n            In this appeal from the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the plaintiffs, we must recite the material facts in\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, in\n\nthis case, the defendants.

The rule\n\nrequires that a party's opposition to a motion for summary judgment\n\ninclude a \"concise statement of the material facts of record as to\n\nwhich it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be\n\ntried, with page references to affidavits, depositions and other\n\ndocumentation.\"    D.

The defendants offer no\n\nother reason why we should revisit the district court's decision to\n\ndeem the facts in the plaintiffs' statement to be admitted and we\n\ndecline to do so.1\n\nA. The Puccio Companies\n\n           1. Corporate Structure\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Due to the defendants' failure to respond to the plaintiffs'\nrequests for admissions for almost two years, a period well beyond\nthat required by rule, the district court also deemed them to have\nadmitted the facts in the plaintiffs' requests for admissions.\nZimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 271.       Because we find that the\ndistrict court was well within its discretion to deem the\nplaintiffs' statement of facts admitted, and that the facts therein\nprovide an ample basis for affirming the judgment, we need not rely\non - or reach the legal issues surrounding - the deemed requests\nfor admissions. To the extent that any fact put forward in the\ndeemed statement of facts relies for record support on the requests\nfor admissions, we do not treat that fact as admitted.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f             In    the   early   1990s,    John   Puccio    controlled      several\n\nentities doing business in the arena of debt management.2                        He\n\nstarted Cambridge Credit Corp. (\"CCC\"), a New York corporation, in\n\n1993.     Later that year, he founded Brighton Credit Corp. (\"BCC\"),\n\nalso in New York.             He served as president of both for-profit\n\ncorporations.        The companies shared office space and employed\n\nalmost identical client contracts.\n\n             After CCC and BCC were ordered to cease operating by the\n\nNew York Banking Department in 1996,3 John Puccio decided to move\n\nhis     operations       to    Massachusetts      and     start    a   non-profit\n\norganization.        He and his brother Richard co-founded Cambridge,\n\nwhich adopted the Service Agreements used previously by for-profits\n\nBCC and CCC.       It provided the same debt management service as did\n\nthose companies and employed their staff.                 As he had for BCC and\n\nCCC, John Puccio served as president of the company.                        Richard\n\nPuccio was Cambridge's Vice President and strategic planner.                     He\n\nwas also a board member of the company.               In 1996, John Puccio filed\n\npapers     to     register     Cambridge   as     a    nonprofit   entity     under\n\nMassachusetts law and as a 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) non-profit entity\n\nunder federal law.\n\n\n      2\n       For reference, we have created an Appendix listing the\nentities, their acronyms, location and status.\n      3\n       The order concluded that the two companies were acting in\nviolation of prohibitions in New York law on for-profit entities\nconducting \"budget planning\" business and on conducting a \"money\ntransmission business without an appropriate license.\"\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          Shortly after the formation of Cambridge, John Puccio\n\narranged to have the new company purchase the \"intangible assets\"\n\nof BCC and CCC for $14.1 million.         Although the Intangible Asset\n\nSale Agreement purported to convey to Cambridge the goodwill in the\n\ntrademarks and copyrights of BCC and CCC, neither company had been\n\nissued any trademarks or copyrights at the time of the purchase.\n\nMoreover, the sale was concluded without negotiation and in the\n\nabsence of independent representation for Cambridge.\n\n              Around   the   same   time,   John   Puccio   also   founded\n\nCambridge/Brighton Budget Planning Corporation (\"CBBPC\") in New\n\nYork as a \"credit counseling\" agency and another \"credit counseling\n\nagency,\" Brighton Credit Management Corp. (\"BCMC\"), a Florida\n\nentity.   Both were controlled by John Puccio, who handled day-to-\n\nday operations and hiring and oversaw the general operations of the\n\nbusinesses.    They used service agreements virtually identical to\n\nthe Puccios' other concerns and advertised their affiliation with\n\neach other and with Cambridge.\n\n          All three companies, Cambridge, CBBPC, and BCMC, got\n\n\"back office support\" for their operations from yet another Puccio\n\nentity, Brighton Credit Corp. of Massachusetts (\"BC Mass\").4            BC\n\n\n     4\n        BC Mass changed its name to Brighton Debt Management\nServices, Inc. in 2003. Still later, it changed its name to First\nConsumers. BC Mass was jointly owned by John and Richard Puccio.\nAfter the first name change, John Puccio became listed as the sole\nshareholder and president of the company. Defendants conceded that\n\"the businesses were essentially the same from Brighton Credit of\nMass to Brighton DMS to First Consumers.\" For the purposes of this\n\n                                    -8-\n\fMass worked exclusively for the three Puccio companies. It did not\n\nhave clients of its own, but performed all mailing, correspondence,\n\nongoing   customer   services,   and   record-keeping   services   in\n\nconnection with the debt management service being sold by the other\n\nPuccio companies. It also handled Cambridge's \"Good Payer\" program\n\nand took care of all other matters related to client accounting,\n\nincluding the central function of communicating with creditors in\n\norder to achieve the re-aging5 of client accounts.      If a client\n\ncalled the phone number provided by Cambridge, a BC Mass employee\n\nwould answer.\n\n          John and Richard Puccio created and controlled several\n\nadditional companies. For example, Debt Relief Clearinghouse Ltd.,\n\nwas the marketing arm of the Puccio organization, while Cypress\n\nAdvertising and Promotions, Inc., placed advertisements for the\n\nPuccio credit companies.   All of the businesses shared employees\n\nand office space, and the managers of one company supervised\n\nemployees of the others.\n\n          The Puccios treated their companies interchangeably.\n\nThey charged expenses for one company to the credit card of\n\nanother, while paying the bill with a check from yet another of the\n\ncorporations.   At least one person who worked for CCC, Cambridge\n\n\nopinion, we refer to all iterations of that entity as BC Mass.\n     5\n       As we discuss in greater detail later in this opinion, re-\naging accounts involves negotiating with creditors to re-label past\ndue accounts as current.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fand   BC   Mass   at   different       times    directly   received     the    bank\n\nstatements and paid the bills of one Puccio company while he was\n\nnot an employee of that company, but instead worked for a different\n\nPuccio enterprise.        While John Puccio was running Cambridge, the\n\ncompany    paid   large   sums    of    money    to   other   Puccio-controlled\n\ncompanies without consideration.               For example, JRJ Associates,\n\nInc., a company owned by John and Richard Puccio, was paid at least\n\n$150,000 by Cambridge.           John and Richard Puccio also purchased\n\npersonal items with corporate funds.                  Personal charges from a\n\n\"gentleman's      club\"   and    for    a   yacht     appeared   on   the    Puccio\n\ncompanies' corporate credit card bills.\n\n            The    Puccios      paid    themselves      salaries      from    their\n\ncorporations.      In 2001 and 2003, they were each paid $624,000 by\n\nCambridge.     John Puccio was paid $648,000 in 2004.                  His total\n\nsalary from his credit companies for the period from 1996 to 2004\n\nwas $30,987,572, while Richard Puccio's aggregate compensation was\n\n$21,719,908.\n\n            2. Corporate Services\n\n            Cambridge, CBBPC and BCMC created individualized Debt\n\nManagement Plans (\"Debt Plans\") for clients.                     Customers were\n\ncharged an up front \"Design Fee\" for the development of the Debt\n\nPlan equal to the amount of one monthly payment as well as a ten\n\npercent monthly fee or twenty-five dollars, whichever was greater.\n\nThe plans would set a single monthly payment to be paid by the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fclient to the particular Puccio enterprise servicing that client,\n\nwhich would then be dispersed to the client's creditors.                The\n\nPuccio companies would also negotiate with a client's creditors for\n\nbetter terms on their debt through interest rate reductions or\n\ndecreases in principal.        They would also attempt to \"re-age\"\n\nclients' accounts by convincing creditors who were owed late\n\npayments to re-label the accounts as current.          In exchange for re-\n\naging, the Puccio company would commit its customers to making\n\npayments on the account for a set amount of time.\n\n              The IRS form accompanying Cambridge's application for\n\n501(c)(3) status, which was signed by John Puccio, stated that the\n\ncompany's clients would enjoy \"Improved Credit Rating.\" On its tax\n\nreturns in 2000, 2001 and 2003, Cambridge described the principal\n\nobjective of its Debt Management Program as including \"improv[ing]\n\na consumer's credit rating over time by establishing a consistent\n\npayment history.\"\n\n              Cambridge, BCMC and CBBPC advertised their ability to\n\nimprove   a    client's   credit.   The    three   companies'   promotional\n\nmaterials made promises such as \"we can help you . . . restore your\n\ncredit rating,\" and \"[w]hen you join our debt management program,\n\nwe'll be able to help you reestablish your credit.\"             The company\n\nsent out a quarterly newsletter containing advice on how \"to\n\nrebuild your credit.\"      Cambridge's website stated that \"by taking\n\nadvantage of our Debt Management Program, we can help you . . . Re-\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\festablish Your Credit.\"      The website also had a feature called\n\n\"Cambridge   Answer   Man\"   to   \"help   people   understand   the   often\n\nconfusing world of credit.\" A customer who used this feature would\n\nbe able to click for answers to questions such as \"How Can I\n\nRebuild My Credit?\" The welcome package sent to clients after they\n\nenrolled with Cambridge contained a section entitled \"A Fresh\n\nStart.\"   The materials asserted, \"that is exactly what you have\n\nreceived by joining our program\" and listed \"an improved credit\n\nprofile\" among the \"life benefits\" received by clients using\n\nCambridge's program.\n\n          The contract sent to clients contained disclaimers that\n\nstated:\n\n                 The CLIENT understands that CAMBRIDGE\n          makes no representation about any aspect of\n          the CLIENT'S credit rating.     Creditors will\n          sometimes report participation in CAMBRIDGE's\n          program as a \"consumer credit counseling\" item\n          on your credit report. Persons with perfect\n          credit histories may have their credit record\n          adversely affected. CAMBRIDGE has no control\n          over reporting or interpretation, as it is\n          strictly a creditor and lender decision. The\n          CLIENT's credit rating is outside the scope of\n          this Agreement, however, at the CLIENT's\n          request, CAMBRIDGE will provide CLIENT with\n          credit references based upon CLIENT's payment\n          history with CAMBRIDGE.\n          . . .\n                 CAMBRIDGE has not authorized any person\n          or other company to make representations on\n          its behalf concerning fees, credit, any\n          services to be performed by CAMBRIDGE or any\n          other matter. In the event you were referred\n          to   CAMBRIDGE   by   another    company,  you\n          understand that the other company was not\n          authorized to make any representations about\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          CAMBRIDGE or its services. You agree that all\n          the representations concerning fees, credit,\n          refinancing or any services to be performed by\n          CAMBRIDGE that were made by CAMBRIDGE or\n          relied upon by you when you signed this\n          Service Agreement are set forth in this\n          Agreement. . . .      All the obligations of\n          CAMBRIDGE are set forth in this agreement.\n\n          Employees of BC Mass, who responded to phone calls from\n\nCambridge, BCMC and CBBPC's clients, were trained to speak about\n\nthe benefits of re-aging accounts.   All employees were coached to\n\nanswer questions about how joining a Debt Plan might affect a\n\nclient's credit score.    The sales scripts used by the Puccio\n\ncompanies directed their employees to tell clients,\n\n          You're already behind with the bills so this\n          can only help your credit.    By making your\n          payments on time to us we will be able to\n          bring your accounts back to a current status,\n          plus establish a credit reference to back you\n          up when you apply for future financing.\n\nDepending on how far behind a client was, the script instructed an\n\nemployee to tell the client, \"[s]o long as you follow through with\n\nthe program it can only help not hurt.\"\n\n          If a client inquired about settling his or her accounts,\n\nthe Puccio employee was directed to say,\n\n          settlements can damage your credit almost as\n          much as a bankruptcy . . . Our program is\n          designed to get you out of debt and protect\n          your credit rating . . . Over the course of\n          the program your credit rating will improve,\n          making it easier to qualify for financing in\n          the future.\n\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fIf the client persisted, the script required that the employee\n\nrespond,\n\n               Our program is designed to help you get out of\n               debt and improve your credit rating. You will\n               reestablish a good payment history and improve\n               your debt to income ratio. Over the course of\n               the program your credit rating will improve.\n\nEmployees were directed to closely follow the scripts, and they\n\nwere       evaluated    on   how   well    they   adhered   to    them.    Their\n\ncompensation, at least for a time, was linked to how many customers\n\nthey enrolled because they were paid a commission from the initial\n\nfees paid by clients.         At Cambridge, employees could earn bonuses\n\nfor high sales, while low sales volumes were penalized.\n\nB. The Zimmermans6\n\n               Andrew and Kelly Zimmerman are a married couple. In late\n\n2001, they learned about Cambridge through radio, television, and\n\ninternet advertisements.            Attracted to the company's non-profit\n\nstatus and hopeful that it could help the couple deal with their\n\ndebt, Andrew Zimmerman called Cambridge's toll-free number. He was\n\neventually faxed a five-page Service Agreement, which he signed.\n\nThe    agreement       provided    that   Cambridge   would      consolidate   the\n\nZimmerman's monthly payments into a single payment, use its best\n\nefforts to reduce the amount of the monthly payment and the\n\n\n\n       6\n      Although the plaintiffs' filings indicate that their surname\nis spelled \"Zimmermann,\" we, like the district court, continue to\nuse the incorrect spelling for consistency among the multiple\nopinions arising from this action.\n\n                                          -14-\n\finterest rates being paid to creditors, and pay the Zimmermans a\n\nportion of creditor contributions obtained through Cambridge's\n\n\"Good Payer Program.\"7\n\n            When the Zimmermans returned the contract to Cambridge,\n\nthe company offered them a proposed Debt Plan with a monthly\n\npayment of $798.00.   The Zimmermans enrolled in the Debt Plan.   In\n\nreturn for its services, as described above, Cambridge charged a\n\n\"Design Fee\" in the amount of one monthly payment and a monthly\n\npayment processing fee of ten percent or twenty-five dollars,\n\nwhichever was greater.\n\n            Without their knowledge, once the Zimmermans enrolled in\n\nthe Debt Plan and paid the $798.00 Design Fee, their account was\n\ntransferred from Cambridge to BC Mass, a for-profit company.      BC\n\nMass mailed the Zimmermans a welcome packet and proceeded to\n\nadminister their account by negotiating a reduction in the interest\n\nrate on some of their debts, eliminating some of their late charges\n\nand fees, and decreasing the minimum payments on some of their\n\naccounts.   The Zimmermans were never told that their account would\n\nbe handled by a for-profit back office company, or that this\n\ncompany would be contacting their creditors and would have access\n\n\n     7\n       Under the Good Payer Program, Cambridge solicited payments\nfrom its clients' creditors in exchange for Cambridge's services.\nFor every six month period during which a client made all payments\n\"on time and in the required amount,\" Cambridge would pay them a\n\"bonus\" of fifty percent of any contributions obtained from the\nclient's creditors.    The record does not disclose any further\ndetails about this program.\n\n                                -15-\n\fto personal information about them.   To the contrary, the contract\n\nthe Zimmermans signed with Cambridge explicitly identified the\n\ncompany as a \"not-for-profit organization.\"\n\n          Approximately nine months after signing their contract\n\nwith Cambridge, the Zimmermans terminated the relationship in\n\nSeptember 2002.   They filed for bankruptcy in late 2003.\n\n                                II.\n\n          This class action law suit originated in 2003, when the\n\nZimmermans filed a complaint against John and Richard Puccio (the\n\ndefendants), Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., Cambridge/Brighton\n\nBudget Planning Corp., Brighton Credit Management Corp., Cambridge\n\nCredit Corp., Brighton Credit Corp., Brighton Debt Management\n\nServices, Ltd., Brighton Credit Corp. of Massachusetts, and several\n\nadditional corporate defendants (the corporate defendants).8      The\n\nZimmermans'   amended   complaint   charged   the   defendants   with\n\nviolations of CROA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679-1679j, and with unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices in violation of the Massachusetts\n\nConsumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\n\n          The district court initially granted the defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss the Zimmermans' federal claims, finding that, as\n\na non-profit entity, Cambridge was exempt from CROA.    On appeal of\n\nthat judgment, we vacated the district court's dismissal of the\n\n\n     8\n       The additional defendants were Debt Relief Clearinghouse,\nLtd., Cypress Advertising and Promotions, Southfork Asset\nManagement Corp., and First Consumers Credit Management Corp.\n\n                               -16-\n\fplaintiffs'     federal     claims.

We concluded\n\nthat the statutory exception to CROA liability for \"any nonprofit\n\norganization which is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)\"\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code, 15 U.S.C. § 1679(a)(3)(B)(i), did not\n\napply to the defendants simply because they had registered as\n\nsection   501(c)(3)     entities.      Zimmerman,      409    F.3d       at   475-77.\n\nInstead, we held that in order to qualify for the statutory\n\nexemption,    an   entity    \"must    actually   operate      as     a    nonprofit\n\norganization and be exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3).\"\n\nId. at 478 (emphasis in original).\n\n           In   2007,     following    our   remand,    the    district        court\n\ncertified a class consisting of consumers whose Debt Plans were\n\nserviced by BC Mass,9 and a subclass consisting of \"all individuals\n\nwho entered into a contract for a Debt Management Plan with\n\nCambridge . . . from November 3, 1998 through September 18, 2006.\"\n\nAfter almost two years of discovery, the parties filed cross\n\nmotions for summary judgment.10 In January 2008, the district court\n\n\n     9\n       The district court's December 6, 2007 class certification\norder defined the class as \"[a]ll individuals who at any time after\nNovember 3, 1998 through to the present paid, directly or\nindirectly, any money or other valuable consideration to Brighton\nCredit Corp. of Massachusetts, Brighton Debt Management Services,\nLtd., or First Consumers Credit Management Corp. for any service\nrelated to the individual's Debt Management Plan.\"\n     10\n        During the intervening time, defendant Cambridge settled\nthe action against it and was voluntarily dismissed.           That\nsettlement did not release the Puccios or any remaining defendants.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fgranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs.       The court found that\n\nCambridge, BCMC, CBBPC and BC Mass operated as Credit Repair\n\nOrganizations within the meaning of CROA because they \"crossed the\n\nboundary from credit counseling into credit repair with their\n\ncontinued and insistent representations to consumers that their\n\nservices could only help improve clients' credit.\"      Zimmerman, 529\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 275.       The court held that Cambridge was not exempt\n\nunder CROA's provision for nonprofit organizations because it did\n\nnot \"in fact and as a matter of law, operate as a nonprofit.\"        Id.\n\nat 277.\n\n            As credit repair organizations, Cambridge, BCMC, CBBPC\n\nand BC Mass were obligated to comply with the specific statutory\n\nrequirements of CROA.      The district court found that they had not\n\ncomplied     with   any   of   CROA's   requirements.    Id.   at   278.\n\nSpecifically, they did not provide consumers with a required\n\ndisclosure statement, did not include certain required items in\n\ntheir service agreements, and did not give consumers a mandatory\n\nseparate cancellation form along with the service agreement.        Id.\n\nat 278-79.    Additionally, they violated CROA by charging up-front\n\nfees to consumers before they had fully performed the promised\n\nservices.    Id. at 279.\n\n            Turning to the provisions of CROA directed not just at\n\ncredit repair organizations, but at \"any person,\" the court found\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthat the Puccios and the corporate defendants were liable for\n\n\"mak[ing] or us[ing] . . . misleading representation[s] of the\n\nservices of [a] credit repair organization\" under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679b(a)(3) and for \"engag[ing] . . .

Id. at 279-80.       Specifically, the court\n\nfound that the Puccio corporations misleadingly represented to\n\nclients that they would be retaining the services of a not-for-\n\nprofit when, in fact, their accounts were immediately transferred\n\nto   a   for-profit   corporation,   id.   at   279,   and   that   such   a\n\nmisrepresentation also qualified as \"a fraud or deception,\" id. at\n\n280.     The court found that all of the corporate defendants and the\n\nPuccios were liable for the activity of Cambridge, BCMC, CBBPC and\n\nBC Mass under either of two theories: (a) because they engaged in\n\na deceptive \"course of business\" as prohibited under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679b(a)(4); or (b) because the corporations served as the alter\n\negos of the Puccios such that they and the Puccios could be held\n\ndirectly liable for Cambridge's actions by piercing the corporate\n\nveil.     Id. at 271-72.\n\n             In March 2009, the district court entered its final\n\njudgment against the Puccios, awarding damages to the plaintiffs,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fon behalf of the certified class, in the amount of $256,527,000.11\n\nThe   court    made   its   award   under   CROA's   compensatory   damages\n\nprovision which provides that \"[a]ny person who fails to comply\n\nwith any provision of this subchapter with respect to any other\n\nperson shall be liable to such other person in an amount equal to\n\nthe sum of . . . [t]he greater of . . . (A) the amount of any\n\nactual damage . . . or (B) any amount paid by the person to the\n\ncredit repair organization.\"         15 U.S.C. § 1679g(a).    The court's\n\n$256.5 million award represented the amount paid by the class\n\nplaintiffs to the defendants through December 31, 2004.12\n\n              John and Richard Puccio now appeal from the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment.          They contend, as a threshold\n\nmatter, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nbecause Cambridge is not a credit repair organization within the\n\nmeaning of CROA.      The Puccios further argue that even if Cambridge\n\nis a credit repair organization under CROA, there were disputed\n\nissues of fact that should have precluded the award of summary\n\n\n      11\n        The district court also entered judgment against               the\ncorporate defendants. They have not appealed that judgment.\n      12\n        Although the certified class covered all individuals who\npaid money to Puccio corporations \"through to the present,\" the\nplaintiffs agreed to limit the amount of damages to money paid\nthrough December 31, 2004, an amount that was specifically admitted\nby the defendants in their response to the plaintiffs' statement of\nuncontested facts.     The plaintiffs stipulated that all class\nmembers, including those who paid money after December 31, 2004,\nwould be included in the distribution of funds to the class, but\nthat \"it is clear that the amount of the overall judgment will be\nso high already that not all of it will be collectable.\"\n\n                                     -20-\n\fjudgment on the fraud claim under Section 1679b(a)(4) of CROA.\n\nTheir challenge to liability under Section 1679b(a)(3) is less\n\nstraightforward.        Primarily, the Puccios insist that the district\n\ncourt made no findings of liability under (a)(3).                 Secondarily,\n\nthey argue that even if the district court did find them liable\n\nunder (a)(3), the finding rests on the same flawed veil-piercing\n\nanalysis that the district court used in finding them personally\n\nliable under (a)(4).13\n\n                                      III.\n\n               The plaintiffs' claims under CROA present several pure\n\nquestions of law, including issues of statutory interpretation.\n\nOur review of the district court's conclusions on those issues is\n\nde novo.

Congress passed CROA, which became effective on\n\nApril 1, 1997, in response to mounting evidence that unscrupulous\n\nindividuals were making their fortunes by leading consumers to\n\nbelieve that they could repair a consumer's bad credit history.\n\nSee S. Rep. No. 103-209, at 7 (1993) (\"Fraudulent companies that\n\nlead consumers to believe that the companies can 'repair' bad\n\ncredit histories have bilked consumers of millions of dollars . .\n\n.   .\");   H.R.

See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1679b-1679e.\n\n              This appeal concerns two CROA provisions that explicitly\n\napply    to    persons     acting   in     connection    with   credit      repair\n\norganizations.        Those provisions state:\n\n              No person may --\n\n              . . .\n\n              (3) make or use any untrue or misleading\n              representation of the services of the credit\n              repair organization; or\n\n              (4) engage, directly or indirectly, in any\n              act, practice, or course of business that\n              constitutes or results in the commission of,\n              or an attempt to commit, a fraud or deception\n              on any person in connection with the offer or\n              sale of the services of the credit repair\n              organization.\n\nId.     As this text makes clear, in order to find liability under\n\neither provision, a court must find that the services at issue are\n\nthose    of   a   credit   repair   organization,       as   defined   by   CROA.\n\nAccordingly, we turn first to this threshold definitional question.\n\nA.

As the district court explained,\n\n\"[t]he ostensibly forward-looking orientation\" of representations\n\nabout improving clients' credit \"does not mitigate the obvious\n\nmessage to debtors that [those] services might modify the effect of\n\ntheir past credit history on their credit score.\"        Zimmerman, 529\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 275.   Credit records are constantly changing based\n\non the ongoing performance of the consumer.        By improving credit\n\nbehavior prospectively, a consumer aims to improve a pre-existing\n\ncredit record, credit history, and/or credit rating with a more\n\nfavorable record, history, or rating in the future.        Thus, credit\n\ncounseling aimed at improving future creditworthy behavior is the\n\nquintessential credit repair service.\n\n           2. The Facts of this Case\n\n           As detailed earlier in this opinion, the undisputed facts\n\nare that in advertisements, informational materials, and employee\n\nscripts, Cambridge repeatedly represented to consumers that its\n\ndebt management services would \"restore your credit rating\" and\n\n\nCounseling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2511600\"><a href=\"/opinion/2511600/polacsek-v-debticated-consumer-counseling-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Md. 2005).\n\n                                -26-\n\f\"improve your credit.\"    Puccio company employees were trained to\n\ntell customers that a Debt Plan \"can only help your credit.\"   At a\n\ncertain point, the employee scripts instructed that clients be\n\ntold, \"Our program is designed to help you get out of debt and\n\nimprove your credit rating.\"     Even more explicitly, the script\n\nstated, \"Over the course of the program, your credit rating will\n\nimprove.\"   Cambridge's promotional materials made promises such as\n\n\"[w]hen you join our debt management program, we'll be able to help\n\nyou reestablish your credit.\"    The Cambridge website contained a\n\nfeature which answered questions such as, \"How Can I Rebuild My\n\nCredit?\"    Their quarterly newsletter dispensed advice on the same\n\nsubject.     The welcome package mailed to customers listed \"an\n\nimproved credit profile\" as among the \"life benefits you receive by\n\nusing our program.\" BC Mass employees contacted clients' creditors\n\nto try to negotiate \"re-aging\" of accounts, a process designed to\n\nimprove credit scores by relabeling delinquent accounts as current.\n\n            The Puccios cite the disclaimer in Cambridge's contract\n\nstating that \"[t]he CLIENT'S credit rating is outside of the scope\n\nof this Agreement\" as evidence that the company did not represent\n\nthat it would improve a client's credit rating.    Apparently, the\n\nPuccios believe that a company could represent repeatedly in\n\nadvertisements, on its website, and in its employee scripts, that\n\nit would help improve clients' credit ratings, but escape liability\n\nunder CROA by inserting a disclaimer in its contract about the\n\n\n                                -27-\n\frelevance of its services to the credit rating of its clients.\n\nThat is an implausible position which captures the duplicity of the\n\nPuccios' enterprises.   Cambridge repeatedly held itself out as a\n\ncompany that would provide \"advice and assistance\" in order to\n\n\"improv[e] any consumer's credit record, credit history, or credit\n\nrating.\"   15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(A)(i)-(ii).      Those services are\n\nsquarely covered by CROA.\n\nB. Application of CROA to the Puccios\n\n           The district court found the Puccios liable for violating\n\nboth Section 1679b(a)(3), which prohibits any person from \"mak[ing]\n\nor us[ing] any untrue or misleading representation of the services\n\nof the credit repair organization,\" and Section 1679b(a)(4), which\n\nprohibits, either through an act or a course of business, the\n\ncommission or attempted commission of \"a fraud or deception\" in\n\nconnection with the offer or sale of the services of a credit\n\nrepair organization. 15 U.S.C. § 1679b(a)(4).         Because we affirm\n\nthe finding of liability under Section 1679b(a)(3), which suffices\n\nto support the judgment, we do not reach the question of the\n\nPuccios' liability under Section 1679b(a)(4).\n\n          1. The District    Court's   Finding   of    Liability   Under\nSection 1679b(a)(3)\n\n           In their opening brief on appeal, the Puccios offer no\n\nchallenge to their liability under Section 1679b(a)(3).        In their\n\nreply brief, they explain that curious omission, contending that\n\nthe district court did not actually find them liable under Section\n\n                                -28-\n\f1679b(a)(3).            That position is untenable.               The district court\n\nunambiguously held in section III.C.3.a of its opinion, entitled\n\n\"CRO Violations,\" that the \"[d]efendants betrayed [p]laintiffs'\n\ntrust when, as was its policy for all [Cambridge] clients, it\n\ntransferred       Plaintiffs'       account      to   BC   Mass,    straightforwardly\n\nviolating § 1679b(a)(3)\" by misleading consumers into thinking they\n\nwere doing business with a non-profit corporation, when, in fact,\n\ntheir        accounts    were     being    wholly     serviced     by    a    for-profit.\n\nZimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 279.                 The court then made explicit in\n\nsection III.C.3.b, entitled \"Non-CRO Violations,\" that \"[t]hose\n\nDefendants that are not themselves CROs within the meaning of CROA\n\n- namely, John and Richard Puccio, . . . are still liable for the\n\nabove violations.\"          Id. at 280.       That statement is an unmistakable\n\nfinding       that    all   of    the     defendants,      both    the   credit    repair\n\norganizations themselves, and John and Richard Puccio, violated\n\nSection 1679b(a)(3).15\n\n          2. The District Court's Decision to Pierce the Corporate\nVeil to Support Section 1679b(a)(3) Liability\n\n                The     Puccios    argue    in     the   alternative         that, if the\n\ndistrict court did find them personally liable under Section\n\n1679b(a)(3), the district court's veil piercing analysis does not\n\n\n\n        15\n        The court made one exception for an enterprise called\nSouthfork.   Zimmerman, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 280 n.27. The court\ndismissed Southfork from the case after noting that the plaintiffs\nhad not presented any evidence suggesting that the company was\nsignificantly involved in the Puccios' credit repair business. Id.\n\n                                            -29-\n\fsupport that determination.         Again, that barely developed argument\n\nappears for the first time as a footnote in their reply brief.\n\nOrdinarily, such an undeveloped argument, raised for the first time\n\nin a footnote to the defendants' reply brief, would not suffice to\n\nraise an argument, see Waste Mgmt.

Mowbray, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (1st Cir. 2000).        Here, however, we see no meaningful\n\ndifference between the Puccios' fully developed challenge to the\n\nveil    piercing    analysis   of    the   district   court     under   Section\n\n1679b(a)(4) and the challenge to that analysis under Section\n\n1679b(a)(3).        We   therefore     choose   to    address    the    Section\n\n1679b(a)(3) veil piercing argument of the Puccios on the merits.\n\n              To be sure, we tread carefully when determining whether\n\nit is appropriate to put aside the basic tenet of corporate law\n\nthat \"corporations - notwithstanding relationships between or among\n\nthem - ordinarily are regarded as separate and distinct entities,\"\n\nScott v.

John Puccio set the terms of\n\ndealing among the Puccio companies, which functioned without clear\n\nboundaries or separate corporate structures.       Those dealings were\n\nconducted   without   independent   representatives   to   protect   the\n\ninterests of the individual corporations.\n\n            Further, there was a total failure to “make clear which\n\ncorporation [was] taking action” or “to observe with care” the\n\ncorporate form. My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752.       The Puccios did not\n\ndelineate between their businesses,18 channeling funds between them,\n\nusing employees interchangeably and applying funds from one entity\n\nto pay the bills for another.19     Corporate formalities of even the\n\nmost basic nature were largely nonexistent, as when Cambridge\n\npurchased BCC and CCC's nonexistent \"intangible assets\" for over\n\n$14 million.\n\n\n\n     18\n       For example, as we outlined earlier, while John Puccio was\nrunning Cambridge, that company paid $150,000 to another Puccio\nenterprise,   JRJ  Associates,   Inc.,   without  receiving   any\nconsideration for the payment.\n     19\n        As described above, at least one person who worked at\nvarious times for Cambridge, CCC, and BC Mass, received the bank\nstatements and paid the bills of one of those companies while he\nwas not an employee of that company, but was instead on the payroll\nof a different Puccio entity.\n\n                                  -32-\n\f            The facts also show an obvious \"element of dubious\n\nmanipulation     and    contrivance,         finagling,     such    that    corporate\n\nidentities are confused and third parties [could not] be quite\n\ncertain with what they [were] dealing.”                Evans v.

When customers contracted with Cambridge,\n\ntheir accounts became wholly serviced by BC Mass.                    The plaintiffs\n\nwere utterly \"misled about which corporate entity - [Cambridge or\n\nBC Mass] - was obligated to them or was dealing with them.\"\n\nBirbara, 99 F.3d at 1239 (refusing to pierce the corporate veil in\n\nthe absence of any confusion about which corporate entity was in\n\ndealings with the plaintiffs).                The Puccios also siphoned money\n\nfrom corporate accounts to pay for personal expenses such as adult\n\nentertainment and costs associated with a yacht.\n\n            As the district court rightly emphasized, the money that\n\nwas   funneled     from    Cambridge         into   other   Puccio       entities     and\n\nultimately to the Puccios themselves cannot be reached by the\n\nsettlement   with      Cambridge       or    the    judgment   against      the   other\n\ncorporations.      In order to obtain full relief, the plaintiffs must\n\nbe able to reach the Puccios, who were the lead players in the\n\nscheme being carried out by their network of corporations.\n\n            That   logic    is    at    the    very    heart   of    the    alter     ego\n\ndoctrine.      See     1   W.M.    Fletcher,        Cyclopedia      of    the   Law    of\n\nCorporations § 41.10 (2010) (\"One rationale behind the theory [of\n\n\n                                            -33-\n\falter        ego   liability]   is   that     if   the   shareholders   or   the\n\ncorporations themselves disregard the proper formalities of a\n\ncorporation, then the law will do likewise as necessary to protect\n\nindividual and corporate creditors.\").              The corporate form should\n\nnot bar the plaintiffs from seeking the full relief to which they\n\nare entitled when the defendants themselves treated Cambridge and\n\ntheir other companies as mere shells, ignoring financial, legal and\n\npractical formalities in furtherance of their own money-making\n\nenterprise.        In short, we agree with the trenchant assessment of\n\nthe district court:\n\n               Defendants served as alter egos of the Puccios\n               and thus may be held directly liable for\n               [Cambridge's]      actions     by     piercing\n               [Cambridge's] corporate veil.      Since funds\n               were funneled out of [Cambridge] to other\n               entities   in   the   Puccios'    network  and\n               ultimately to the Puccios themselves, the\n               settlement with [Cambridge] could not provide\n               the Zimmermans with full relief and they must\n               now seek their remedy from these other\n               defendants.   The corporate form should not\n               serve as an obstacle to that relief where, as\n               here, it was a mere shell, ignored by the\n               Puccios in their everyday business dealings.\n\nZimmerman, 529 F.Supp.2d at 271-72.20\n\n                                        V.\n\n               When Cambridge held itself out as an organization that\n\ncould help consumers \"rebuild,\" \"reestablish\" and \"restore\" their\n\ncredit, it operated as a \"credit repair organization\" within the\n\n\n        20\n        The Puccios' only \"merits\" challenge to their liability\nunder Section 1679b(a)(3) was their veil piercing challenge.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fmeaning   of   CROA.
