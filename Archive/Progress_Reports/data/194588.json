Plaintiff, a  United States\n                                  \n\ncitizen who was born  in the Dominican Republic, claims  that she\n\nwas denied  promotion on many  occasions because of  her national\n\norigin.  She brought  suit against her employer, the  Puerto Rico\n\nElectric  Power Authority (PREPA),  under Title VII  of the Civil\n\nRights Act  of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e-(2), and Law  100 of June\n\n30, 1959  of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n29,     146.1    After  a bench  trial,  the district  court gave\n\njudgment for the plaintiff and PREPA appeals.  We affirm.\n\n     PREPA now challenges the court's holding that plaintiff made\n\nout a prima facie case and its allegedly improper shifting of the\n\nburden  of proof.  Although the trial lasted four days, appellant\n\ndid not provide us with a transcript, as required by Fed. R. App.\n\nP.  10(b)(2).  We  have since obtained  it,2 have  reviewed it to\n\ncheck our  understanding of the evidence, but rely principally on\n\nthe  facts as  set forth  by the  district court,  which in  turn\n\nrelied on the post-trial briefs of counsel. \n\n      Plaintiff, a seventeen-year veteran employee of  PREPA, has\n\nheld various positions as clerk and typist.  She possesses a B.A.\n\ndegree in business administration with  a major in accounting and\n\na minor  in management and,  shortly after  commencement of  this\n\nlitigation,   obtained  her   license  as   a  Certified   Public\n\n                    \n\n     1  She also asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C.   1981 that was\ndismissed by the district court and is not a part of this appeal.\n\n     2   The transcript, filed  in the district  court on October\n13, 1992, was sent to us at our request on February 18, 1993.\n\nAccountant.   Over the years, she successfully had taken at least\n\nten  different  tests  required  for  promotion  and  always  had\n\nreceived above average evaluations  in her performance reviews as\n\na  temporary employee.  She never received a reprimand.  Prior to\n\nthis lawsuit,  plaintiff had filed 77  applications for promotion\n\nto supervisory  positions, with no  success.3  Subsequent  to the\n\nfiling of  this action in 1988,  she applied for  the position of\n\nSupervisor  of Consumer Services.   The position was  filled by a\n\nnative  Puerto Rican with seven months of employment by PREPA and\n\na B.S. degree in marine biology.\n\n     Statistical data of various  kinds were introduced at trial.\n\nOf  some  10,700  employees  in  PREPA,  100  were  in  executive\n\npositions and 2,400  in managerial positions.   All employees  in\n\nthe former group were born  in either Puerto Rico or other  parts\n\nof  the United  States;  in the  latter  group, there  were  five\n\npersons   of   Dominican   origin  occupying   what   the   court\n\ncharacterized as \"highly technical\" supervisory  positions in the\n\nfield.   There were six  other CPA's in PREPA.   All were born in\n\n                    \n\n     3    This figure  is used  by the  district  court.   In her\ntestimony, plaintiff listed 92 separate applications between 1980\nand 1989.\n     PREPA's  regulations  governing  appointment  to  managerial\nlevel positions state:\n     The interested  supervisor selects the  one that he/she\n     considers  to be  the best  candidate in  accordance to\n     the effective norms and  in accordance to the following\n     priority order:\n     ...\n     a) Regular  and temporary  managerial employees with  one or\nmore      years of service with the authority.\n     b) Non-Regular employees.\n     c) Candidates from the Registry of Eligibles.  \n\n                               -3-\n\nPuerto Rico  and held  jobs  ranging from  Executive Director  to\n\nAuditor.\n\n     The  district court  began its  legal analysis  by rejecting\n\nPREPA's contention  that plaintiff's evidence had  to be assessed\n\nunder  disparate  impact  principles  -- i.e.,  as  proof  that a\n\nfacially neutral practice had a significant discriminatory impact\n\non  applicants  for promotion  who  were of  Dominican  origin as\n\ncompared with applicants of  U.S. (including Puerto Rico) origin.\n\nPREPA argues that the  court erred in that ruling,  claiming that\n\nplaintiff challenged a specific, facially neutral practice, i.e.,\n\n\"grooming\"  allegedly  less  qualified  persons  by placing  them\n\ntemporarily in desirable positions and then ultimately appointing\n\nthem  permanently based  on  their temporary  experience.   PREPA\n\nfurther argues  that plaintiff  failed to sustain  this challenge\n\nbecause she relied on statistical data, compiled by herself, that\n\nprovided no comparison  with the relevant  pool of eligibles,  as\n\nrequired by Wards Cove Packing Co.  v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 650-\n                                             \n\n52 (1989).  \n\n     There is  some surface plausibility to this  argument but on\n\nreflection we reject it.  While a practice of hiring or promotion\n\nallowing considerable room for subjective judgment can be subject\n\nto disparate impact analysis,  Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank  &amp; Trust,\n                                                                \n\n487  U.S. 977,  990  (1988), \"grooming\"  was  merely one  of  the\n\njustifications  advanced by PREPA for  its actions.   The gist of\n\nplaintiff's  claim was that,  try as hard  as she  might, she was\n\nalways turned down in  favor of U.S.-Puerto Rico born  persons --\n\n                               -4-\n\nfor  varying and pretextual reasons having nothing to do with her\n\nperformance  or  qualifications.   It  was  the  discriminatorily\n\nmotivated  treatment of her that she sought to demonstrate by her\n\ndata,  which did not purport  to be a  broad statistical analysis\n\nbut  rather a  distillation and  summary of  her analysis  of the\n\npersonnel records of all those who were chosen instead of her.4\n\n     As  is  well  recognized,   either  a  disparate  impact  or\n\ndisparate  treatment analysis may  be applied to  any given case.\n\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336 n.15 (1977).   This\n                          \n\ncase seems to us, as it did to the district court, more suited to\n\ndisparate treatment analysis, where the plaintiff must make out a\n\nprima  facie case of discrimination, the  employer must then come\n\n                    \n\n     4    Plaintiff's  testimony   on  her  methodology  was  the\nfollowing:\n\n          Q     So  you  did  not   study  the  general\n          population  of  all  the  persons  that  were\n          competing  with you in all the positions that\n          you requested in  PREPA during  the years  in\n          controversy?\n\n          A   No because what I did was conduct a study\n          of the persons to whom positions were awarded\n          not  the  persons  who were  competing,  that\n          would  be another study. (Trans., Vol. IV, at\n          153-154.)\n\n          ...\n\n          Q  Do you have any evidence that any of these\n          persons that are born  outside Puerto Rico or\n          that are not U.S. citizens were discriminated\n          against by PREPA?\n\n          A   On that  list there is only,  as far as I\n          know  I  am  the   only  one  that  has  been\n          discriminated  against  as  to  the  others I\n          don't know. (Trans., Vol. IV, at 159.)\n\n                               -5-\n\nforward  with  some  non-discriminatory  justification,  and  the\n\nplaintiff finally is given the  opportunity to convince the trier\n\nof fact that the  justification was pretextual and that  the real\n\nreason  was discriminatory.  Texas  Dep't of Community Affairs v.\n                                                              \n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v.\n                                                              \n\nGreen, 411  U.S. 792, 802-05  (1973).  This  being the  case, the\n     \n\nsophisticated  statistical comparisons  between the  impact  on a\n\nvictim  class  and that  on  non-victim  class  eligibles in  the\n\nrelevant labor pool, as required by Wards Cove, are unnecessary.\n                                              \n\n     In reviewing  the district court's rulings in  this genre of\n\ncase,  we give  plenary review  to its  conclusion as  to whether\n\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case and \"clearly erroneous\"\n\nreview to any ultimate finding of discriminatory intent.  EEOC v.\n                                                              \n\nMetal Service  Co.,  892 F.2d  341,  345  (3rd Cir.  1990).    We\n                  \n\nconclude  that  the  district   court  correctly  identified  and\n\nexecuted the three-pronged inquiry required.  \n\n     The court  first found  present the elements  constituting a\n\nprima  facie case.  Plaintiff's  status as a  person of Dominican\n\nRepublic  origin was  clear.5   That she  was qualified  was well\n\nestablished.   That she repeatedly was rejected and those of U.S.\n\norigin promoted also was  not disputed.  The court,  referring to\n\nplaintiff's  77 rejections, to the status of the other six CPA's,\n\n                    \n\n     5   Although  PREPA claimed in  its brief that  there was no\nevidence that the supervisors making the decisions on plaintiff's\napplications  knew  she was  a  Dominican  national, counsel  for\nappellee represented without contradiction at oral  argument that\nsuch  knowledge  was  never at  issue  and  that,  in any  event,\nplaintiff's  personnel record and  the records of  others were in\nevidence and clearly showed the employees' places of birth.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nand  to plaintiff's  final  rejection as  Supervisor of  Consumer\n\nAffairs  in  favor  of  someone  with  less  job  experience  and\n\neducation,   found   the   prima   facie  case   of   intentional\n\ndiscrimination established.    At the  conclusion of  plaintiff's\n\ncase, the court denied PREPA's motion to dismiss.\n\n     The court then turned  to PREPA's proffered business reasons\n\nfor  rejecting  plaintiff.   It earlier  had recognized  that the\n\nemployer's burden was \"not one of persuasion but of production of\n\na legitimate reason\" and that,  as to plaintiff's ultimate burden\n\nto   prove  pretext   and  the  more   likely  motivation   of  a\n\ndiscriminatory reason, \"the issue is  one of credibility that the\n\ntrier  of fact will determine.\"  PREPA advances the argument that\n\n\"defendant   established  legitimate  business  reasons  for  not\n\nawarding the  management positions to plaintiff.   The plaintiffs\n\ndid  not rebut  such  proof showing  that  those reasons  were  a\n\npretext.\"  In arguing in this manner, PREPA completely misses the\n\npoint that this was a bench trial and that the district court was\n\nnot  merely passing  on  the facial  adequacy  of the  employer's\n\njustification but  had to make credibility judgments  and pass on\n\nthe genuineness of PREPA's reasons and on the presence or absence\n\nof a discriminatory motive.\n\n     As the Supreme  Court has said in  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd.  of\n                                                                 \n\nGovernors  v.  Aikens,  460  U.S. 711,  714-15  (1983)  (footnote\n                     \n\nomitted),\n\n          But  when  the  defendant  fails  to persuade  the\n     district  court to  dismiss  the action  for lack  of a\n     prima facie case, and responds to the plaintiff's proof\n     by offering evidence of  the reason for the plaintiff's\n\n                               -7-\n\n     rejection, the factfinder must  then decide whether the\n     rejection  was  discriminatory  within the  meaning  of\n     Title  VII.    At  this  stage,  the  McDonnell-Burdine\n                                                            \n     presumption \"drops from the case,\" 450 U.S., at 255, n.\n     10, and \"the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of\n     specificity.\" Id., at 255.\n                     \n     . . .\n\n     The  district court has  before it all  the evidence it\n     needs  to decide  whether \"the  defendant intentionally\n     discriminated against the  plaintiff.\"  Burdine, supra,\n                                                           \n     at 253.\n\n     The  district  court  proceeded  to  identify   each  reason\n\nadvanced by the  employer, subjected it to critical analysis, and\n\nthen evaluated their cumulative weight.   It first noted  PREPA's\n\ninitial position  that, among  the 77  positions  applied for  by\n\nplaintiff, there were eight  for which she was unqualified.   But\n\nit observed that there was  no such claim as to the  remaining 69\n\npositions.    Then the court noted PREPA's argument  that she was\n\nturned down  for the position of Supervisor  of Consumer Services\n\nin Training because,  as Clerk of Consumer  Services in Training,\n\nshe was  already performing the  tasks required of  a supervisor.\n\nAs  to  this,  it commented,  not  unfairly  we  think, that  the\n\nargument was \"disingenuous.\"  Opinion at 14.\n\n     Another   PREPA   justification   was   that   the   limited\n\navailability of  managerial jobs meant that  there was inevitable\n\nunderutilization  of certain employees.  This did not impress the\n\ncourt as a  suitable explanation for the  uninterrupted series of\n\nrejections  of plaintiff  in favor  of less  qualified employees.\n\nAnother of  PREPA's positions was that  managerial positions were\n\nawarded  to  employees with  experience in  the  job.   The court\n\nreasoned:\n\n                               -8-\n\n     The record  does not bear this assertion.   Rather, the\n     record discloses a practice of grooming individuals  by\n     placing  them temporarily  in  the  position they  were\n     ultimately  selected  for   as  a  means   of  facially\n     satisfying the experience requirement.\n\nOpinion at 16.\n\n     Still  another   PREPA  witness's  reason   for  not  acting\n\nfavorably  on one  of plaintiff's applications,  not specifically\n\ncited  by the  court, was that  her acquisition of  a CPA license\n\nindicated that  she soon  would seek greener  pastures elsewhere.\n\nThis  conclusion, remarkable when applied to one who for 17 years\n\nhad  made every attempt to improve her position within the agency\n\nand laboriously  had qualified  in a  discipline relevant  to the\n\nagency's  accounting and  auditing  functions, was  based on  one\n\nexperience  with a supervisor who, on receiving a law degree, had\n\nleft to practice law.\n\n     Two  other factors are relevant to the issues of pretext and\n\nintentional discrimination.  One is the established fact that all\n                                                                 \n\nof  plaintiff's  performance review  evaluations  had  been above\n\naverage and  that in 17 years  there had been no  reprimands.  In\n\nother  words,  the  court  on  this  record  could  exclude   the\n\npossibility that  either quality  of  performance or  personality\n\ndefects  legitimately  could  have   played  a  part  in  PREPA's\n\ndecisions.   The  fact  that many  supervisors  joined  in  these\n\nrecommendations over time, under  these circumstances, could have\n\nbeen  looked upon  as corroborative  of some  hidden, unannounced\n\npractice.  Cf. EEOC v. Metal Service Co., 892 F.2d at 350.\n                                        \n\n                               -9-\n\n     The  second factor  is  that,  although PREPA's  Affirmative\n\nAction Plan  requires a statement of reasons to be made a part of\n\nan  employee's personnel file when such  employee is rejected for\n\npromotion,  no such  statement  ever was  made.   We  would  have\n\nexpected  that  at  some  point  in  this attenuated  history  of\n\nfrustration some supervisors would have noted the bases for their\n\nadverse decisions.   This seems to  be an example of  the type of\n\ncase where \"courts  continue to express distrust, even  in white-\n\ncollar  jobs, for  selection criteria  that are  unstructured and\n\nwhere the  overwhelming number of selectors or  testers are white\n\nor  male  [i.e.,  putative  discriminators].\"   B.  Schlei  &amp;  P.\n\nGrossman, Employment Discrimination Law 25 (2d ed. 1983) (1987-89\n                                       \n\nSupp.)\n\n     The  district court's  ultimate  finding was  that from  the\n\nfacts  and  the inferences  drawn  from  PREPA's \"silence  and/or\n\nfanciful explanations  is that failure to  select [plaintiff] for\n\n77  managerial   positions  responds   [sic]  to  a   pattern  of\n\nintentional discrimination  on  the basis  of  her  nationality.\"\n\nOpinion at 16-17.  We conclude, based on all the  factors we have\n\ncited, that this judgment was  not clearly erroneous, indeed, far\n\nfrom it. \n\n     In so concluding, we note that even  if the employer has met\n\nits burden  of articulating a nondiscriminatory  business reason,\n\nthe trier  of fact  may consider  the prima  facie case plus  the\n\ncross  examination  of  defendant  and arrive  at  a  supportable\n\ndetermination  of discrimination.

Plaintiff, a  United States\n                                  \n\ncitizen who was born  in the Dominican Republic, claims  that she\n\nwas denied  promotion on many  occasions because of  her national\n\norigin.  She brought  suit against her employer, the  Puerto Rico\n\nElectric  Power Authority (PREPA),  under Title VII  of the Civil\n\nRights Act  of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e-(2), and Law  100 of June\n\n30, 1959  of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n29,     146.1    After  a bench  trial,  the district  court gave\n\njudgment for the plaintiff and PREPA appeals.  We affirm.\n\n     PREPA now challenges the court's holding that plaintiff made\n\nout a prima facie case and its allegedly improper shifting of the\n\nburden  of proof.  Although the trial lasted four days, appellant\n\ndid not provide us with a transcript, as required by Fed. R. App.\n\nP.  10(b)(2).  We  have since obtained  it,2 have  reviewed it to\n\ncheck our  understanding of the evidence, but rely principally on\n\nthe  facts as  set forth  by the  district court,  which in  turn\n\nrelied on the post-trial briefs of counsel. \n\n      Plaintiff, a seventeen-year veteran employee of  PREPA, has\n\nheld various positions as clerk and typist.  She possesses a B.A.\n\ndegree in business administration with  a major in accounting and\n\na minor  in management and,  shortly after  commencement of  this\n\nlitigation,   obtained  her   license  as   a  Certified   Public\n\n                    \n\n     1  She also asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C.   1981 that was\ndismissed by the district court and is not a part of this appeal.\n\n     2   The transcript, filed  in the district  court on October\n13, 1992, was sent to us at our request on February 18, 1993.\n\nAccountant.   Over the years, she successfully had taken at least\n\nten  different  tests  required  for  promotion  and  always  had\n\nreceived above average evaluations  in her performance reviews as\n\na  temporary employee.  She never received a reprimand.  Prior to\n\nthis lawsuit,  plaintiff had filed 77  applications for promotion\n\nto supervisory  positions, with no  success.3  Subsequent  to the\n\nfiling of  this action in 1988,  she applied for  the position of\n\nSupervisor  of Consumer Services.   The position was  filled by a\n\nnative  Puerto Rican with seven months of employment by PREPA and\n\na B.S. degree in marine biology.\n\n     Statistical data of various  kinds were introduced at trial.\n\nOf  some  10,700  employees  in  PREPA,  100  were  in  executive\n\npositions and 2,400  in managerial positions.   All employees  in\n\nthe former group were born  in either Puerto Rico or other  parts\n\nof  the United  States;  in the  latter  group, there  were  five\n\npersons   of   Dominican   origin  occupying   what   the   court\n\ncharacterized as \"highly technical\" supervisory  positions in the\n\nfield.   There were six  other CPA's in PREPA.   All were born in\n\n                    \n\n     3    This figure  is used  by the  district  court.   In her\ntestimony, plaintiff listed 92 separate applications between 1980\nand 1989.\n     PREPA's  regulations  governing  appointment  to  managerial\nlevel positions state:\n     The interested  supervisor selects the  one that he/she\n     considers  to be  the best  candidate in  accordance to\n     the effective norms and  in accordance to the following\n     priority order:\n     ...\n     a) Regular  and temporary  managerial employees with  one or\nmore      years of service with the authority.\n     b) Non-Regular employees.\n     c) Candidates from the Registry of Eligibles.  \n\n                               -3-\n\nPuerto Rico  and held  jobs  ranging from  Executive Director  to\n\nAuditor.\n\n     The  district court  began its  legal analysis  by rejecting\n\nPREPA's contention  that plaintiff's evidence had  to be assessed\n\nunder  disparate  impact  principles  -- i.e.,  as  proof  that a\n\nfacially neutral practice had a significant discriminatory impact\n\non  applicants  for promotion  who  were of  Dominican  origin as\n\ncompared with applicants of  U.S. (including Puerto Rico) origin.\n\nPREPA argues that the  court erred in that ruling,  claiming that\n\nplaintiff challenged a specific, facially neutral practice, i.e.,\n\n\"grooming\"  allegedly  less  qualified  persons  by placing  them\n\ntemporarily in desirable positions and then ultimately appointing\n\nthem  permanently based  on  their temporary  experience.   PREPA\n\nfurther argues  that plaintiff  failed to sustain  this challenge\n\nbecause she relied on statistical data, compiled by herself, that\n\nprovided no comparison  with the relevant  pool of eligibles,  as\n\nrequired by Wards Cove Packing Co.  v.

We\n                  \n\nconclude  that  the  district   court  correctly  identified  and\n\nexecuted the three-pronged inquiry required.  \n\n     The court  first found  present the elements  constituting a\n\nprima  facie case.  Plaintiff's  status as a  person of Dominican\n\nRepublic  origin was  clear.5   That she  was qualified  was well\n\nestablished.   That she repeatedly was rejected and those of U.S.\n\norigin promoted also was  not disputed.  The court,  referring to\n\nplaintiff's  77 rejections, to the status of the other six CPA's,\n\n                    \n\n     5   Although  PREPA claimed in  its brief that  there was no\nevidence that the supervisors making the decisions on plaintiff's\napplications  knew  she was  a  Dominican  national, counsel  for\nappellee represented without contradiction at oral  argument that\nsuch  knowledge  was  never at  issue  and  that,  in any  event,\nplaintiff's  personnel record and  the records of  others were in\nevidence and clearly showed the employees' places of birth.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nand  to plaintiff's  final  rejection as  Supervisor of  Consumer\n\nAffairs  in  favor  of  someone  with  less  job  experience  and\n\neducation,   found   the   prima   facie  case   of   intentional\n\ndiscrimination established.    At the  conclusion of  plaintiff's\n\ncase, the court denied PREPA's motion to dismiss.\n\n     The court then turned  to PREPA's proffered business reasons\n\nfor  rejecting  plaintiff.   It earlier  had recognized  that the\n\nemployer's burden was \"not one of persuasion but of production of\n\na legitimate reason\" and that,  as to plaintiff's ultimate burden\n\nto   prove  pretext   and  the  more   likely  motivation   of  a\n\ndiscriminatory reason, \"the issue is  one of credibility that the\n\ntrier  of fact will determine.\"  PREPA advances the argument that\n\n\"defendant   established  legitimate  business  reasons  for  not\n\nawarding the  management positions to plaintiff.   The plaintiffs\n\ndid  not rebut  such  proof showing  that  those reasons  were  a\n\npretext.\"  In arguing in this manner, PREPA completely misses the\n\npoint that this was a bench trial and that the district court was\n\nnot  merely passing  on  the facial  adequacy  of the  employer's\n\njustification but  had to make credibility judgments  and pass on\n\nthe genuineness of PREPA's reasons and on the presence or absence\n\nof a discriminatory motive.\n\n     As the Supreme  Court has said in  U.S. Postal Serv.

It first noted  PREPA's\n\ninitial position  that, among  the 77  positions  applied for  by\n\nplaintiff, there were eight  for which she was unqualified.   But\n\nit observed that there was  no such claim as to the  remaining 69\n\npositions.    Then the court noted PREPA's argument  that she was\n\nturned down  for the position of Supervisor  of Consumer Services\n\nin Training because,  as Clerk of Consumer  Services in Training,\n\nshe was  already performing the  tasks required of  a supervisor.\n\nAs  to  this,  it commented,  not  unfairly  we  think, that  the\n\nargument was \"disingenuous.\"  Opinion at 14.\n\n     Another   PREPA   justification   was   that   the   limited\n\navailability of  managerial jobs meant that  there was inevitable\n\nunderutilization  of certain employees.  This did not impress the\n\ncourt as a  suitable explanation for the  uninterrupted series of\n\nrejections  of plaintiff  in favor  of less  qualified employees.\n\nAnother of  PREPA's positions was that  managerial positions were\n\nawarded  to  employees with  experience in  the  job.   The court\n\nreasoned:\n\n                               -8-\n\n     The record  does not bear this assertion.   Rather, the\n     record discloses a practice of grooming individuals  by\n     placing  them temporarily  in  the  position they  were\n     ultimately  selected  for   as  a  means   of  facially\n     satisfying the experience requirement.\n\nOpinion at 16.\n\n     Still  another   PREPA  witness's  reason   for  not  acting\n\nfavorably  on one  of plaintiff's applications,  not specifically\n\ncited  by the  court, was that  her acquisition of  a CPA license\n\nindicated that  she soon  would seek greener  pastures elsewhere.\n\nThis  conclusion, remarkable when applied to one who for 17 years\n\nhad  made every attempt to improve her position within the agency\n\nand laboriously  had qualified  in a  discipline relevant  to the\n\nagency's  accounting and  auditing  functions, was  based on  one\n\nexperience  with a supervisor who, on receiving a law degree, had\n\nleft to practice law.\n\n     Two  other factors are relevant to the issues of pretext and\n\nintentional discrimination.  One is the established fact that all\n                                                                 \n\nof  plaintiff's  performance review  evaluations  had  been above\n\naverage and  that in 17 years  there had been no  reprimands.  In\n\nother  words,  the  court  on  this  record  could  exclude   the\n\npossibility that  either quality  of  performance or  personality\n\ndefects  legitimately  could  have   played  a  part  in  PREPA's\n\ndecisions.   The  fact  that many  supervisors  joined  in  these\n\nrecommendations over time, under  these circumstances, could have\n\nbeen  looked upon  as corroborative  of some  hidden, unannounced\n\npractice.  Cf. EEOC v. Metal Service Co., 892 F.2d at 350.\n                                        \n\n                               -9-\n\n     The  second factor  is  that,  although PREPA's  Affirmative\n\nAction Plan  requires a statement of reasons to be made a part of\n\nan  employee's personnel file when such  employee is rejected for\n\npromotion,  no such  statement  ever was  made.   We  would  have\n\nexpected  that  at  some  point  in  this attenuated  history  of\n\nfrustration some supervisors would have noted the bases for their\n\nadverse decisions.   This seems to  be an example of  the type of\n\ncase where \"courts  continue to express distrust, even  in white-\n\ncollar  jobs, for  selection criteria  that are  unstructured and\n\nwhere the  overwhelming number of selectors or  testers are white\n\nor  male  [i.e.,  putative  discriminators].\"   B.  Schlei  &amp;  P.\n\nGrossman, Employment Discrimination Law 25 (2d ed. 1983) (1987-89\n                                       \n\nSupp.)\n\n     The  district court's  ultimate  finding was  that from  the\n\nfacts  and  the inferences  drawn  from  PREPA's \"silence  and/or\n\nfanciful explanations  is that failure to  select [plaintiff] for\n\n77  managerial   positions  responds   [sic]  to  a   pattern  of\n\nintentional discrimination  on  the basis  of  her  nationality.\"\n\nOpinion at 16-17.  We conclude, based on all the  factors we have\n\ncited, that this judgment was  not clearly erroneous, indeed, far\n\nfrom it. \n\n     In so concluding, we note that even  if the employer has met\n\nits burden  of articulating a nondiscriminatory  business reason,\n\nthe trier  of fact  may consider  the prima  facie case plus  the\n\ncross  examination  of  defendant  and arrive  at  a  supportable\n\ndetermination  of discrimination.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255 n.10.\n                                          \n\n                               -10-\n\nOur  own jurisprudence makes it  clear that there  is no absolute\n\nrule as  to the necessary  composition of sufficient  evidence of\n\ndiscrimination  and  that we  look to  the  evidence as  a whole.\n\nGoldman v.

More  particularly,\n\ndepending on the facts, the making of a prima facie case together\n\nwith   evidence   of   pretext   may  raise   an   inference   of\n\ndiscrimination.

Not only is there\n\nplaintiff's history of repeated  failed efforts rivaling those of\n\nSisyphus,  but the variety of reasons offered by defendant do not\n\nwithstand  scrutiny  and  have  nothing to  do  with  competence,\n\ncharacter,  or personality.
