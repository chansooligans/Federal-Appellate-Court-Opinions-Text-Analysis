Appellant,  a\n                                           \n\nsecurity  guard injured on the  job at a  United States naval\n\nstation  in  Puerto  Rico,  brought  this  negligence  action\n\nagainst  the  United States  and  others  after he  collected\n\nbenefits  under Puerto  Rico's workers'  compensation system.\n\nThe  United States District Court for  the District of Puerto\n\nRico granted summary judgment  for the United States, finding\n\nthat the United  States was appellant's \"statutory  employer\"\n\nand  thus immune  from suit  under the Puerto  Rico Workmen's\n\nCompensation Act.  Appellant argues on  appeal that the court\n\nmisapplied  Puerto Rico  law, and,  in the  alternative, that\n\nfederal law preempts the  statutory employer immunity rule of\n\nPuerto Rico law.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment.\n\n                              I.\n\n          In 1988, appellant David Vega-Mena  was employed by\n\nVigilantes,  Inc. (\"Vigilantes\"), a Puerto Rican corporation,\n\nas a security guard.  Pursuant to  a contract with the United\n\nStates  of   America,  Vigilantes  provided   security  guard\n\nservices at the United  States Naval Station, Roosevelt Roads\n\nin Ceiba, Puerto Rico.   On the evening of October 13,  1988,\n\nVega-Mena was  performing his duties  as a security  guard at\n\nthe Roosevelt Roads naval station when he fell into a tank of\n\nwaste diesel fuel and sustained serious injuries.  \n\n          Vigilantes was an insured employer pursuant to  the\n\nPuerto Rico Workmen's Compensation Act (\"PRWCA\"), 11 L.P.R.A.\n\n                             -3-\n\n   1 et seq., and  Vega-Mena applied for,  and collected, all\n            \n\nthe  benefits available to  him as an  employee of Vigilantes\n\nunder the PRWCA.  Thereafter,  in October 1990, Vega-Mena and\n\nother  plaintiffs brought  this  civil action  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\nthe United States, Vigilantes,  and certain other defendants.\n\nPlaintiffs  alleged  that defendants'  negligence  had caused\n\nVega-Mena's  injuries.   For  reasons  not  relevant to  this\n\nappeal, the complaint was amended in April 1991 to name Vega-\n\nMena  as  the sole  plaintiff and  Vigilantes and  the United\n\nStates as the only defendants.\n\n          Both  the original  and amended  complaints alleged\n\nthat  the  district court  had  jurisdiction  pursuant to  28\n\nU.S.C.    1346, the  jurisdictional provision of  the Federal\n\nTort Claims Act.  The complaints also referred to 28 U.S.C.  \n\n2671, which  defines terms  used in  the Federal Tort  Claims\n\nAct.  The only cause of action alleged was for \"negligence.\"\n\n          The  district court  dismissed  the claims  against\n\nVigilantes  on jurisdictional  grounds.   Vega-Mena  does not\n\nappeal from that  ruling.   In July 1991,  the United  States\n\nmoved for summary  judgment on  the claims against  it.   The\n\ngovernment argued that the Puerto Rico Workmen's Compensation\n\nAct entitled  it  to \"statutory  employer\"  immunity  against\n\nappellant's action.  Vega-Mena replied that the United States\n\ndid not meet  the requirements of  Puerto Rico for  statutory\n\n                             -4-\n\nemployer  status.   In  the  alternative,  he contended,  the\n\nLongshore and  Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,  33 U.S.C.  \n\n901 et seq.     which applied to his case,  appellant argued,\n           \n\nby  force  of the  Defense  Bases Act,  42  U.S.C.    1651   \n\npreempted Puerto Rico's statutory employer rule, disentitling\n\nthe United States to statutory employer immunity.  \n\n          The district court granted  summary judgment to the\n\nUnited States, finding no genuine issue of  material fact and\n\nholding  that  the  PRWCA  provided the  United  States  with\n\nstatutory   employer  immunity.      The  court   noted  that\n\nplaintiff's original and amended complaints made no reference\n\nto the  Longshoreman and Harbor Workers'  Compensation Act or\n\nthe  Defense Bases  Act, but stated  that \"the  outcome would\n\nhave been the same\" even if  he had \"brought the claim\" under\n\nthose acts.   Appellant  Vega-Mena appeals from  the district\n\ncourt's final order to the extent it granted summary judgment\n\nfor appellee, the United States.\n\n                             II.\n\nA.  Puerto Rico Statutory Employer Doctrine\n                                           \n\n          Vega-Mena   contends   that   the  district   court\n\nmisconstrued Puerto Rican law  in determining that the United\n\nStates  was  immune  as  a  \"statutory  employer\"  from  tort\n\nliability for appellant's injuries. \n\n          Under  the workers'  compensation scheme  in Puerto\n\nRico, when an employee suffers an injury, illness, disability\n\n                             -5-\n\nor death  as a result  of \"any  act or  function inherent  in\n\n[his]  work,\" and his  employer is insured  according to law,\n\nthe  employee's right  to compensation  from the  employer is\n\nlimited to  the statutory  compensation  offered through  the\n\nState Insurance Fund.  11 L.P.R.A.   2, 21; Santiago Hodge v.\n                                                          \n\nParke Davis &amp; Co., 126 D.P.R. 1 (1990)  (hereinafter Santiago\n                                                             \n\nHodge P.R.)

The  injured worker  lacks  a cause  of action\n         \n\nagainst his employer for damages regardless of the employer's\n\ndegree  of negligence.

The  PRWCA does not,  however, prevent  the\n\ninjured  worker  from suing  a third  party  in tort  for the\n\nworker's insured injuries, such  a defendant being a stranger\n\nto the  employer-employee relationship.

See Santiago  Hodge v. Parke Davis &amp;  Co., 859\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1026,  1029 (1st Cir. 1988)  (hereinafter Santiago Hodge\n                                                             \n\nI).   The courts took note  of the fact that  a contractor is\n \n\nnot   only  compelled   to  provide   workmen's  compensation\n\ninsurance for his own employees, see 11 L.P.R.A.   19, but is\n                                    \n\nalso  \"subsidiarily liable for the premium payments ('taxes')\n                   \n\nof the workers  of a  person who 'contracted'  with him  [the\n\ncontractor] or  the workers  of 'a contractor  or independent\n\nsubcontractor'  hired  by  him   when  the  latter  were  not\n\ninsured[.]\"   Santiago Hodge P.R.,  reprinted in 909  F.2d at\n                                                \n\n637 (emphasis in  original); see 11 L.P.R.A.   20.2  The term\n                                \n\n                    \n\n          the   workman   or   employee    or   his\n          beneficiaries   to  institute   the  same\n          action . . . .\n\n2.  11 L.P.R.A.   20 provides:\n\n               Every  insured  employer  shall,  on\n          reporting his annual payrolls, include in\n          said payrolls  the wages paid  to all the\n          workmen  and  employees  working  for  or\n          employed  by him,  whether by the  job or\n          under some person  with whom the employer\n          contracted  for  the  job,  or   under  a\n          contractor  or  independent subcontractor\n          employed or contracted by  said employer;\n          and  all accounts  or taxes  collected by\n          the   State   shall  be   based   on  the\n\n                             -7-\n\n\"statutory employer\" is thus  used by the Puerto  Rico courts\n\nto  refer to \"the principal contractor and to distinguish him\n\nfrom the  subcontractor, the real or  contractual employer of\n\nan   employee  who  seeks  compensation  for  a  work-related\n\naccident, when  the principal contractor may  be protected by\n\nthe employer  immunity.\"   Santiago Hodge P.R.,  reprinted in\n                                                             \n\n909  F.2d  at  638.

The relevant provision in the contract reads:\n\n     H.18  INSURANCE\n                    \n          Within fifteen  (15) days  after the award  of this\n     contract, the Contractor  [Vigilantes] shall furnish the\n     OIC [a United  States government agency] certificate  of\n     insurance as evidence of  the existence of the following\n     insurance coverage in amounts  not less than the amounts\n     specified below in accordance with the \"INSURANCE - WORK\n     ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION\" clause, Section I.\n\n                           COVERAGE\nCOVERAGE       PER PERSON     PER ACCIDENT    PROPERTY\n\nComprehensive  $300,000       $1,000,000      $100,000 \nGeneral \nLiability\n\nAutomobile     $300,000       $1,000,000      $100,000\nLiability\n\nWorker's       AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW\nCompensation\n\n(Other as required by State Law)\n\n                             -10-\n\ninjury,  brought  his claim  for compensation  and recovered.\n\nGiven  the terms of the  contract between the  parties, it is\n\nclear that  under Puerto Rico  law the requisite  legal nexus\n\nexisted between  the United  States and Vigilantes,  and thus\n\nthat the  United States  was properly  found by  the district\n\ncourt to be immune as appellant's statutory employer.\n\n          Appellant  makes only  one attack  on the  district\n\ncourt's application of Puerto Rico law to  the facts, arguing\n\nthat the  contract between  Vigilantes and the  United States\n\nwas  essentially  a  \"contract  for hire\"  recognized  by  31\n\nL.P.R.A.    4111, and that this type of contract creates only\n\na   relationship   of   employer-employee,  not   contractor-\n\nsubcontractor.4      However,   section  4111  only  entitles\n\n                    \n\nThe Certificate  of Insurance  shall provide for  thirty days\nwritten notice to the  OIC by the insurance company  prior to\ncancellation or  material change  in policy coverage.   Other\nrequirements   and   information   are   contained   in   the\naforementioned \"Insurance\" clause.\n\n4.  31 L.P.R.A.   4111 provides:\n\n               Period  of  contract  for  services;\n                                                   \n          remuneration    The services  of servants\n                      \n          and  laborers may  be  contracted  for  a\n          fixed period  of time, or without a fixed\n          period.  A hiring for life shall be void.\n          Professional  services,  as  regards  the\n          remuneration  therefor, shall  be subject\n          to  the  agreement  of  the  parties; and\n          where  there  is   no  agreement  as   to\n          remuneration,  and a  disagreement should\n          arise  respecting  the  same,  the  party\n          entitled to such remuneration may sue and\n          recover  from  the   adverse  party   the\n          reasonable value of such services  in any\n          court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n                             -11-\n\nservants  and laborers  to  collect the  reasonable value  of\n\ntheir  services  from an  employer  if  there  is no  written\n\nemployment agreement,  and prohibits  \"hiring for life.\"   31\n\nL.P.R.A.    4111.  It  does not in any way  alter or void the\n\nterms of the  written contract between the  United States and\n\nVigilantes,   which   clearly   establishes   a   contractor-\n\nsubcontractor relationship sufficient  to entitle the  United\n\nStates  to  statutory  employer  immunity under  Puerto  Rico\n\nlaw.5\n\n          We  find  no  error,  therefore,  in  the  district\n\ncourt's  holding  that, under  Puerto  Rico  law, the  United\n\nStates  is immune  as  a \"statutory  employer\"  from suit  by\n\nappellant under Puerto Rican tort law.\n\nB.

The  district court applied\n\nPuerto  Rico law  because  appellant's  complaint stated  its\n\n                    \n\n5.  Appellant  argues  that  the  United  States  waived  the\naffirmative defense of statutory employer immunity by failing\nto raise  it in its answer  to the complaint.   We decline to\nconsider appellant's  argument because  he never  advanced it\nbefore the district court.   Clauson v. Smith, 823  F.2d 660,\n                                             \n666 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                             -12-\n\nclaim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims\n\nAct  (\"FTCA\").      The  complaint   expressly  invoked   the\n\njurisdictional  provision  of the  FTCA,  28  U.S.C.    1346,\n\nwithout  mentioning any other federal or state law.  Under 28\n\nU.S.C.    1346(b), the  district court has  jurisdiction over\n\nactions against the United States for money damages:\n\n          for   injury  or  loss  of  property,  or\n          personal  injury or  death caused  by the\n          negligent or wrongful act or  omission of\n          any  employee  of  the  Government  while\n          acting within the scope of his  office or\n          employment, under circumstances where the\n                                                   \n          United States, if a private person, would\n                                                   \n          be liable  to the claimant  in accordance\n                                                   \n          with the  law of the place  where the act\n                                                   \n          or omission occurred.\n                              \n\n28 U.S.C.   1346(b) (emphasis supplied).   The district court\n\napplied  the law  of  the place  where  the act  or  omission\n\noccurred, Puerto Rico,  and reached the  conclusion, affirmed\n\nsupra, that  under  Puerto Rico  law  the United  States  was\n     \n\nimmune as a statutory employer.\n\n          Appellant concedes  that he sued the  United States\n\npursuant to the  FTCA and that the  FTCA mandates application\n\nof  local law.   However,  he argues:  (1) the  Longshore and\n\nHarbor Workers'  Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\"), 33  U.S.C.   901\n\net  seq., also  applies  to this  case,  as extended  by  the\n        \n\nDefense Bases Act,  42 U.S.C.   1651  et seq.; (2) the  LHWCA\n                                             \n\nexclusive liability provision, 33 U.S.C.   905(a), entitles a\n\ncontractor  to  statutory  employer   immunity  only  if  the\n\nsubcontractor actually fails to secure payment to the injured\n\n                             -13-\n\nworker; (3) the subcontractor  here, Vigilantes, did not fail\n\nto secure compensation payments for appellant; (4) therefore,\n\nunder  the  LHWCA,  the  United States  is  not  immune  from\n\nappellant's  suit for  damages; and, (5)  since the  LHWCA is\n\nfederal law, it preempts the inconsistent PRWCA rule and thus\n\nshould have been applied by the district court.\n\n          Appellant's  preemption argument  presupposes that,\n\nbecause his accident occurred on a naval base in Puerto Rico,\n\nthe Defense Bases  Act, 42  U.S.C.   1651  et seq.,  applies,\n                                                  \n\nmandating application  of the Longshore  and Harbor  Workers'\n\nCompensation  Act.     See  42  U.S.C.     1651(a).6     This\n                          \n\nsupposition may or may not be so.  It can be argued that, for\n\n                    \n\n6.  42 U.S.C.   1651 provides that:\n\n          (a)  Except  as   herein  modified,   the\n          provisions  of   the  Longshoremen's  and\n          Harbor    Workers'   Compensation    Act,\n          approved March 4,  1927 (44 Stat.  1424),\n          as amended, shall apply in respect to the\n          injury  or death of  any employee engaged\n          in any employment   \n               (2) upon any  lands occupied or used\n          by  the  United  States  for  military or\n          naval  purposes  in   any  Territory   or\n          possession outside the continental United\n          States (including the United States Naval\n          Operating Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and\n          the Canal Zone); \n          . . . .\n\nSection 1651  also makes the LHWCA applicable to employees of\ncontractors  and  subcontractors  on  certain   public  works\nprojects outside the continental United States.   42 U.S.C.  \n1651(a)(3)-(a)(5).      42   U.S.C.      1651(b)(4)   defines\n\"continental United  States\" as \"the States  and the District\nof Columbia.\"\n\n                             -14-\n\nthe narrow and specialized purposes of the Defense Bases Act,\n\nPuerto Rico  is not  a \"Territory or  possession outside  the\n\ncontinental United States\" as  those terms are there intended\n\nto  be  understood.7    We  need  not,  however,  decide this\n\n                    \n\n7.  Appellant asserts without  analysis that bases in  Puerto\nRico  \"obviously\" fall  within the  definition of  \"any lands\noccupied or used by  the United States for military  or naval\npurposes  in   any  Territory   or  possession   outside  the\ncontinental  United States.\"  The  question is not so simple,\nhowever.    The Defense  Bases Act  applies  to bases  in any\n\"territory,\"  but that term is not defined by the Act nor has\nappellant cited  any cases  interpreting it in  that context.\nAs we have noted before:\n\n          The  term \"territory\"  does  not  have  a\n          fixed and technical  meaning accorded  to\n          it in all circumstances, and  thus Puerto\n          Rico may be  found to be  included within\n          one   act   whose  coverage   extends  to\n          territories  of  the  United  States  and\n          excluded  from  another.

Here, the  only cause of action against  the United\n\nStates  is  based  on  Puerto  Rico  negligence  law  as made\n\napplicable by the Federal Tort Claims Act.  \"[W]hen state law\n\ncreates a cause  of action, the State  is free to define  the\n\ndefenses to  that claim,  including the defense  of immunity,\n\nunless, of course, the state rule is in conflict with federal\n\nlaw.\"     Ferri  v.

As\n\n                    \n\n          damages against such third person.\n\n                             -19-\n\nexplained in  Part II.A. supra, under  Puerto Rico's workers'\n                              \n\ncompensation  scheme  all  employers  must  insure their  own\n\nemployees  and,   in  return,  their   liability  for   their\n\nemployees'  injuries  is  limited  by  11  L.P.R.A.     21 to\n\nworkers' compensation payments.  11 L.P.R.A.   21 provides:\n\n            21.   Exclusiveness of remedy   When an\n                                         \n          employer insures his workmen or employees\n          in  accordance  with  this  chapter,  the\n          right   herein   established  to   obtain\n          compensation  shall  be  the only  remedy\n          against the employer, even in those cases\n          where maximum  compensations and benefits\n          have    been   granted    in   accordance\n          thereof; . . . . \n\nIn shorthand,  11 L.P.R.A.   21  entitles complying employers\n\nto \"immunity\" from damages actions  by injured employees.  In\n\naddition,  a   contractor  is  secondarily  liable   for  the\n\ninsurance premium payments for its  subcontractor's employees\n\nwhen the subcontractor is not properly insured.   11 L.P.R.A.\n\n  20.   As interpreted by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, this\n\nmutual obligation  entitles contractors to  the same immunity\n\nenjoyed by employers and so such contractors are deemed to be\n\n\"employers\" for the purposes  of 11 L.P.R.A.   21.  They have\n\nso-called  \"statutory employer  immunity.\"   This means  that\n\nsuch  a contractor can invoke  11 L.P.R.A.    21 as a defense\n\nagainst claims by his subcontractors' injured employees.\n\n          Under the LHWCA, as  under the Puerto Rico statute,\n\nan  employer must \"secure the payment to his employees of the\n\ncompensation payable\"  under the  LHWCA, 33 U.S.C.    904(a),\n\n                             -20-\n\nand  in exchange is liable  to injured employees  only to the\n\nextent  of the workers'  compensation payments.   33 U.S.C.  \n\n905(a).    In  contrast  to the  PRWCA,  however,  the  LHWCA\n\nrequires  contractors  to   secure  compensation  for   their\n\nsubcontractor's  employees  only  if  the  subcontractors are\n                                    \n\nactually  uninsured.  33 U.S.C.    904(a).   The more limited\n\nresponsibility  of  contractors  for   their  subcontractors'\n\nemployees is mirrored by the limited immunity for contractors\n\ngranted by 33 U.S.C.   905(a):\n\n          The liability of  an employer  prescribed\n          in  section 904  of this  title shall  be\n          exclusive  and  in  place  of  all  other\n          liability   of   such  employer   to  the\n          employee,  .   .  .  except  that  if  an\n          employer  fails  to  secure   payment  of\n          compensation as required by this chapter,\n          an injured  employee .  . . may  elect to\n          claim compensation under this chapter, or\n          to  maintain  an  action  at  law  or  in\n          admiralty for damages  on account of such\n          injury or death.  . . .  For  purposes of\n          this  subsection,  a contractor  shall be\n          deemed the employer of  a subcontractor's\n          employees only if the subcontractor fails\n          to  secure the payment of compensation as\n          required by section 904 of this title.\n\nThus,  a  contractor  is  entitled  to  so-called  \"statutory\n\nemployer\"  immunity   under  section   905(a)  only   if  the\n\ncontractor is compelled by  section 904(a) to secure workers'\n\ncompensation  for the  subcontractor's employees  because the\n\nsubcontractor fails to do so and the contractor actually does\n\nsecure the payment.

Marathon Oil Co.,  755 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n428, 429-30 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\n                             -21-\n\n          Clearly,  then,  the  statutory  employer  immunity\n\nprovisions of the  LHWCA and  the PRWCA are  different.   Cf.\n                                                             \n\nGarcia v. Friesecke, 597 F.2d 284, 293 (1st Cir.) (explaining\n                   \n\ndifferences    between    Puerto    Rico   Supreme    Court's\n\ninterpretation of PRWCA, which grants immunity to contractors\n\nwho  require  subcontractor  to acquire  insurance,  and  the\n\nformer  1st Circuit  interpretation of  the PRWCA,  which did\n\nnot), cert.  denied, 444  U.S. 940  (1979).   It is far  less\n                   \n\nclear, however, that they  are in \"conflict.\"  We  think they\n\nare  not.  As we decided supra, the United States is entitled\n                              \n\nto immunity  as  an  \"employer\"  within  the  meaning  of  11\n\nL.P.R.A.   20 against a Puerto Rico negligence action brought\n\nby this  employee who  was  both insured,  and has  recovered\n\ncompensation,  under Puerto  Rico's Act.   Even  assuming the\n\nUnited  States  would  fail were  it  to  try  to invoke  the\n\nstatutory  employer immunity  created  by  section  905(a),11\n\nthis shows only that  the federal statute does not go  so far\n\nas Puerto  Rico's to bar third-party actions by employees who\n\ncome  within its  own program.   The  LHWCA does  not express\n\ndisapproval  of  a state's  affording  a  different or  wider\n\nemployer's immunity in the case of its own insureds.   \n\n                    \n\n11.  Whether the United States  would not be federally immune\n                                         \nis by  no  means  clear  on  this record.    To  qualify  for\nimmunity,  the United  States  would have  to  show that  (a)\nVigilantes failed to secure LHWCA compensation as required by\nsection 904;  and (b) the  United States  itself secured  the\npayment  of such compensation.  The facts pertaining to these\nissues were not developed below.\n\n                             -22-\n\n          Conflict  is  lacking  because,   although  section\n\n905(a)  does  not  give   the  United  States  immunity  from\n                       \n\nappellant's  suit, neither  does  it take  away the  immunity\n                                               \n\nseparately  created by  Puerto Rico's  workmen's compensation\n\nlaws.   The last  sentence of  section 905(a)  seems crucial:\n\n\"For  purposes  of this  subsection,  a  contractor shall  be\n                                   \n\ndeemed the  employer of  a subcontractor's employees  only if\n\nthe subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation\n\nas required by section 904 of this title.\" 33 U.S.C.   905(a)\n\n(emphasis added).   On its  face, section  905(a) limits  the\n\nextent of immunity for contractors only \"for purposes of this\n\nsubsection.\"  That  is, a contractor cannot  invoke the first\n\nsentence  of section 905(a)     which limits the liability of\n\nan \"employer\"  who complies with 33  U.S.C.   904(a)     as a\n\nshield  against  liability to  employees  of  a subcontractor\n\nunless   the   subcontractor   actually   fails   to   secure\n\ncompensation.  Section 905(a) does not refer  to or otherwise\n\nimplicate immunities granted by  other federal or state laws.\n\nIn this case, the United States did not invoke section 905(a)\n\nas a defense  against appellant's action.  Instead,  it found\n\nshelter  in a  Puerto Rico  statute, 11 L.P.R.A.    21.   So,\n\nwhile section 905(a) does not confer immunity upon the United\n\nStates  here,   neither   does  it   facially  prohibit   the\n\napplication of immunity created by Puerto Rico law.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          Moreover, the legislative history of section 905(a)\n\ncontains no evidence that Congress intended to preempt state-\n\nlaw rules of  statutory employer immunity when  the LHWCA and\n\nstate  acts have  concurrent jurisdiction.   Congress amended\n\nsections 4(a) and  5(a) of  the LHWCA, 33  U.S.C.     904(a),\n\n905(a),  to   legislatively  overturn  the   Supreme  Court's\n\ndecision  in Washington  Metropolitan Area  Transit Auth.  v.\n                                                         \n\nJohnson, 467 U.S. 925  (1984).

(a) Section 4(a)  is amended  to\n          read as follows:\n               \"Sec. 4. (a) Every employer shall be\n          liable  for and shall  secure the payment\n          to  his  employees  of  the  compensation\n          payable under  sections 7, 8, and  9.  In\n          the  case   of  an  employer  who   is  a\n          subcontractor, only if such subcontractor\n          fails   to   secure   the    payment   of\n          compensation  shall   the  contractor  be\n          liable for and be required  to secure the\n          payment of compensation.  A subcontractor\n          shall not  be  deemed to  have failed  to\n          secure the payment of compensation if the\n          contractor  has  provided  insurance  for\n          such compensation for the benefit  of the\n          subcontractor.\".\n               (b)  Section  5(a)  is   amended  by\n          adding  at the end  thereof the following\n          new  sentence:  \"For  purposes   of  this\n          subsection, a contractor shall  be deemed\n          the   employer   of   a   subcontractor's\n          employees only if the subcontractor fails\n\n                             -26-\n\nlegislative history,  however, of  an intent to  supplant all\n\nstate-law statutory  employer  immunity doctrines  where  the\n\nLHWCA   and  state   compensation  schemes   have  concurrent\n\njurisdiction.   See Garvin,  787  F.2d at  916-17.   Congress\n                          \n\nexpressly stated  that the amendment's purpose  was to change\n\nthe rules  governing \"immunity  under the  Longshoremen's and\n\nHarbor Workers' Compensation Act,\"  the \"immunity afforded by\n\nSection 5(a) of the Act,\"  and the definition of  \"'employer'\n\nfor purposes  of section  5(a).\"   Congress  did not  mention\n\nstate-created  immunity  or state  law  workers' compensation\n\nlaws.   Absent such evidence, we  see no reason to  find that\n\nCongress  intended   such  a  sweeping  preemption  of  state\n\nworkers' compensation  laws, a  change that  would contradict\n\nthe general  presumption that the LHWCA  \"supplements, rather\n\nthan  supplants,  state  compensation  law\"   where  the  two\n\noverlap.   Sun Ship,  447 U.S. at  720.  Because  neither the\n                   \n\ntext  nor  legislative  history  of  section  905(a)  support\n\nappellant's contention that it conflicts with Puerto Rico law\n\nin  this situation, we find no preemption and thus affirm the\n\ndistrict   court's  application   of  Puerto   Rico  workers'\n\ncompensation law without regard for the LHWCA.\n\n                    \n\n          to  secure the payment of compensation as\n          required by section 4.\".\n\nPub.

Alumax of South Carolina,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 787 F.2d  910 (4th  Cir.), cert. denied,  479 U.S.  914\n                                             \n\n(1986),  which held  that  section 905(a)  does not  conflict\n\nwith, and hence does not preempt, the statutory employer rule\n\nof  South  Carolina  workers'  compensation  law,  when  both\n\nregimes apply  concurrently and  the injured worker  brings a\n\ncommon-law negligence claim against a contractor.  The Garvin\n                                                             \n\ncourt found  that a contractor was entitled to immunity under\n\nSouth  Carolina  law and  was  not entitled  to  the immunity\n\nextended by section 905(a), as amended in 1984.\n\n          There is nothing in that amendment or its\n          legislative history, however, to indicate\n          a congressional intention to restrict the\n          application of state created  immunity of\n          contractors  in  situations in  which the\n          state  statute   traditionally  had  been\n          applied.\n               It was necessary, of course, for the\n          Congress in  the  LHWCA to  deal in  some\n          fashion  with  employer  immunity.   That\n          statute has exclusive application  in the\n          District of Columbia and to most injuries\n          suffered on  the navigable waters  of the\n          United  States.    In  those  areas,  the\n          Congress was free to determine for itself\n          under   what   circumstances  a   general\n          contractor  would  be  immune  from  tort\n          actions by employees of  a subcontractor,\n          but nothing done in the Congress suggests\n          that  it  intended  to modify  immunities\n          provided  general  contractors  by  state\n          workmen's  compensation laws,  when those\n          laws are applicable. . . . \n               The South Carolina rule  of immunity\n          of  a  contractor   in  the  position  of\n          [defendant] is different from  that under\n          the LHWCA, but  not in conflict  with it,\n          for   Congress   has  not   purported  to\n\n                             -28-\n\n          prescribe  the  immunity   rules  to   be\n          applied by states in actions brought upon\n          state law claims. \n\nId.  at 916-17.  Because  plaintiff had a  state-law cause of\n   \n\naction, the LHWCA immunity  rule did not apply and  hence did\n\nnot conflict with the  South Carolina rule.  Id.   Similarly,\n                                                \n\nthe Virginia Supreme Court held that where both the LHWCA and\n\nVirginia workers' compensation act apply to an injured worker\n\nwho brings a state-law  negligence suit against a contractor,\n\nthe Virginia statutory employer  immunity rule, which is also\n\nessentially the same  as Puerto Rico's,  is not preempted  by\n\nsection 905(a).

Appellant argues on  appeal that the court\n\nmisapplied  Puerto Rico  law, and,  in the  alternative, that\n\nfederal law preempts the  statutory employer immunity rule of\n\nPuerto Rico law.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment.\n\n                              I.\n\n          In 1988, appellant David Vega-Mena  was employed by\n\nVigilantes,  Inc. (\"Vigilantes\"), a Puerto Rican corporation,\n\nas a security guard.  Pursuant to  a contract with the United\n\nStates  of   America,  Vigilantes  provided   security  guard\n\nservices at the United  States Naval Station, Roosevelt Roads\n\nin Ceiba, Puerto Rico.   On the evening of October 13,  1988,\n\nVega-Mena was  performing his duties  as a security  guard at\n\nthe Roosevelt Roads naval station when he fell into a tank of\n\nwaste diesel fuel and sustained serious injuries.  \n\n          Vigilantes was an insured employer pursuant to  the\n\nPuerto Rico Workmen's Compensation Act (\"PRWCA\"), 11 L.P.R.A.\n\n                             -3-\n\n   1 et seq., and  Vega-Mena applied for,  and collected, all\n            \n\nthe  benefits available to  him as an  employee of Vigilantes\n\nunder the PRWCA.  Thereafter,  in October 1990, Vega-Mena and\n\nother  plaintiffs brought  this  civil action  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\nthe United States, Vigilantes,  and certain other defendants.\n\nPlaintiffs  alleged  that defendants'  negligence  had caused\n\nVega-Mena's  injuries.   For  reasons  not  relevant to  this\n\nappeal, the complaint was amended in April 1991 to name Vega-\n\nMena  as  the sole  plaintiff and  Vigilantes and  the United\n\nStates as the only defendants.\n\n          Both  the original  and amended  complaints alleged\n\nthat  the  district court  had  jurisdiction  pursuant to  28\n\nU.S.C.    1346, the  jurisdictional provision of  the Federal\n\nTort Claims Act.  The complaints also referred to 28 U.S.C.  \n\n2671, which  defines terms  used in  the Federal Tort  Claims\n\nAct.  The only cause of action alleged was for \"negligence.\"\n\n          The  district court  dismissed  the claims  against\n\nVigilantes  on jurisdictional  grounds.   Vega-Mena  does not\n\nappeal from that  ruling.   In July 1991,  the United  States\n\nmoved for summary  judgment on  the claims against  it.   The\n\ngovernment argued that the Puerto Rico Workmen's Compensation\n\nAct entitled  it  to \"statutory  employer\"  immunity  against\n\nappellant's action.  Vega-Mena replied that the United States\n\ndid not meet  the requirements of  Puerto Rico for  statutory\n\n                             -4-\n\nemployer  status.   In  the  alternative,  he contended,  the\n\nLongshore and  Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,  33 U.S.C.  \n\n901 et seq.     which applied to his case,  appellant argued,\n           \n\nby  force  of the  Defense  Bases Act,  42  U.S.C.    1651   \n\npreempted Puerto Rico's statutory employer rule, disentitling\n\nthe United States to statutory employer immunity.  \n\n          The district court granted  summary judgment to the\n\nUnited States, finding no genuine issue of  material fact and\n\nholding  that  the  PRWCA  provided the  United  States  with\n\nstatutory   employer  immunity.      The  court   noted  that\n\nplaintiff's original and amended complaints made no reference\n\nto the  Longshoreman and Harbor Workers'  Compensation Act or\n\nthe  Defense Bases  Act, but stated  that \"the  outcome would\n\nhave been the same\" even if  he had \"brought the claim\" under\n\nthose acts.   Appellant  Vega-Mena appeals from  the district\n\ncourt's final order to the extent it granted summary judgment\n\nfor appellee, the United States.\n\n                             II.\n\nA.  Puerto Rico Statutory Employer Doctrine\n                                           \n\n          Vega-Mena   contends   that   the  district   court\n\nmisconstrued Puerto Rican law  in determining that the United\n\nStates  was  immune  as  a  \"statutory  employer\"  from  tort\n\nliability for appellant's injuries. \n\n          Under  the workers'  compensation scheme  in Puerto\n\nRico, when an employee suffers an injury, illness, disability\n\n                             -5-\n\nor death  as a result  of \"any  act or  function inherent  in\n\n[his]  work,\" and his  employer is insured  according to law,\n\nthe  employee's right  to compensation  from the  employer is\n\nlimited to  the statutory  compensation  offered through  the\n\nState Insurance Fund.  11 L.P.R.A.   2, 21; Santiago Hodge v.\n                                                          \n\nParke Davis &amp; Co., 126 D.P.R. 1 (1990)  (hereinafter Santiago\n                                                             \n\nHodge P.R.)

The United  States and  Vigilantes clearly  had a\n\nprincipal contractor-subcontractor relationship.  Under their\n\nwritten agreement, Vigilantes was obligated to provide  guard\n\nservices to the United States at specified locations for  the\n\nterm  of the  contract.    Vigilantes'  employees,  including\n\nappellant,   worked  as   guards  at   United  States   naval\n\nfacilities,   and  appellant  sustained  his  injuries  while\n\nworking as a Vigilantes  guard on patrol at such  a facility.\n\nEven  more  to the  point,  the  United States  contractually\n\nrequired  Vigilantes  to obtain  state  workers' compensation\n\ninsurance  for the security guards as required by Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.3  It was under  this insurance that appellant, following\n\n                    \n\n3.   The relevant provision in the contract reads:\n\n     H.18  INSURANCE\n                    \n          Within fifteen  (15) days  after the award  of this\n     contract, the Contractor  [Vigilantes] shall furnish the\n     OIC [a United  States government agency] certificate  of\n     insurance as evidence of  the existence of the following\n     insurance coverage in amounts  not less than the amounts\n     specified below in accordance with the \"INSURANCE - WORK\n     ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION\" clause, Section I.\n\n                           COVERAGE\nCOVERAGE       PER PERSON     PER ACCIDENT    PROPERTY\n\nComprehensive  $300,000       $1,000,000      $100,000 \nGeneral \nLiability\n\nAutomobile     $300,000       $1,000,000      $100,000\nLiability\n\nWorker's       AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW\nCompensation\n\n(Other as required by State Law)\n\n                             -10-\n\ninjury,  brought  his claim  for compensation  and recovered.\n\nGiven  the terms of the  contract between the  parties, it is\n\nclear that  under Puerto Rico  law the requisite  legal nexus\n\nexisted between  the United  States and Vigilantes,  and thus\n\nthat the  United States  was properly  found by  the district\n\ncourt to be immune as appellant's statutory employer.\n\n          Appellant  makes only  one attack  on the  district\n\ncourt's application of Puerto Rico law to  the facts, arguing\n\nthat the  contract between  Vigilantes and the  United States\n\nwas  essentially  a  \"contract  for hire\"  recognized  by  31\n\nL.P.R.A.    4111, and that this type of contract creates only\n\na   relationship   of   employer-employee,  not   contractor-\n\nsubcontractor.4      However,   section  4111  only  entitles\n\n                    \n\nThe Certificate  of Insurance  shall provide for  thirty days\nwritten notice to the  OIC by the insurance company  prior to\ncancellation or  material change  in policy coverage.   Other\nrequirements   and   information   are   contained   in   the\naforementioned \"Insurance\" clause.\n\n4.  31 L.P.R.A.   4111 provides:\n\n               Period  of  contract  for  services;\n                                                   \n          remuneration    The services  of servants\n                      \n          and  laborers may  be  contracted  for  a\n          fixed period  of time, or without a fixed\n          period.

It  does not in any way  alter or void the\n\nterms of the  written contract between the  United States and\n\nVigilantes,   which   clearly   establishes   a   contractor-\n\nsubcontractor relationship sufficient  to entitle the  United\n\nStates  to  statutory  employer  immunity under  Puerto  Rico\n\nlaw.5\n\n          We  find  no  error,  therefore,  in  the  district\n\ncourt's  holding  that, under  Puerto  Rico  law, the  United\n\nStates  is immune  as  a \"statutory  employer\"  from suit  by\n\nappellant under Puerto Rican tort law.\n\nB.

The  district court applied\n\nPuerto  Rico law  because  appellant's  complaint stated  its\n\n                    \n\n5.  Appellant  argues  that  the  United  States  waived  the\naffirmative defense of statutory employer immunity by failing\nto raise  it in its answer  to the complaint.

The  complaint   expressly  invoked   the\n\njurisdictional  provision  of the  FTCA,  28  U.S.C.    1346,\n\nwithout  mentioning any other federal or state law.  Under 28\n\nU.S.C.    1346(b), the  district court has  jurisdiction over\n\nactions against the United States for money damages:\n\n          for   injury  or  loss  of  property,  or\n          personal  injury or  death caused  by the\n          negligent or wrongful act or  omission of\n          any  employee  of  the  Government  while\n          acting within the scope of his  office or\n          employment, under circumstances where the\n                                                   \n          United States, if a private person, would\n                                                   \n          be liable  to the claimant  in accordance\n                                                   \n          with the  law of the place  where the act\n                                                   \n          or omission occurred.\n                              \n\n28 U.S.C.   1346(b) (emphasis supplied).   The district court\n\napplied  the law  of  the place  where  the act  or  omission\n\noccurred, Puerto Rico,  and reached the  conclusion, affirmed\n\nsupra, that  under  Puerto Rico  law  the United  States  was\n     \n\nimmune as a statutory employer.\n\n          Appellant concedes  that he sued the  United States\n\npursuant to the  FTCA and that the  FTCA mandates application\n\nof  local law.   However,  he argues:  (1) the  Longshore and\n\nHarbor Workers'  Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\"), 33  U.S.C.   901\n\net  seq., also  applies  to this  case,  as extended  by  the\n        \n\nDefense Bases Act,  42 U.S.C.   1651  et seq.; (2) the  LHWCA\n                                             \n\nexclusive liability provision, 33 U.S.C.   905(a), entitles a\n\ncontractor  to  statutory  employer   immunity  only  if  the\n\nsubcontractor actually fails to secure payment to the injured\n\n                             -13-\n\nworker; (3) the subcontractor  here, Vigilantes, did not fail\n\nto secure compensation payments for appellant; (4) therefore,\n\nunder  the  LHWCA,  the  United States  is  not  immune  from\n\nappellant's  suit for  damages; and, (5)  since the  LHWCA is\n\nfederal law, it preempts the inconsistent PRWCA rule and thus\n\nshould have been applied by the district court.\n\n          Appellant's  preemption argument  presupposes that,\n\nbecause his accident occurred on a naval base in Puerto Rico,\n\nthe Defense Bases  Act, 42  U.S.C.   1651  et seq.,  applies,\n                                                  \n\nmandating application  of the Longshore  and Harbor  Workers'\n\nCompensation  Act.

It can be argued that, for\n\n                    \n\n6.  42 U.S.C.   1651 provides that:\n\n          (a)  Except  as   herein  modified,   the\n          provisions  of   the  Longshoremen's  and\n          Harbor    Workers'   Compensation    Act,\n          approved March 4,  1927 (44 Stat.  1424),\n          as amended, shall apply in respect to the\n          injury  or death of  any employee engaged\n          in any employment   \n               (2) upon any  lands occupied or used\n          by  the  United  States  for  military or\n          naval  purposes  in   any  Territory   or\n          possession outside the continental United\n          States (including the United States Naval\n          Operating Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and\n          the Canal Zone); \n          . . . .\n\nSection 1651  also makes the LHWCA applicable to employees of\ncontractors  and  subcontractors  on  certain   public  works\nprojects outside the continental United States.   42 U.S.C.  \n1651(a)(3)-(a)(5).      42   U.S.C.      1651(b)(4)   defines\n\"continental United  States\" as \"the States  and the District\nof Columbia.\"\n\n                             -14-\n\nthe narrow and specialized purposes of the Defense Bases Act,\n\nPuerto Rico  is not  a \"Territory or  possession outside  the\n\ncontinental United States\" as  those terms are there intended\n\nto  be  understood.7    We  need  not,  however,  decide this\n\n                    \n\n7.  Appellant asserts without  analysis that bases in  Puerto\nRico  \"obviously\" fall  within the  definition of  \"any lands\noccupied or used by  the United States for military  or naval\npurposes  in   any  Territory   or  possession   outside  the\ncontinental  United States.\"  The  question is not so simple,\nhowever.    The Defense  Bases Act  applies  to bases  in any\n\"territory,\"  but that term is not defined by the Act nor has\nappellant cited  any cases  interpreting it in  that context.\nAs we have noted before:\n\n          The  term \"territory\"  does  not  have  a\n          fixed and technical  meaning accorded  to\n          it in all circumstances, and  thus Puerto\n          Rico may be  found to be  included within\n          one   act   whose  coverage   extends  to\n          territories  of  the  United  States  and\n          excluded  from  another.

Exclusiveness of remedy   When an\n                                         \n          employer insures his workmen or employees\n          in  accordance  with  this  chapter,  the\n          right   herein   established  to   obtain\n          compensation  shall  be  the only  remedy\n          against the employer, even in those cases\n          where maximum  compensations and benefits\n          have    been   granted    in   accordance\n          thereof; . . . . \n\nIn shorthand,  11 L.P.R.A.   21  entitles complying employers\n\nto \"immunity\" from damages actions  by injured employees.  In\n\naddition,  a   contractor  is  secondarily  liable   for  the\n\ninsurance premium payments for its  subcontractor's employees\n\nwhen the subcontractor is not properly insured.   11 L.P.R.A.\n\n  20.   As interpreted by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, this\n\nmutual obligation  entitles contractors to  the same immunity\n\nenjoyed by employers and so such contractors are deemed to be\n\n\"employers\" for the purposes  of 11 L.P.R.A.   21.  They have\n\nso-called  \"statutory employer  immunity.\"   This means  that\n\nsuch  a contractor can invoke  11 L.P.R.A.    21 as a defense\n\nagainst claims by his subcontractors' injured employees.\n\n          Under the LHWCA, as  under the Puerto Rico statute,\n\nan  employer must \"secure the payment to his employees of the\n\ncompensation payable\"  under the  LHWCA, 33 U.S.C.    904(a),\n\n                             -20-\n\nand  in exchange is liable  to injured employees  only to the\n\nextent  of the workers'  compensation payments.   33 U.S.C.  \n\n905(a).    In  contrast  to the  PRWCA,  however,  the  LHWCA\n\nrequires  contractors  to   secure  compensation  for   their\n\nsubcontractor's  employees  only  if  the  subcontractors are\n                                    \n\nactually  uninsured.  33 U.S.C.    904(a).   The more limited\n\nresponsibility  of  contractors  for   their  subcontractors'\n\nemployees is mirrored by the limited immunity for contractors\n\ngranted by 33 U.S.C.   905(a):\n\n          The liability of  an employer  prescribed\n          in  section 904  of this  title shall  be\n          exclusive  and  in  place  of  all  other\n          liability   of   such  employer   to  the\n          employee,  .   .  .  except  that  if  an\n          employer  fails  to  secure   payment  of\n          compensation as required by this chapter,\n          an injured  employee .  . . may  elect to\n          claim compensation under this chapter, or\n          to  maintain  an  action  at  law  or  in\n          admiralty for damages  on account of such\n          injury or death.  . . .  For  purposes of\n          this  subsection,  a contractor  shall be\n          deemed the employer of  a subcontractor's\n          employees only if the subcontractor fails\n          to  secure the payment of compensation as\n          required by section 904 of this title.\n\nThus,  a  contractor  is  entitled  to  so-called  \"statutory\n\nemployer\"  immunity   under  section   905(a)  only   if  the\n\ncontractor is compelled by  section 904(a) to secure workers'\n\ncompensation  for the  subcontractor's employees  because the\n\nsubcontractor fails to do so and the contractor actually does\n\nsecure the payment.

It is far  less\n                   \n\nclear, however, that they  are in \"conflict.\"  We  think they\n\nare  not.  As we decided supra, the United States is entitled\n                              \n\nto immunity  as  an  \"employer\"  within  the  meaning  of  11\n\nL.P.R.A.   20 against a Puerto Rico negligence action brought\n\nby this  employee who  was  both insured,  and has  recovered\n\ncompensation,  under Puerto  Rico's Act.   Even  assuming the\n\nUnited  States  would  fail were  it  to  try  to invoke  the\n\nstatutory  employer immunity  created  by  section  905(a),11\n\nthis shows only that  the federal statute does not go  so far\n\nas Puerto  Rico's to bar third-party actions by employees who\n\ncome  within its  own program.   The  LHWCA does  not express\n\ndisapproval  of  a state's  affording  a  different or  wider\n\nemployer's immunity in the case of its own insureds.   \n\n                    \n\n11.  Whether the United States  would not be federally immune\n                                         \nis by  no  means  clear  on  this record.    To  qualify  for\nimmunity,  the United  States  would have  to  show that  (a)\nVigilantes failed to secure LHWCA compensation as required by\nsection 904;  and (b) the  United States  itself secured  the\npayment  of such compensation.  The facts pertaining to these\nissues were not developed below.\n\n                             -22-\n\n          Conflict  is  lacking  because,   although  section\n\n905(a)  does  not  give   the  United  States  immunity  from\n                       \n\nappellant's  suit, neither  does  it take  away the  immunity\n                                               \n\nseparately  created by  Puerto Rico's  workmen's compensation\n\nlaws.   The last  sentence of  section 905(a)  seems crucial:\n\n\"For  purposes  of this  subsection,  a  contractor shall  be\n                                   \n\ndeemed the  employer of  a subcontractor's employees  only if\n\nthe subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation\n\nas required by section 904 of this title.\" 33 U.S.C.   905(a)\n\n(emphasis added).   On its  face, section  905(a) limits  the\n\nextent of immunity for contractors only \"for purposes of this\n\nsubsection.\"  That  is, a contractor cannot  invoke the first\n\nsentence  of section 905(a)     which limits the liability of\n\nan \"employer\"  who complies with 33  U.S.C.   904(a)     as a\n\nshield  against  liability to  employees  of  a subcontractor\n\nunless   the   subcontractor   actually   fails   to   secure\n\ncompensation.  Section 905(a) does not refer  to or otherwise\n\nimplicate immunities granted by  other federal or state laws.\n\nIn this case, the United States did not invoke section 905(a)\n\nas a defense  against appellant's action.  Instead,  it found\n\nshelter  in a  Puerto Rico  statute, 11 L.P.R.A.    21.   So,\n\nwhile section 905(a) does not confer immunity upon the United\n\nStates  here,   neither   does  it   facially  prohibit   the\n\napplication of immunity created by Puerto Rico law.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          Moreover, the legislative history of section 905(a)\n\ncontains no evidence that Congress intended to preempt state-\n\nlaw rules of  statutory employer immunity when  the LHWCA and\n\nstate  acts have  concurrent jurisdiction.

A subcontractor\n          shall not  be  deemed to  have failed  to\n          secure the payment of compensation if the\n          contractor  has  provided  insurance  for\n          such compensation for the benefit  of the\n          subcontractor.\".\n               (b)  Section  5(a)  is   amended  by\n          adding  at the end  thereof the following\n          new  sentence:  \"For  purposes   of  this\n          subsection, a contractor shall  be deemed\n          the   employer   of   a   subcontractor's\n          employees only if the subcontractor fails\n\n                             -26-\n\nlegislative history,  however, of  an intent to  supplant all\n\nstate-law statutory  employer  immunity doctrines  where  the\n\nLHWCA   and  state   compensation  schemes   have  concurrent\n\njurisdiction.   See Garvin,  787  F.2d at  916-17.   Congress\n                          \n\nexpressly stated  that the amendment's purpose  was to change\n\nthe rules  governing \"immunity  under the  Longshoremen's and\n\nHarbor Workers' Compensation Act,\"  the \"immunity afforded by\n\nSection 5(a) of the Act,\"  and the definition of  \"'employer'\n\nfor purposes  of section  5(a).\"   Congress  did not  mention\n\nstate-created  immunity  or state  law  workers' compensation\n\nlaws.   Absent such evidence, we  see no reason to  find that\n\nCongress  intended   such  a  sweeping  preemption  of  state\n\nworkers' compensation  laws, a  change that  would contradict\n\nthe general  presumption that the LHWCA  \"supplements, rather\n\nthan  supplants,  state  compensation  law\"   where  the  two\n\noverlap.

The Garvin\n                                                             \n\ncourt found  that a contractor was entitled to immunity under\n\nSouth  Carolina  law and  was  not entitled  to  the immunity\n\nextended by section 905(a), as amended in 1984.\n\n          There is nothing in that amendment or its\n          legislative history, however, to indicate\n          a congressional intention to restrict the\n          application of state created  immunity of\n          contractors  in  situations in  which the\n          state  statute   traditionally  had  been\n          applied.\n               It was necessary, of course, for the\n          Congress in  the  LHWCA to  deal in  some\n          fashion  with  employer  immunity.   That\n          statute has exclusive application  in the\n          District of Columbia and to most injuries\n          suffered on  the navigable waters  of the\n          United  States.    In  those  areas,  the\n          Congress was free to determine for itself\n          under   what   circumstances  a   general\n          contractor  would  be  immune  from  tort\n          actions by employees of  a subcontractor,\n          but nothing done in the Congress suggests\n          that  it  intended  to modify  immunities\n          provided  general  contractors  by  state\n          workmen's  compensation laws,  when those\n          laws are applicable. . . . \n               The South Carolina rule  of immunity\n          of  a  contractor   in  the  position  of\n          [defendant] is different from  that under\n          the LHWCA, but  not in conflict  with it,\n          for   Congress   has  not   purported  to\n\n                             -28-\n\n          prescribe  the  immunity   rules  to   be\n          applied by states in actions brought upon\n          state law claims. \n\nId.  at 916-17.  Because  plaintiff had a  state-law cause of\n   \n\naction, the LHWCA immunity  rule did not apply and  hence did\n\nnot conflict with the  South Carolina rule.  Id.   Similarly,\n                                                \n\nthe Virginia Supreme Court held that where both the LHWCA and\n\nVirginia workers' compensation act apply to an injured worker\n\nwho brings a state-law  negligence suit against a contractor,\n\nthe Virginia statutory employer  immunity rule, which is also\n\nessentially the same  as Puerto Rico's,  is not preempted  by\n\nsection 905(a).
