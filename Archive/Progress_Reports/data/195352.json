Prawer &amp; Company, Gilbert\n\nPrawer, and Harvey Prawer (collectively \"Prawer\") as relators\n\nunder  the  False Claims  Act (\"FCA\"),  31  U.S.C.    3729 et\n                                                             \n\nseq.1   Plaintiffs  primarily2 contend  that the  court erred\n    \n\nin  concluding  that 31  U.S.C.     3730(e)(3),3 a  provision\n\nenacted  as  part  of the  1986  amendments  to  the qui  tam\n                                                             \n\nprovisions of the FCA, bars their claim.  The issue is one of\n\nfirst  impression, as no other  court has as  yet been called\n\nupon to  interpret the  reach and meaning  of this  ambiguous\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because  of  the  length   of  the  statutory  provisions\nrelevant to this appeal, we have attached them in an appendix\nto our opinion.\n\n2.  Employing  an extremely  literal reading  of 31  U.S.C.  \n3730(b)(1) (an action brought under the FCA \"may be dismissed\nonly  if the  court  and the  Attorney  General give  written\nconsent to the dismissal  and their reasons for consenting\"),\nplaintiffs also argue that the court erred in proceeding  sua\n                                                             \nsponte and dismissing this action without the approval of the\n      \nAttorney General.   Because, as  will be discussed  infra, we\n                                                         \nbelieve the court erred  in determining that this  action was\njurisdictionally  barred, we need not and  do not address the\nmerits  of this somewhat dubious assertion.  See Fed. R. Civ.\n                                                \nP.  12(h)(3)  (\"Whenever  it  appears by  suggestion  of  the\nparties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the\n                    \nsubject  matter,  the  court   shall  dismiss  the  action.\")\n                                    \n(emphasis added).\n\n3.  Section 3730(e)(3)  states:   \"In no  event may  a person\nbring [a qui tam  action] which is based upon  allegations or\n                \ntransactions  which are  the subject  of a  civil suit  or an\nadministrative   money  penalty   proceeding  in   which  the\ngovernment is already a party.\"\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nprovision.    After careful  consideration  of  the arguments\n\npresented, we reverse.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\nA.  Relevant Factual and Procedural History\n                                           \n\n          The  relevant facts  and allegations,  recounted in\n\nthe  light most favorable to plaintiffs, are as follows.4  In\n\nJanuary 1991,  the Maine  National Bank (\"MNB\")  was declared\n\ninsolvent  and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation\n\n(\"FDIC\")  was appointed its receiver.  The New Maine National\n\nBank (\"NMNB\") was established as  a bridge bank through which\n\nthe FDIC would conduct certain MNB-related affairs.\n\n          On or about July 12, 1991, the NMNB closed, and the\n\nFDIC sold virtually all of its assets to Fleet Bank  of Maine\n\n(\"Fleet\").  The contract by which this transfer of assets was\n\neffectuated is  known as  the \"Assistance Agreement.\"   Inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, the  Assistance Agreement  provided that Fleet  had the\n    \n\nright to \"put,\"  or cause  the FDIC to  repurchase, any  NMNB\n\nloans  acquired by  it pursuant  to the  Assistance Agreement\n\n                    \n\n4.  A few of the following  facts and allegations appear only\nin  plaintiffs' brief.  Because  they help shed  light on the\nconvoluted  factual underpinnings of this litigation and have\nno effect on  our resolution  of the question  before us,  we\nhave  included   them  in   our  recitation  of   the  case's\nbackground.   Our  inclusion of  these facts  and allegations\nshould not, however, be construed either as an endorsement of\ntheir  veracity  or as  an  indication  that  they are  well-\npleaded.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n(provided  that said  loans  did not  fall  into any  one  of\n\nseveral  exceptional categories  described in  the Assistance\n\nAgreement).  Included among  the transferred assets were five\n\npromissory notes, totalling approximately $1.1 million, given\n\nby  Prawer to  the NMNB.   The  notes represented  the amount\n\nPrawer had drawn against a $2 million line of credit extended\n\nto it by NMNB.\n\n          On  July  15,  1991,  Prawer  entered  into  a  new\n\nagreement with Fleet for  an unsecured line of credit  (known\n\nas the \"Fleet Credit Facility\") which permitted it to draw up\n\nto $2  million  by  executing  and/or  renewing  consecutive,\n\nunsecured 90-day term notes on  a note-by-note basis.  Prawer\n\nutilized  this new line of credit from Fleet to satisfy fully\n\nits  obligations  under each  of  the  five outstanding  NMNB\n\nnotes.  By May 5, 1992, Prawer had drawn $1.6 million against\n\nits  $2  million  line  of  credit  under  the  Fleet  Credit\n\nFacility.  These borrowings were evidenced by seven unsecured\n\n90-day term notes.\n\n          Meanwhile, on April 30, 1992, Prawer sold virtually\n\nall  of its  then-existing assets  to C&amp;S  Wholesale Grocers,\n\nInc. (\"C&amp;S\").  Gilbert  Prawer informed Fleet of the  sale on\n\nMay 1,  1992.   On May  6, 1992,  pursuant to  the Assistance\n\nAgreement, Fleet put  certain Prawer notes back  to the FDIC.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nThe parties hotly contest, however, whether  any of the notes\n\nwere \"putable\" under the terms of the Assistance Agreement.5\n\n          1.  The Collection Case\n\n          Subsequently, in November  1992, the FDIC commenced\n\nan action  against Prawer,  C&amp;S, and  a number of  individual\n\ndefendants  to collect upon the notes put back to it pursuant\n\nto the  Assistance Agreement.   The complaint in  that action\n\nnot only sought  enforcement of the  notes, but also  alleged\n\nthat  the  April 30,  1992, sale  of  Prawer's assets  to C&amp;S\n\nconstituted a fraudulent conveyance and violated Maine's Bulk\n\nSale Act.  More specifically, the FDIC contended that  Prawer\n\nhad become  insolvent, and  had peddled  its assets  for less\n\nthan  full value  in order  to satisfy  its debts  to certain\n\ncreditors.  Accordingly, the complaint sought  damages beyond\n\nthe amount allegedly outstanding on the notes.\n\n          Prawer  responded to  this  complaint with  several\n\naffirmative defenses  and counterclaims, as well  as filing a\n\nthird-party complaint  against  Fleet and  Recoll  Management\n\nCorporation  (\"Recoll\"),   a  Fleet  subsidiary   which  had,\n\npursuant  to  an agreement  with  the FDIC,  been  seeking to\n\n                    \n\n5.  It  has been and is plaintiffs' position that none of the\n                                                      \nnotes   were  properly  putable;  defendants  apparently  now\nconcede  that some  of  the notes  were  not putable  because\n                  \nplaintiffs' obligations thereunder had been  fully satisfied,\nbut argue that certain other notes were, in fact, putable.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ncollect upon  the notes which were  put back to the  FDIC.  A\n\nvariety   of   charges   were   made   in   these   defenses,\n\ncounterclaims,  and third-party  claims;  among these  was an\n\nassertion  that  the  notes  were  not  putable  to  the FDIC\n\npursuant to the Assistance Agreement.  But see infra note 6.\n                                                    \n\n          At  oral argument,  the  parties represented  that,\n\nsince the filing ofthis case, the Collection casehas settled.\n\n          2.  The Qui Tam Case\n                         \n\n          On June 21, 1993,  plaintiffs filed the instant qui\n                                                             \n\ntam action.   In  their complaint, plaintiffs  contended that\n   \n\nthe  named defendants --  Fleet, Recoll, Verrill  &amp; Dana (the\n\nlaw firm that served  as legal counsel to Fleet,  Recoll, and\n\nthe FDIC at all  times relevant to this matter),  P. Benjamin\n\nZuckerman  and Anne  M. Dufour  (the Verrill  &amp; Dana  lawyers\n\ninvolved in  this matter), and  Amy Bierbaum  (an FDIC  staff\n\nattorney) -- \"created and  used, or caused to be  created and\n\nused, false  records and  statements designed to  defraud the\n\nGovernment  into paying Fleet approximately $1.6 million\" for\n\nthe Prawer notes pursuant  to the put-back provisions  of the\n\nAssistance Agreement.\n\n          Nine  days later,  on June  30, 1993,  the district\n\ncourt  sua sponte  dismissed  plaintiffs' complaint.   In  so\n                 \n\ndoing,  the court relied upon   3730(e)(3), see supra note 3,\n                                                     \n\nfinding  that  (1)  the  allegations  made  and  transactions\n\nimplicated in plaintiffs' complaint already were at issue (as\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ndefenses) in  the Collection case; and  (2) the \"government,\"\n\nin the person of  the FDIC, was a party to  that action.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States ex rel. S. Prawer &amp; Co. v. Fleet Bank of Maine,\n                                                            \n\n825 F. Supp. 339 (D. Me. 1993).\n\n          Plaintiffs moved  the court  to reconsider its  sua\n                                                             \n\nsponte order of dismissal, arguing, inter alia, that  (1) the\n                                              \n\n\"government,\"  for purposes of    3730(e)(3), was not a party\n\nto the Collection case;  and (2) the qui  tam action was  not\n                                             \n\n\"based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject\n\nof\" the Collection  case.  In  a comprehensive memorandum  of\n\ndecision, the court rejected both of these arguments (as well\n\nas  all other arguments made  in plaintiffs' motion).   In so\n\ndoing, however, the court  receded slightly from its original\n\nholding  on the  question of  whether there  was an  identity\n\nbetween  the  allegations and  transactions  which  were \"the\n\nsubject  of\" the Collection case and those that served as the\n\nbasis for the qui tam action.  Instead, the court found:\n                     \n\n               To  the  extent that  defenses based\n          upon  the  allegations  of  the  qui  tam\n                                                   \n          complaint  are not pleaded in the related\n          civil action, that is entirely the result\n          of the conscious decision of  counsel for\n          the  defendants   there  (and  Plaintiffs\n          here) to abjure  their pleading.  Clearly\n          the  factual  predicate  for   the  false\n          claims alleged in the qui tam action form\n                                       \n          the   basis   for  assertion   of  viable\n          defenses  to the claims  made against the\n          defendant  S. Prawer  &amp;  Company  on  the\n          notes in  the related civil  action.   An\n          effective defense to  those claims  would\n          require  that  those defenses  be pleaded\n          there if counsel, in good faith,  believe\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          the facts put  forth here.  . .  .   This\n          Court    believes    that   the    proper\n          construction  of [   3730(e)(3)] requires\n          that  it  be   read  broadly  enough   to\n          encompass   not   only  allegations   and\n          transactions actually put in issue by the\n          litigants in the  related civil suit  but\n          any  allegations   or  transactions  that\n          could  legitimately  be  made  a  subject\n          (e.g., [sic]  be  put in  issue) of  that\n               \n          suit  in   the  regular  course   of  its\n          development.\n\nUnited States ex rel. S. Prawer &amp; Co. v. Fleet Bank of Maine,\n                                                            \n\nCiv. No. 93-165-P-C,  slip op. at 3-4 (D. Me.  July 12, 1993)\n\n(footnote  omitted).6      Accordingly,  the   court   denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion.  Id. at 9.\n                        \n\nB.  The Statutory Framework\n                           \n\n          Because  our resolution of  the issue  presented in\n\nthis appeal  necessarily is informed by  Congress's intent in\n\nenacting the 1986 amendments to the FCA's qui tam provisions,\n                                                 \n\na  brief historical overview of the statute is in order.

The Jurisdictional Question\n                               \n\n          As they did  before the district  court, plaintiffs\n\nhere  argue that  (1) the  FDIC  is not,  for  purposes of   \n\n3730(e)(3), \"the  government\"; and (2) the  instant action is\n\nnot  \"based upon  allegations or  transactions which  are the\n\nsubject of\" the Collection  case.  See supra note 3.  Because\n                                            \n\nwe  believe  that  the second  of  these  two  contentions is\n\nultimately  persuasive,  and  that  the statutory  bar  of   \n\n3730(e)(3)  therefore does not  apply, we turn  our sights to\n\nthis provision of the statute.\n\n          We start  by noting the obvious:   the breadth with\n\nwhich we should read  the phrase \"allegations or transactions\n\nwhich  are  the  subject of  a  civil  suit\"  is not  readily\n                           \n\napparent from the  text of the statute.  Defendants' argument\n\nthat,  because plaintiffs  denied the  legitimacy of  the put\n\ntransaction (alleging fraud) in the Collection case, there is\n\nan identity  between the  allegations and transactions  which\n\nwere  at least  a  \"subject  of\"  that  case  and  the  fraud\n\nallegations which serve as \"the basis\" of this case certainly\n\nstrikes us as being anchored upon a plausible construction of\n\nthe  phrase  \"the  subject of\"  in     3730(e)(3).   So  too,\n\nhowever, does  plaintiffs' argument  that, when viewed  at an\n\nappropriate   level  of  specificity,  the  transactions  and\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nallegations which  are \"the  subject of\" the  Collection case\n                           \n\nshould and  must be seen only  as Prawer's (1)  making of the\n\nsued-upon  notes, and  (2) alleged  failure to  satisfy them.\n\nTherefore, we regard the statute as ambiguous.\n\n          When  faced  with  a  facially  ambiguous statutory\n\nprovision, we look to the statute as  a whole and the history\n\nof  its enactment  in  order to  glean congressional  intent.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Concrete Pipe  &amp;  Prods.,  Inc. v.

Here,  we  think  the rather  easily-discerned\n\npurposes underlying the 1986  amendments militate strongly in\n\nfavor of plaintiffs' reading of the phrase.\n\n          As Judge  Wald observed in the  Quinn decision (and\n                                               \n\nas we have noted  above, see supra at 14-15),  \"[t]he history\n                                  \n\nof  the   FCA  qui  tam   provisions  demonstrates   repeated\n                       \n\ncongressional efforts to walk a fine line between encouraging\n\nwhistle-blowing  and  discouraging  opportunistic  behavior,\"\n\nQuinn, 14 F.3d at 651.  Clearly, the 1986 amendments, insofar\n     \n\nas they were responding  to a regime in which  the preclusion\n\nof opportunistic litigation was  too heavily weighted, had as\n\nperhaps  their central purpose  an expansion of opportunities\n\nand incentives  for private citizens with  knowledge of fraud\n\nagainst the government to come forward with that information.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nSee S.

It seems\n\nclear  that  the answer  to  this  question is  circumstances\n\ninvolving \"parasitic\" qui tam actions which are not otherwise\n                             \n\nbarred  by    3730(e).   Cf.,  e.g., Quinn,  14  F.3d at  651\n                                          \n\n(interpreting   the  1986   amendments   as  \"still   another\n\ncongressional effort to reconcile avoidance of parasitism and\n\nencouragement  of  legitimate citizen  enforcement actions\").\n\nThus, when  it is not clear  whether or not a  qui tam action\n                                                      \n\nshould be  barred by  the ambiguous provision  precluding the\n\naction if it is \"based upon transactions or allegations which\n\nare the subject of\"  another suit or proceeding in  which the\n\ngovernment  is a  party, we  think that  a court  should look\n\nfirst  to whether  the two  cases can  properly be  viewed as\n\nhaving  the qualities  of a  host/parasite relationship.   In\n\nanswering  this question, we think it would be useful for the\n\ncourt  to be guided by the definition of the word \"parasite,\"\n\nand  ask whether  the  qui tam  case  is receiving  \"support,\n                              \n\nadvantage,  or the like\" from  the \"host\" case  (in which the\n\ngovernment is a  party) \"without giving any useful  or proper\n\nreturn\" to the  government (or at least  having the potential\n\nto  do so).    See Random  House  Dictionary of  the  English\n                                                             \n\nLanguage  1409 (2d ed. unabridged 1987).  If this question is\n        \n\nanswered in the affirmative,  the court may properly conclude\n\nthat there is an identity between  \"the basis\" of the qui tam\n                                                             \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\naction  and \"the subject of\" the other suit or proceeding; if\n\nthis  question  is  answered   in  the  negative,  the  court\n\nsimilarly may gather that such an identity is lacking.\n\n          Of  course, because Congress's intuition as to what\n\nconstitutes  \"potential useful  and  proper  return\"  to  the\n\ngovernment  clearly changed  with the  enactment of  the 1986\n\namendments,  our endorsement  of this  inquiry would  beg the\n\nquestion  entirely without  two  further points.   While  the\n\nquestion of  what now constitutes potential  useful or proper\n\nreturn to the government  will not always be  easily answered\n\nand must necessarily be addressed on a case-by-case basis, we\n\nbelieve it important to  note that one of the  most important\n\nperceptions   precipitating  the  1986  amendments  was  that\n\nactions which had the potential of providing such return were\n\nbeing precluded  by the  then-existing statutory regime.   In\n\nlight of  this, we  feel courts  should proceed with  caution\n\nbefore  applying  the  statutory   bar  of     3730(e)(3)  in\n\nambiguous circumstances.\n\n          On the other hand, we think it clear that a qui tam\n                                                             \n\nsuit's  potential  for  adding   funds  to  the  government's\n\ncoffers, without more, should not be regarded as constituting\n                     \n\nuseful or proper return  to the government.  In  enacting the\n\n1943  amendments to  the FCA's  qui tam  provisions, Congress\n                                       \n\nclearly rejected the view (espoused in Hess, 317 U.S. at 545)\n                                           \n\nthat this  potentiality alone  was sufficient to  render non-\n                             \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nparasitic (and therefore  viable) a qui  tam action which  is\n                                            \n\ncompletely derivative of another case in which the government\n          \n\nis  a party.  And, while the 1986 amendments certainly reveal\n\nan  intent to recharacterize as \"non-parasitic\" actions which\n\nwould have  been considered  \"parasitic\" under the  1943-1986\n\nregime  (which regarded  as \"parasitic\"  all qui  tam actions\n                                                     \n\nbased upon  evidence or  information the government  had when\n\nthe action was brought), nothing in these amendments suggests\n\na congressional  desire to return to  the 1863-1943, pre-Hess\n                                                             \n\nregime.\n\n          Turning to  the instant  appeal, we think  that two\n\nfacts combine to compel the conclusion that this case has the\n\npotential  of  providing \"useful  or  proper  return\" to  the\n\ngovernment,  and   therefore  is   not  \"parasitic\"   of  the\n\nCollection  case.   First,  the FDIC  (which we  shall assume\n\narguendo  to  be \"the  government\"  within the  meaning  of  \n        \n\n3730(e)(3)) was not proceeding against the defendants to this\n                   \n\naction,  for fraud  or  otherwise, in  the Collection  case.9\n\nTherefore, because this case is seeking  to remedy fraud that\n\nthe government has not yet  attempted to remedy, it is, as  a\n\nthreshold matter,  wholly unlike  the one  the drafters  of  \n\n3730(e)(3)  almost  certainly  had  in  mind  and  sought  to\n\n                    \n\n9.  Of the defendants named here, only  Fleet and Recoll were\nparties  to the Collection case.   Moreover, Fleet and Recoll\nwere only parties  to that  case because Prawer  had filed  a\n                                               \nseries of third-party claims against them.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\npreclude (i.e., a  qui tam action  based upon allegations  or\n                          \n\ntransactions  pleaded  by the  government  in  an attempt  to\n                                         \n\nrecover for fraud committed against it).\n\n          Second, it does not appear that the FDIC could have\n                                                             \n\nsued Fleet for fraud as part  of the Collection case as  that\n                                                             \n\ncase was constituted.   Had it attempted  to do so, the  FDIC\n                    \n\nnot  only would have been asserting, as a plaintiff, both the\n\nvalidity and  the invalidity  of the sued-upon  notes against\n\nseparate  defendants  in  the   same  lawsuit,  but  it  also\n\nseemingly  would   have  been  claiming   under  an  entirely\n\ndifferent  \"transaction or occurrence\" (i.e., the put-back of\n\nthe notes pursuant to the  Assistance Agreement) than the one\n\n(Prawer's making of the notes and alleged failure to  satisfy\n\nthem) which  was the subject  matter of the  Collection case.\n\nThis scenario  is not, of  course, allowed under  the Federal\n\nRules of Civil  Procedure.

At  oral argument,  when pressed  on this\n\npoint, defendants' attorneys acknowledged that their position\n\nnecessarily was predicated upon the view that qui tam actions\n                                                     \n\nwere  to be  avoided once  the government  had notice  of the\n\ntransactions  or allegations  giving  rise to  the actions.10\n\nHowever, such a  view must be rejected for two  reasons:  (1)\n\nCongress has explicitly deemed a \"notice\" regime insufficient\n\nto protect  the government  against false claims  (indeed, it\n\nwas precisely such  a regime that Congress  sought to abandon\n                            \n\nin  enacting the 1986 amendments); and  (2) Congress, when it\n\nwants to establish a notice regime, knows how to do so in far\n\nless ambiguous terms than those utilized in   3730(e)(3), see\n                                                             \n\n31 U.S.C.   3730(e)(2)(A) (precluding qui tam actions brought\n                                             \n\nagainst  members of  Congress, members  of the  judiciary, or\n\nsenior  executive branch  officials \"if  the action  is based\n\nupon evidence or information known to the Government when the\n\naction  was  brought\");   31  U.S.C.      3730(b)(4)   (1982)\n\n                    \n\n10.  After all, given  the facts noted  in the preceding  two\nparagraphs, the  most defendants here  can argue is  that the\ngovernment was, in the  Collection case, provided with notice\nof the allegedly fraudulent nature of put-back transaction.  \n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\n(superseded)  (precluding  all  qui  tam  actions  \"based  on\n                                        \n\nevidence or  information the  Government had when  the action\n\nwas brought\").\n\n          To  sum  up, the  instant  qui tam  action  has the\n                                            \n\npotential  for providing  \"useful  or proper  return\" to  the\n\ngovernment  in at least two  significant ways:   (1) it seeks\n\nrecovery from alleged defrauders  of the government for fraud\n\nthat  has  not  yet been  the  subject  of  a  claim  by  the\n\ngovernment;  and (2) it has the potential to restore money to\n\nthe  public fisc  that  would not  and  could not  have  been\n\nrestored in  the Collection case.   As such, we do  not think\n\nthat it can  be characterized as \"parasitic.\"   Therefore, we\n\nbelieve that  it would  undermine  the purposes  of the  1986\n\namendments  to  construe this  action  as  being \"based  upon\n\nallegations  or transactions  which are  the subject  of\" the\n\nCollection case.\n\nB.  Other Matters\n                 \n\n          We  recognize  that  defendants have  made  several\n\nalternative  arguments for  affirmance  in  their  respective\n\nbriefs.   We  also recognize  that  plaintiffs have  moved to\n\ndismiss Fleet and Recoll from this action.  Given the nascent\n\nstate  of this  litigation  (and  all  that this  implies  --\n\nincluding an undeveloped record, an inadequate period of time\n\nfor plaintiffs to have cured any defects in  their pleadings,\n\nand the lack of a full opportunity for the government to have\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nreviewed the pleadings, see 31 U.S.C.   3730(b)), however, we\n                           \n\ndecline either  to delve into defendants'  other arguments or\n\nto  grant  plaintiffs'  motion   to  dismiss  at  this  time.\n\nInstead,  we leave  these matters for  the district  court to\n\ndecide after the government determines whether or not it will\n            \n\nintervene.  So  too do  we leave  to the  district court  all\n\nrequests  for costs arising out of claims that this action is\n\nfrivolous  and  has been  undertaken in  bad  faith.   To the\n\nextent that any such request may be predicated on an argument\n\nthat this appeal was frivolous, it is rejected.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the  reasons explained  above, we do  not think\n\nthat the instant qui tam action \"is based upon allegations or\n                        \n\ntransactions which  are the subject of\"  the Collection case.\n\nAccordingly,  the  district  court  erred  in dismissing  sua\n                                                             \n\nsponte plaintiffs'  complaint  on the  basis of  31 U.S.C.   \n      \n\n3730(e)(3).   The judgment of the district court therefore is\n\nvacated.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.  No costs.\n                                          \n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n",

Prawer &amp; Company, Gilbert\n\nPrawer, and Harvey Prawer (collectively \"Prawer\") as relators\n\nunder  the  False Claims  Act (\"FCA\"),  31  U.S.C.    3729 et\n                                                             \n\nseq.1   Plaintiffs  primarily2 contend  that the  court erred\n    \n\nin  concluding  that 31  U.S.C.     3730(e)(3),3 a  provision\n\nenacted  as  part  of the  1986  amendments  to  the qui  tam\n                                                             \n\nprovisions of the FCA, bars their claim.  The issue is one of\n\nfirst  impression, as no other  court has as  yet been called\n\nupon to  interpret the  reach and meaning  of this  ambiguous\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because  of  the  length   of  the  statutory  provisions\nrelevant to this appeal, we have attached them in an appendix\nto our opinion.\n\n2.  Employing  an extremely  literal reading  of 31  U.S.C.  \n3730(b)(1) (an action brought under the FCA \"may be dismissed\nonly  if the  court  and the  Attorney  General give  written\nconsent to the dismissal  and their reasons for consenting\"),\nplaintiffs also argue that the court erred in proceeding  sua\n                                                             \nsponte and dismissing this action without the approval of the\n      \nAttorney General.   Because, as  will be discussed  infra, we\n                                                         \nbelieve the court erred  in determining that this  action was\njurisdictionally  barred, we need not and  do not address the\nmerits  of this somewhat dubious assertion.  See Fed. R. Civ.\n                                                \nP.  12(h)(3)  (\"Whenever  it  appears by  suggestion  of  the\nparties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the\n                    \nsubject  matter,  the  court   shall  dismiss  the  action.\")\n                                    \n(emphasis added).\n\n3.

Relevant Factual and Procedural History\n                                           \n\n          The  relevant facts  and allegations,  recounted in\n\nthe  light most favorable to plaintiffs, are as follows.4  In\n\nJanuary 1991,  the Maine  National Bank (\"MNB\")  was declared\n\ninsolvent  and  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation\n\n(\"FDIC\")  was appointed its receiver.  The New Maine National\n\nBank (\"NMNB\") was established as  a bridge bank through which\n\nthe FDIC would conduct certain MNB-related affairs.\n\n          On or about July 12, 1991, the NMNB closed, and the\n\nFDIC sold virtually all of its assets to Fleet Bank  of Maine\n\n(\"Fleet\").  The contract by which this transfer of assets was\n\neffectuated is  known as  the \"Assistance Agreement.\"   Inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, the  Assistance Agreement  provided that Fleet  had the\n    \n\nright to \"put,\"  or cause  the FDIC to  repurchase, any  NMNB\n\nloans  acquired by  it pursuant  to the  Assistance Agreement\n\n                    \n\n4.  A few of the following  facts and allegations appear only\nin  plaintiffs' brief.  Because  they help shed  light on the\nconvoluted  factual underpinnings of this litigation and have\nno effect on  our resolution  of the question  before us,  we\nhave  included   them  in   our  recitation  of   the  case's\nbackground.   Our  inclusion of  these facts  and allegations\nshould not, however, be construed either as an endorsement of\ntheir  veracity  or as  an  indication  that  they are  well-\npleaded.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n(provided  that said  loans  did not  fall  into any  one  of\n\nseveral  exceptional categories  described in  the Assistance\n\nAgreement).  Included among  the transferred assets were five\n\npromissory notes, totalling approximately $1.1 million, given\n\nby  Prawer to  the NMNB.   The  notes represented  the amount\n\nPrawer had drawn against a $2 million line of credit extended\n\nto it by NMNB.\n\n          On  July  15,  1991,  Prawer  entered  into  a  new\n\nagreement with Fleet for  an unsecured line of credit  (known\n\nas the \"Fleet Credit Facility\") which permitted it to draw up\n\nto $2  million  by  executing  and/or  renewing  consecutive,\n\nunsecured 90-day term notes on  a note-by-note basis.  Prawer\n\nutilized  this new line of credit from Fleet to satisfy fully\n\nits  obligations  under each  of  the  five outstanding  NMNB\n\nnotes.  By May 5, 1992, Prawer had drawn $1.6 million against\n\nits  $2  million  line  of  credit  under  the  Fleet  Credit\n\nFacility.  These borrowings were evidenced by seven unsecured\n\n90-day term notes.\n\n          Meanwhile, on April 30, 1992, Prawer sold virtually\n\nall  of its  then-existing assets  to C&amp;S  Wholesale Grocers,\n\nInc. (\"C&amp;S\").  Gilbert  Prawer informed Fleet of the  sale on\n\nMay 1,  1992.   On May  6, 1992,  pursuant to  the Assistance\n\nAgreement, Fleet put  certain Prawer notes back  to the FDIC.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nThe parties hotly contest, however, whether  any of the notes\n\nwere \"putable\" under the terms of the Assistance Agreement.5\n\n          1.  The Collection Case\n\n          Subsequently, in November  1992, the FDIC commenced\n\nan action  against Prawer,  C&amp;S, and  a number of  individual\n\ndefendants  to collect upon the notes put back to it pursuant\n\nto the  Assistance Agreement.   The complaint in  that action\n\nnot only sought  enforcement of the  notes, but also  alleged\n\nthat  the  April 30,  1992, sale  of  Prawer's assets  to C&amp;S\n\nconstituted a fraudulent conveyance and violated Maine's Bulk\n\nSale Act.  More specifically, the FDIC contended that  Prawer\n\nhad become  insolvent, and  had peddled  its assets  for less\n\nthan  full value  in order  to satisfy  its debts  to certain\n\ncreditors.  Accordingly, the complaint sought  damages beyond\n\nthe amount allegedly outstanding on the notes.\n\n          Prawer  responded to  this  complaint with  several\n\naffirmative defenses  and counterclaims, as well  as filing a\n\nthird-party complaint  against  Fleet and  Recoll  Management\n\nCorporation  (\"Recoll\"),   a  Fleet  subsidiary   which  had,\n\npursuant  to  an agreement  with  the FDIC,  been  seeking to\n\n                    \n\n5.  It  has been and is plaintiffs' position that none of the\n                                                      \nnotes   were  properly  putable;  defendants  apparently  now\nconcede  that some  of  the notes  were  not putable  because\n                  \nplaintiffs' obligations thereunder had been  fully satisfied,\nbut argue that certain other notes were, in fact, putable.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ncollect upon  the notes which were  put back to the  FDIC.  A\n\nvariety   of   charges   were   made   in   these   defenses,\n\ncounterclaims,  and third-party  claims;  among these  was an\n\nassertion  that  the  notes  were  not  putable  to  the FDIC\n\npursuant to the Assistance Agreement.  But see infra note 6.\n                                                    \n\n          At  oral argument,  the  parties represented  that,\n\nsince the filing ofthis case, the Collection casehas settled.\n\n          2.  The Qui Tam Case\n                         \n\n          On June 21, 1993,  plaintiffs filed the instant qui\n                                                             \n\ntam action.   In  their complaint, plaintiffs  contended that\n   \n\nthe  named defendants --  Fleet, Recoll, Verrill  &amp; Dana (the\n\nlaw firm that served  as legal counsel to Fleet,  Recoll, and\n\nthe FDIC at all  times relevant to this matter),  P. Benjamin\n\nZuckerman  and Anne  M.

In  a comprehensive memorandum  of\n\ndecision, the court rejected both of these arguments (as well\n\nas  all other arguments made  in plaintiffs' motion).   In so\n\ndoing, however, the court  receded slightly from its original\n\nholding  on the  question of  whether there  was an  identity\n\nbetween  the  allegations and  transactions  which  were \"the\n\nsubject  of\" the Collection case and those that served as the\n\nbasis for the qui tam action.  Instead, the court found:\n                     \n\n               To  the  extent that  defenses based\n          upon  the  allegations  of  the  qui  tam\n                                                   \n          complaint  are not pleaded in the related\n          civil action, that is entirely the result\n          of the conscious decision of  counsel for\n          the  defendants   there  (and  Plaintiffs\n          here) to abjure  their pleading.  Clearly\n          the  factual  predicate  for   the  false\n          claims alleged in the qui tam action form\n                                       \n          the   basis   for  assertion   of  viable\n          defenses  to the claims  made against the\n          defendant  S.

An\n          effective defense to  those claims  would\n          require  that  those defenses  be pleaded\n          there if counsel, in good faith,  believe\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          the facts put  forth here.  . .  .   This\n          Court    believes    that   the    proper\n          construction  of [   3730(e)(3)] requires\n          that  it  be   read  broadly  enough   to\n          encompass   not   only  allegations   and\n          transactions actually put in issue by the\n          litigants in the  related civil suit  but\n          any  allegations   or  transactions  that\n          could  legitimately  be  made  a  subject\n          (e.g., [sic]  be  put in  issue) of  that\n               \n          suit  in   the  regular  course   of  its\n          development.\n\nUnited States ex rel.

The Statutory Framework\n                           \n\n          Because  our resolution of  the issue  presented in\n\nthis appeal  necessarily is informed by  Congress's intent in\n\nenacting the 1986 amendments to the FCA's qui tam provisions,\n                                                 \n\na  brief historical overview of the statute is in order.  The\n\nFCA's  qui  tam7  provisions,   see  generally  31  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n                    \n\n6.  Our  review  of  the  pleadings in  the  Collection  case\nreveals  that  it  is a  close  question  as  to whether  the\nillegitimacy of  the put (on  grounds of fraud)  actually was\nraised therein  as an affirmative defense.   However, because\n                                         \nwe find that    3730(e)(3) does not  bar this action  even if\nthe  fraud  claim was  so raised,  we  will assume  this fact\narguendo  and will  not address  the district  court's ruling\n        \nthat  the  statute  also  bars qui  tam  actions  based  upon\n                                       \nallegations or  transactions that  could have been  raised in\n                                             \nanother   civil  action   or  administrative   money  penalty\nproceeding.   \n\n7.  \"Qui tam\" is an abbreviation for \"qui tam pro domino rege\n                                                             \nquam pro seipso,\" which  literally means \"he who as  much for\n               \nthe  king as for himself.\"  United States ex rel.

The Jurisdictional Question\n                               \n\n          As they did  before the district  court, plaintiffs\n\nhere  argue that  (1) the  FDIC  is not,  for  purposes of   \n\n3730(e)(3), \"the  government\"; and (2) the  instant action is\n\nnot  \"based upon  allegations or  transactions which  are the\n\nsubject of\" the Collection  case.  See supra note 3.  Because\n                                            \n\nwe  believe  that  the second  of  these  two  contentions is\n\nultimately  persuasive,  and  that  the statutory  bar  of   \n\n3730(e)(3)  therefore does not  apply, we turn  our sights to\n\nthis provision of the statute.\n\n          We start  by noting the obvious:   the breadth with\n\nwhich we should read  the phrase \"allegations or transactions\n\nwhich  are  the  subject of  a  civil  suit\"  is not  readily\n                           \n\napparent from the  text of the statute.  Defendants' argument\n\nthat,  because plaintiffs  denied the  legitimacy of  the put\n\ntransaction (alleging fraud) in the Collection case, there is\n\nan identity  between the  allegations and transactions  which\n\nwere  at least  a  \"subject  of\"  that  case  and  the  fraud\n\nallegations which serve as \"the basis\" of this case certainly\n\nstrikes us as being anchored upon a plausible construction of\n\nthe  phrase  \"the  subject of\"  in     3730(e)(3).   So  too,\n\nhowever, does  plaintiffs' argument  that, when viewed  at an\n\nappropriate   level  of  specificity,  the  transactions  and\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nallegations which  are \"the  subject of\" the  Collection case\n                           \n\nshould and  must be seen only  as Prawer's (1)  making of the\n\nsued-upon  notes, and  (2) alleged  failure to  satisfy them.\n\nTherefore, we regard the statute as ambiguous.\n\n          When  faced  with  a  facially  ambiguous statutory\n\nprovision, we look to the statute as  a whole and the history\n\nof  its enactment  in  order to  glean congressional  intent.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Concrete Pipe  &amp;  Prods.,  Inc. v.

It seems\n\nclear  that  the answer  to  this  question is  circumstances\n\ninvolving \"parasitic\" qui tam actions which are not otherwise\n                             \n\nbarred  by    3730(e).   Cf.,  e.g., Quinn,  14  F.3d at  651\n                                          \n\n(interpreting   the  1986   amendments   as  \"still   another\n\ncongressional effort to reconcile avoidance of parasitism and\n\nencouragement  of  legitimate citizen  enforcement actions\").\n\nThus, when  it is not clear  whether or not a  qui tam action\n                                                      \n\nshould be  barred by  the ambiguous provision  precluding the\n\naction if it is \"based upon transactions or allegations which\n\nare the subject of\"  another suit or proceeding in  which the\n\ngovernment  is a  party, we  think that  a court  should look\n\nfirst  to whether  the two  cases can  properly be  viewed as\n\nhaving  the qualities  of a  host/parasite relationship.   In\n\nanswering  this question, we think it would be useful for the\n\ncourt  to be guided by the definition of the word \"parasite,\"\n\nand  ask whether  the  qui tam  case  is receiving  \"support,\n                              \n\nadvantage,  or the like\" from  the \"host\" case  (in which the\n\ngovernment is a  party) \"without giving any useful  or proper\n\nreturn\" to the  government (or at least  having the potential\n\nto  do so).    See Random  House  Dictionary of  the  English\n                                                             \n\nLanguage  1409 (2d ed. unabridged 1987).  If this question is\n        \n\nanswered in the affirmative,  the court may properly conclude\n\nthat there is an identity between  \"the basis\" of the qui tam\n                                                             \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\naction  and \"the subject of\" the other suit or proceeding; if\n\nthis  question  is  answered   in  the  negative,  the  court\n\nsimilarly may gather that such an identity is lacking.\n\n          Of  course, because Congress's intuition as to what\n\nconstitutes  \"potential useful  and  proper  return\"  to  the\n\ngovernment  clearly changed  with the  enactment of  the 1986\n\namendments,  our endorsement  of this  inquiry would  beg the\n\nquestion  entirely without  two  further points.   While  the\n\nquestion of  what now constitutes potential  useful or proper\n\nreturn to the government  will not always be  easily answered\n\nand must necessarily be addressed on a case-by-case basis, we\n\nbelieve it important to  note that one of the  most important\n\nperceptions   precipitating  the  1986  amendments  was  that\n\nactions which had the potential of providing such return were\n\nbeing precluded  by the  then-existing statutory regime.   In\n\nlight of  this, we  feel courts  should proceed with  caution\n\nbefore  applying  the  statutory   bar  of     3730(e)(3)  in\n\nambiguous circumstances.\n\n          On the other hand, we think it clear that a qui tam\n                                                             \n\nsuit's  potential  for  adding   funds  to  the  government's\n\ncoffers, without more, should not be regarded as constituting\n                     \n\nuseful or proper return  to the government.  In  enacting the\n\n1943  amendments to  the FCA's  qui tam  provisions, Congress\n                                       \n\nclearly rejected the view (espoused in Hess, 317 U.S. at 545)\n                                           \n\nthat this  potentiality alone  was sufficient to  render non-\n                             \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nparasitic (and therefore  viable) a qui  tam action which  is\n                                            \n\ncompletely derivative of another case in which the government\n          \n\nis  a party.  And, while the 1986 amendments certainly reveal\n\nan  intent to recharacterize as \"non-parasitic\" actions which\n\nwould have  been considered  \"parasitic\" under the  1943-1986\n\nregime  (which regarded  as \"parasitic\"  all qui  tam actions\n                                                     \n\nbased upon  evidence or  information the government  had when\n\nthe action was brought), nothing in these amendments suggests\n\na congressional  desire to return to  the 1863-1943, pre-Hess\n                                                             \n\nregime.\n\n          Turning to  the instant  appeal, we think  that two\n\nfacts combine to compel the conclusion that this case has the\n\npotential  of  providing \"useful  or  proper  return\" to  the\n\ngovernment,  and   therefore  is   not  \"parasitic\"   of  the\n\nCollection  case.   First,  the FDIC  (which we  shall assume\n\narguendo  to  be \"the  government\"  within the  meaning  of  \n        \n\n3730(e)(3)) was not proceeding against the defendants to this\n                   \n\naction,  for fraud  or  otherwise, in  the Collection  case.9\n\nTherefore, because this case is seeking  to remedy fraud that\n\nthe government has not yet  attempted to remedy, it is, as  a\n\nthreshold matter,  wholly unlike  the one  the drafters  of  \n\n3730(e)(3)  almost  certainly  had  in  mind  and  sought  to\n\n                    \n\n9.  Of the defendants named here, only  Fleet and Recoll were\nparties  to the Collection case.   Moreover, Fleet and Recoll\nwere only parties  to that  case because Prawer  had filed  a\n                                               \nseries of third-party claims against them.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\npreclude (i.e., a  qui tam action  based upon allegations  or\n                          \n\ntransactions  pleaded  by the  government  in  an attempt  to\n                                         \n\nrecover for fraud committed against it).\n\n          Second, it does not appear that the FDIC could have\n                                                             \n\nsued Fleet for fraud as part  of the Collection case as  that\n                                                             \n\ncase was constituted.   Had it attempted  to do so, the  FDIC\n                    \n\nnot  only would have been asserting, as a plaintiff, both the\n\nvalidity and  the invalidity  of the sued-upon  notes against\n\nseparate  defendants  in  the   same  lawsuit,  but  it  also\n\nseemingly  would   have  been  claiming   under  an  entirely\n\ndifferent  \"transaction or occurrence\" (i.e., the put-back of\n\nthe notes pursuant to the  Assistance Agreement) than the one\n\n(Prawer's making of the notes and alleged failure to  satisfy\n\nthem) which  was the subject  matter of the  Collection case.\n\nThis scenario  is not, of  course, allowed under  the Federal\n\nRules of Civil  Procedure.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P.  14(a) (\"The\n                               \n\nplaintiff  may  assert  any  claim  against  the  third-party\n\ndefendant arising  out of the transaction  or occurrence that\n                                                             \n\nis the subject  matter of the  plaintiff's claim against  the\n                                                             \n\nthird-party plaintiff . . . .\") (emphasis supplied); see also\n                                                             \n\nC.

Minn. 1954)).\n\n          Another  way  to  look   at  this  question  is  to\n\ndetermine  whether defendants' construction of this ambiguous\n\nstatutory provision would further the purposes underlying the\n\n1986  amendments.   At  oral argument,  when pressed  on this\n\npoint, defendants' attorneys acknowledged that their position\n\nnecessarily was predicated upon the view that qui tam actions\n                                                     \n\nwere  to be  avoided once  the government  had notice  of the\n\ntransactions  or allegations  giving  rise to  the actions.10\n\nHowever, such a  view must be rejected for two  reasons:  (1)\n\nCongress has explicitly deemed a \"notice\" regime insufficient\n\nto protect  the government  against false claims  (indeed, it\n\nwas precisely such  a regime that Congress  sought to abandon\n                            \n\nin  enacting the 1986 amendments); and  (2) Congress, when it\n\nwants to establish a notice regime, knows how to do so in far\n\nless ambiguous terms than those utilized in   3730(e)(3), see\n                                                             \n\n31 U.S.C.   3730(e)(2)(A) (precluding qui tam actions brought\n                                             \n\nagainst  members of  Congress, members  of the  judiciary, or\n\nsenior  executive branch  officials \"if  the action  is based\n\nupon evidence or information known to the Government when the\n\naction  was  brought\");   31  U.S.C.      3730(b)(4)   (1982)\n\n                    \n\n10.  After all, given  the facts noted  in the preceding  two\nparagraphs, the  most defendants here  can argue is  that the\ngovernment was, in the  Collection case, provided with notice\nof the allegedly fraudulent nature of put-back transaction.  \n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\n(superseded)  (precluding  all  qui  tam  actions  \"based  on\n                                        \n\nevidence or  information the  Government had when  the action\n\nwas brought\").\n\n          To  sum  up, the  instant  qui tam  action  has the\n                                            \n\npotential  for providing  \"useful  or proper  return\" to  the\n\ngovernment  in at least two  significant ways:   (1) it seeks\n\nrecovery from alleged defrauders  of the government for fraud\n\nthat  has  not  yet been  the  subject  of  a  claim  by  the\n\ngovernment;  and (2) it has the potential to restore money to\n\nthe  public fisc  that  would not  and  could not  have  been\n\nrestored in  the Collection case.   As such, we do  not think\n\nthat it can  be characterized as \"parasitic.\"   Therefore, we\n\nbelieve that  it would  undermine  the purposes  of the  1986\n\namendments  to  construe this  action  as  being \"based  upon\n\nallegations  or transactions  which are  the subject  of\" the\n\nCollection case.\n\nB.  Other Matters\n                 \n\n          We  recognize  that  defendants have  made  several\n\nalternative  arguments for  affirmance  in  their  respective\n\nbriefs.   We  also recognize  that  plaintiffs have  moved to\n\ndismiss Fleet and Recoll from this action.  Given the nascent\n\nstate  of this  litigation  (and  all  that this  implies  --\n\nincluding an undeveloped record, an inadequate period of time\n\nfor plaintiffs to have cured any defects in  their pleadings,\n\nand the lack of a full opportunity for the government to have\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nreviewed the pleadings, see 31 U.S.C.   3730(b)), however, we\n                           \n\ndecline either  to delve into defendants'  other arguments or\n\nto  grant  plaintiffs'  motion   to  dismiss  at  this  time.\n\nInstead,  we leave  these matters for  the district  court to\n\ndecide after the government determines whether or not it will\n            \n\nintervene.  So  too do  we leave  to the  district court  all\n\nrequests  for costs arising out of claims that this action is\n\nfrivolous  and  has been  undertaken in  bad  faith.   To the\n\nextent that any such request may be predicated on an argument\n\nthat this appeal was frivolous, it is rejected.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the  reasons explained  above, we do  not think\n\nthat the instant qui tam action \"is based upon allegations or\n                        \n\ntransactions which  are the subject of\"  the Collection case.\n\nAccordingly,  the  district  court  erred  in dismissing  sua\n                                                             \n\nsponte plaintiffs'  complaint  on the  basis of  31 U.S.C.   \n      \n\n3730(e)(3).   The judgment of the district court therefore is\n\nvacated.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.  No costs.\n                                          \n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n</pre>",
