We affirm.\n\n                   I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                         \n\n          Appellant,  Radhame  Troncoso, from  the Dominican\n\nRepublic,  has  been   convicted  several   times  of   drug\n\ntrafficking and other related offenses in the United States.\n\nThe conviction  most relevant to  this appeal took  place on\n\nJanuary  25,  1988,  when   Appellant  was  convicted  in  a\n\nMassachusetts state court on charges including possession of\n\ncocaine  with intent  to distribute.   Appellant  served his\n\nprison sentence and was then turned over to officials of the\n\nImmigration  and  Naturalization   Service  (\"I.N.S.\")   who\n\ndeported him  on several grounds, including  conviction of a\n\ndrug  trafficking  offense.    The  deportation  occurred on\n\nOctober 26, 1988.  At that time, the I.N.S. warned Appellant\n\nthat if he  returned to the U.S. within five years, he would\n\nbe  guilty of  a felony and  subject to  up to  two years in\n\nprison as provided for by section 1326,  before that section\n\n                           - 2 -\n                            -2-\n\nwas amended  by the Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1988.   8 U.S.C.\n\n  1326.1 \n\n          Appellant  did  return  undetected to  the  United\n\nStates at some point and was convicted in New York on August\n\n29,  1991,  on drug-related  charges  but  was not  deported\n\nfollowing his incarceration.2  He was later arrested  in New\n\nHampshire on October 30, 1992, convicted of selling cocaine,\n\nand  received a suspended sentence in April of 1993.  He was\n\nalso charged with violating  section 1326(b)(2) based on his\n\nearlier deportation in connection with the January 25, 1988,\n\nconviction.   Section  1326(b)(2),  which  had been  amended\n\nsince Appellant's  conviction and deportation,  enhanced the\n\n                    \n\n          *Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\n1Prior to the enactment  of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act  of 1988\n(\"ADAA\"), section 1326 provided  for a maximum two-year term\n                                                       \nof  imprisonment  for  any  alien who  had  been  previously\narrested  and  deported  and  was  thereafter  convicted  of\nreentry, attempted \nreentry,  or  being  found  in  the  United  States  without\npermission.   8  U.S.C.   1326  (1987).   When the  ADAA was\nenacted on  November 18, 1988,  section 1326 was  amended to\nprovide for a maximum  fifteen-year term of imprisonment for\n                                   \nany alien  who was convicted of  reentry, attempted reentry,\nor  being found  in  the U.S.  after having  been previously\narrested  and  deported  subsequent  to  a   conviction  for\ncommission   of   an   aggravated    felony.      8   U.S.C.\n  1326(b)(2)(Supp. 1993).\n\n2The  Government  argues  that  Appellant was  not  deported\nfollowing the New  York conviction because he  used an alias\nwhich prevented I.N.S. agents from identifying him.\n\n                           - 3 -\n                            -3-\n\nmaximum  penalty for  unlawful reentry  from two  to fifteen\n\nyears  for  aliens  who  had  been  deported  subsequent  to\n\nconviction  for  committing an  aggravated  felony.   See  8\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    1326(b)(2)(Supp.  1993).    On  August  30,  1993,\n\nAppellant  was  convicted  and  sentenced to  60  months  in\n\nprison.  \n\n                      II.  DISCUSSION\n                                     \n\n          Appellant challenges the  district court's  denial\n\nof  his  motion  to  dismiss the  indictment,  arguing  that\n\nCongress did  not intend for section  1326(b)(2), as amended\n\nby  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act  of 1988, to apply retroactively\n\nto persons  who  were convicted  and deported  prior to  the\n\nAct's  effective date.   8  U.S.C.   1326(b)(2).   Appellant\n\nargues, in the alternative, that applying section 1326(b)(2)\n\nretroactively  to his case violates the ex post facto Clause\n                                                     \n\nof the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const. art. I,   9,\n\ncl.  3.   He  also argues  that  the doctrines  of equitable\n\nestoppel  and estoppel  by entrapment  bar the  court, as  a\n\nmatter of law, from sentencing him beyond a two-year term of\n\nimprisonment in light of  the representations made by I.N.S.\n\nagents  at the time of  his deportation.   Lastly, he argues\n\nthat the  district court erred by treating his New Hampshire\n\nstate conviction as a \"prior sentence,\"  rather than as part\n\n                           - 4 -\n                            -4-\n\nof  the  instant offense  of  violating section  1326(b)(2),\n\npursuant   to   section   4A1.2(a)(1)   of   the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(a)(1).\n\n                 A.  Statutory Construction\n                                           \n\n          Appellant's    first     argument    focuses    on\n\nCongressional  intent   with  respect  to   the  retroactive\n\napplication  of  section  1326(b).    8  U.S.C.    1326(b).3\n\n                    \n\n3Section 1326 provides in pertinent part that:\n\n               (a) Subject to subsection (b),\n               any alien who --\n\n                    (1)     has     been\n                    arrested         and\n                    deported or excluded\n                    and   deported,  and\n                    thereafter\n\n                    (2) enters, attempts\n                    to  enter, or  is at\n                    any  time found  in,\n                    t h e    U n i t e d\n                    States . . . \n\n               shall be fined under Title 18,\n               United    States    Code,   or\n               imprisoned  not  more  than  2\n               years or both.\n\n               (b) Notwithstanding subsection\n               (a), in the case of  any alien\n               described  in  such subsection\n               -- \n                         .      .  \n                         .     .   \n                         .   \n                    ( 2 )      w h o s e\n                    deportation      was\n\n                           - 5 -\n                            -5-\n\nSection 1326(b) was added to the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct  (\"INA\") on November 18, 1988, when Congress enacted the\n\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act  of 1988 (\"ADAA\"). See  Pub. L. 100-690,\n                                          \n\nTitle VII,  Subtitle J,   7345(a), 102  Stat. 4471 (codified\n\nas amended  at 8  U.S.C.   1326(b)(1988)).   Apart  from the\n\nstatutory text,  the Act provided that  the amendment adding\n\nsection  1326(b)  \"shall  apply  to any  alien  who  enters,\n\nattempts to enter, or  is found in, the United  States on or\n\nafter the date of the enactment of this Act.\"  The ADAA also\n\nadded  a provision  to  the INA  defining  the new  term  of\n\n\"aggravated  felony\" to include  murder, illicit trafficking\n\nin any controlled substance, money laundering, and crimes of\n\nviolence  carrying at  least 5 years  of imprisonment.   See\n                                                            \n\nPub. L.  100-690, Title VII,  Subtitle J,   7342,  102 Stat.\n\n4469  (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C.   1101(a)(43)(1988)).\n\nThe  Act did  not include  a section  limiting  the temporal\n\napplicability of the \"aggravated felony\" definition.  \n\n                    \n\n                    subsequent    to   a\n                    conviction       for\n                    commission   of   an\n                    aggravated   felony,\n                    such alien shall  be\n                    fined   under   such\n                    title,    imprisoned\n                    not  more  than   15\n                    years, or both.\n\n          8 U.S.C.   1326 (Supp. 1993).\n\n                           - 6 -\n                            -6-\n\n          The parties do  not dispute that  Appellant's drug\n\nconviction,  which precipitated  his deportation  on October\n\n26, 1988,  falls into the definition  of \"aggravated felony\"\n\nin section 1101(a)(43).   8 U.S.C.   1101(a)(43).  The issue\n\nin  dispute  is   whether  Congress  intended  for   section\n\n1326(b)(2), as it incorporates section 1101(a)(43), to apply\n\nretroactively  to an  alien who  was convicted  and deported\n\nprior  to the ADAA amendments.   In Matter  of A-A-, Interim\n                                                   \n\nDec.  3176  (BIA 1992),  the  Board  of Immigration  Appeals\n\ninterpreted the  plain language  of the  amended provisions,\n\nalong  with the  applicability section  accompanying section\n\n1326(b),  and  concluded   that  the  enhanced  fifteen-year\n\ncriminal penalty is:\n\n               applicable  to `any  alien who\n               enters,  attempts to  enter or\n               is found in, the United States\n               on  or  after   the  date   of\n               enactment of [the November 18,\n               1988]  Act.' . . .     For  an\n               alien  reentering  the  United\n               States  on November  18, 1988,\n               to   be   subject   to   these\n               criminal penalties,  the alien\n               would need to have  suffered a\n               conviction   and   deportation\n               before November 18, 1988.   It\n               would be virtually  impossible\n               for an alien  convicted of  an\n               aggravated  felony to  reenter\n               or  be  found  in  the  United\n               States   on    the   date   of\n               enactment      unless      the\n               definition    of    aggravated\n\n                           - 7 -\n                            -7-\n\n               felony   included  convictions\n               occurring before that date. \n\nThis  Court  adopted  the  BIA's reasoning  in  Barreiro  v.\n                                                            \n\nI.N.S.,   989  F.2d   62   (1st  Cir.   1993)(upholding  the\n      \n\nretroactive application of  the aggravated felony definition\n\nas  it  was  incorporated  into a  \"waiver  of  deportation\"\n\nprovision,  serving to  bar  a  seven-year domiciliate  from\n\nseeking a waiver from deportation pursuant to section 212(c)\n\nof the INA, 8 U.S.C.   1182(c)(Supp. 1992)).  In a case very\n\nsimilar to the facts  at hand, U.S. v. Forbes, 16  F.3d 1294\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir.  1994),  this  Court upheld  a  conviction  under\n\nsection  1326(b)(2) based  on aggravated  felony convictions\n\nthat  occurred  prior  to  the effective  date  of  the ADAA\n\namendments.  In oral argument, Appellant was unable to point\n\nto  any case  law in  support of  his position  that section\n\n1326(b)(2)  was  not intended  to be  applied retroactively.\n\nGiven the law of this  circuit and the plain meaning  of the\n\nprovision,  we affirm  the  district court's  application of\n\nsection 1326(b)(2) to Appellant's conviction.\n\n            B.  Alleged Ex Post Facto Violation\n                                               \n\n          Appellant  argues that  even if  Congress intended\n\nfor  section 1326(b)(2)  to  be  applied retroactively,  the\n\neffect of retroactive  application in his situation  results\n\nin  a  violation  of the  ex  post  facto  provision of  the\n                                         \n\n                           - 8 -\n                            -8-\n\nConstitution.  See U.S.  Const. art. I,   9, cl.  3 (barring\n                  \n\nthe  retrospective  application  of  laws   that  materially\n\ndisadvantage  a  defendant).    Appellant  argues  that  the\n\nGovernment  failed  to  present   evidence  ruling  out  the\n\npossibility that he returned to the United States subsequent\n\nto his October, 1988, deportation but prior to  November 18,\n\n1988,  when the ADAA amendments went into effect.  He argues\n\nthat an ex post facto violation has occurred with respect to\n                     \n\nhim and the class  of convicted-and-deported aliens who were\n\nin  the country  on the  date of  enactment because  \"such a\n\nperson's status is changed, and liability thus increased, by\n\nan act, of  the legislature,  of which such  persons had  no\n                           \n\nnotice, nor  opportunity to avoid, even  given such notice.\"\n\nAppellant's Brief at 27.  \n\n          In Forbes, this Court held that the inclusion of a\n                   \n\ndefendant's prior drug convictions  to trigger the  enhanced\n\ncriminal penalties of section 1326(b)(2) did not violate the\n\nex  post  facto  Clause,  where  the  convictions  had  been\n               \n\nobtained prior to the  ADAA amendments.

Burke, 334 U.S. 728 (1948), this\n                                 \n\nCourt  reasoned  that   the  enhanced  fifteen-year  penalty\n\napplies  to the  crime  of  unlawful  reentry and  does  not\n\nincrease the  punishment for  crimes committed prior  to the\n\n                           - 9 -\n                            -9-\n\nADAA amendments.  Id. at 1302.   Appellant distinguishes his\n                     \n\nsituation  by  pointing out  that  the  appellant in  Forbes\n                                                            \n\ncommitted the offense of  unlawful reentry after the amended\n                                                \n\nsection  went  into  effect,   whereas  Appellant  may  have\n\ncommitted the offense of unlawful  reentry prior to the ADAA\n\namendments.   But  section 1326(a)(2)  defines the  criminal\n\nconduct  more  expansively   to  include  entry,   attempted\n\nreentry,  or  being  found  in  the  United  States  without\n                              \n\npermission.  Appellant was  indicted and convicted of \"being\n\nfound  in  the  United   States\"  in  violation  of  section\n\n1326(b)(2).   His offense occurred on October 30, 1992, well\n\nafter  the  ADAA  amendments and  not  on  the  date of  his\n\nundetected  reentry.   Hence, Appellant  fails to  satisfy a\n\ncritical element for establishing that a criminal law has ex\n                                                            \n\npost facto effect; he  fails to demonstrate that the  law is\n          \n\n\"retrospective, that  is, it must apply  to events occurring\n\nbefore  its enactment.\"  Weaver  v.

Sentencing:  Entrapment by Estoppel and Equitable\n                                                        \n\nEstoppel\n        \n\n          Appellant argues that the court should be estopped\n\nfrom   sentencing   him   beyond   two   years    based   on\n\nrepresentations  made   to  him  by  the   I.N.S.  upon  his\n\ndeportation, indicating that unlawful reentry  could subject\n\nhim to a  maximum two-year prison term.  The  Court need not\n\ndiscuss this  argument in detail because  Appellant fails to\n\nsatisfy threshold  elements of  the two  estoppel doctrines.\n\nFirst, with respect  to \"entrapment by estoppel,\"  Appellant\n\ncannot  show that a  government official erroneously advised\n\nhim that the particular  act for which he was  convicted was\n\nactually  legal at the time it was committed.  United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Smith, 940  F.2d 710, 714 (1st Cir.  1991).  Second, with\n        \n\nrespect to equitable estoppel, Appellant cannot show that he\n\nrelied upon a material misrepresentation, because the I.N.S.\n\ninformed  Appellant that he would  face up to  two years for\n\nunlawful  reentry which was an accurate rendition of the law\n\nas it existed on  the date of Appellant's deportation.   See\n                                                            \n\nHeckler v. Community Health Services, Inc., 467 U.S. 51,  59\n                                          \n\n(1984); K-Mart Corp. v.

U.S.  v.   Smith,  14  F.3d  662  (1st   Cir.\n                               \n\n1994)(holding that, even where  defendant was misinformed as\n\nto the consequences  of unlawful reentry and stated  that he\n\nreturned  in  reliance  on  the  misrepresentation,  such  a\n\ncircumstance did  not  justify a  downward  departure  where\n                                                            \n\ndefendant made a purposeful  decision to engage in felonious\n                                                            \n\nconduct).   Hence,  Appellant's arguments regarding  the two\n       \n\nestoppel doctrines are unavailing.\n\nD.

U.S.S.G.    4A1.2(a)(1).4\n\nAppellant argues  that his  conduct in violation  of section\n\n1326(b)(2) came to light only through his arrest for selling\n\ncocaine.  Since \"he was found in this country in the process\n\nof committing that  [state] offense\", Appellant argues  that\n\nthe  offense conduct of selling cocaine  should be viewed as\n\npart  of  the instant  offense and  not  counted as  a prior\n\nsentence.  See Trial Transcript (Aug. 30, 1993) at 29-30. \n              \n\n          The  commentary  to  section 4A1.2 defines  \"prior\n\nsentence\" as \"a sentence imposed prior  to sentencing on the\n\ninstant offense, other  than a sentence for conduct  that is\n\npart of  the instant  offense.\"  U.S.S.G.    4A1.2, comment.\n\n(n.1).

Here, the  district\n\ncourt based its findings  on the Government's arguments that\n\nthe only  relation between Appellant's drug  selling conduct\n\nand his conduct in violating  section 1326(b)(2) is that the\n\nformer violation  set in motion  a chain  of events  whereby\n\nfederal agents  were able to  trace Appellant's fingerprints\n\nto those of Radhame Troncoso  and the I.N.S. then  retrieved\n\nhis file,  which led to the determination that Appellant was\n\nin the country in violation of 1326(b)(2).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, Radhame Troncoso, from the Dominican Republic, has been convicted several times of drug trafficking and other related offenses in the United States.  The conviction most relevant to this appeal took place on January 25, 1988, when Appellant was convicted in a Massachusetts state court on charges including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  Appellant served his prison sentence and was then turned over to officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"I.N.S.\") who deported him on several grounds, including conviction of a drug trafficking offense.  The deportation occurred on October 26, 1988.  At that time, the I.N.S. warned Appellant that if he returned to the U.S. within five years, he would be guilty of a felony and subject to up to two years in prison as provided for by section 1326, before that section was amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did return undetected to the United States at some point and was convicted in New York on August 29, 1991, on drug-related charges but was not deported following his incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He was later arrested in New Hampshire on October 30, 1992, convicted of selling cocaine, and received a suspended sentence in April of 1993.  He was also charged with violating section 1326(b)(2) based on his earlier deportation in connection with the January 25, 1988, conviction.  Section 1326(b)(2), which had been amended since Appellant's conviction and deportation, enhanced the maximum penalty for unlawful reentry from two to fifteen years for aliens who had been deported subsequent to conviction for committing an aggravated felony.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) (Supp.1993).  On August 30, 1993, Appellant was convicted and sentenced to 60 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Congress did not intend for section 1326(b)(2), as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, to apply retroactively to persons who were convicted and deported prior to the Act's effective date.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).  Appellant argues, in the alternative, that applying section 1326(b)(2) retroactively to his case violates the ex post facto Clause of the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3.  He also argues that the doctrines of equitable estoppel and estoppel by entrapment bar the court, as a matter of law, from sentencing him beyond a two-year term of imprisonment in light of the representations made by I.N.S. agents at the time of his deportation.  Lastly, he argues that the district court erred by treating his New Hampshire state conviction as a \"prior sentence,\" rather than as part of the instant offense of violating section 1326(b)(2), pursuant to section 4A1.2(a)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statutory Construction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first argument focuses on Congressional intent with respect to the retroactive application of section 1326(b).  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Section 1326(b) was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") on November 18, 1988, when Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (\"ADAA\").  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle J, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(1988)).  Apart from the statutory text, the Act provided that the amendment adding section 1326(b) \"shall apply to any alien who enters, attempts to enter, or is found in, the United States on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\"   The ADAA also added a provision to the INA defining the new term of \"aggravated felony\" to include murder, illicit trafficking in any controlled substance, money laundering, and crimes of violence carrying at least 5 years of imprisonment.  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle J, Sec. 7342, 102 Stat. 4469 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43) (1988)).  The Act did not include a section limiting the temporal applicability of the \"aggravated felony\" definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Appellant's drug conviction, which precipitated his deportation on October 26, 1988, falls into the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in section 1101(a)(43).  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43).  The issue in dispute is whether Congress intended for section 1326(b)(2), as it incorporates section 1101(a)(43), to apply retroactively to an alien who was convicted and deported prior to the ADAA amendments.  In Matter of A-A-, Interim Dec. 3176 (BIA 1992), the Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the plain language of the amended provisions, along with the applicability section accompanying section 1326(b), and concluded that the enhanced fifteen-year criminal penalty is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>applicable to 'any alien who enters, attempts to enter or is found in, the United States on or after the date of enactment of [the November 18, 1988] Act.'  ...  For an alien reentering the United States on November 18, 1988, to be subject to these criminal penalties, the alien would need to have suffered a conviction and deportation before November 18, 1988.  It would be virtually impossible for an alien convicted of an aggravated felony to reenter or be found in the United States on the date of enactment unless the definition of aggravated felony included convictions occurring before that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court adopted the BIA's reasoning in Barreiro v. I.N.S., 989 F.2d 62 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding the retroactive application of the aggravated felony definition as it was incorporated into a \"waiver of deportation\" provision, serving to bar a seven-year domiciliate from seeking a waiver from deportation pursuant to section 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c) (Supp.1992)).  In a case very similar to the facts at hand, U.S. v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294 (1st Cir.1994), this Court upheld a conviction under section 1326(b)(2) based on aggravated felony convictions that occurred prior to the effective date of the ADAA amendments.  In oral argument, Appellant was unable to point to any case law in support of his position that section 1326(b)(2) was not intended to be applied retroactively.  Given the law of this circuit and the plain meaning of the provision, we affirm the district court's application of section 1326(b)(2) to Appellant's conviction.B. Alleged Ex Post Facto Violation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that even if Congress intended for section 1326(b)(2) to be applied retroactively, the effect of retroactive application in his situation results in a violation of the ex post facto provision of the Constitution.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3 (barring the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage a defendant).  Appellant argues that the Government failed to present evidence ruling out the possibility that he returned to the United States subsequent to his October, 1988, deportation but prior to November 18, 1988, when the ADAA amendments went into effect.  He argues that an ex post facto violation has occurred with respect to him and the class of convicted-and-deported aliens who were in the country on the date of enactment because \"such a person's status is changed, and liability thus increased, by an act, of the legislature, of which such persons had no notice, nor opportunity to avoid, even given such notice.\"   Appellant's Brief at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Forbes, this Court held that the inclusion of a defendant's prior drug convictions to trigger the enhanced criminal penalties of section 1326(b)(2) did not violate the ex post facto Clause, where the convictions had been obtained prior to the ADAA amendments.  Forbes, 16 F.3d at 1301-02.   Citing Gryger v. Burke, 334 U.S. 728, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948), this Court reasoned that the enhanced fifteen-year penalty applies to the crime of unlawful reentry and does not increase the punishment for crimes committed prior to the ADAA amendments.  Id. at 1302.   Appellant distinguishes his situation by pointing out that the appellant in Forbes committed the offense of unlawful reentry after the amended section went into effect, whereas Appellant may have committed the offense of unlawful reentry prior to the ADAA amendments.  But section 1326(a)(2) defines the criminal conduct more expansively to include entry, attempted reentry, or being found in the United States without permission.  Appellant was indicted and convicted of \"being found in the United States\" in violation of section 1326(b)(2).  His offense occurred on October 30, 1992, well after the ADAA amendments and not on the date of his undetected reentry.  Hence, Appellant fails to satisfy a critical element for establishing that a criminal law has ex post facto effect;  he fails to demonstrate that the law is \"retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment.\"  Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981);  see also U.S. v.

The Court need not discuss this argument in detail because Appellant fails to satisfy threshold elements of the two estoppel doctrines.  First, with respect to \"entrapment by estoppel,\" Appellant cannot show that a government official erroneously advised him that the particular act for which he was convicted was actually legal at the time it was committed.  United States v. Smith, 940 F.2d 710, 714 (1st Cir.1991).  Second, with respect to equitable estoppel, Appellant cannot show that he relied upon a material misrepresentation, because the I.N.S. informed Appellant that he would face up to two years for unlawful reentry which was an accurate rendition of the law as it existed on the date of Appellant's deportation.  See Heckler v. Community Health Services, Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2223-24, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984);  K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 912 (1st Cir.1989) (defining elements of equitable estoppel to include a material misrepresentation of a party who had reason to know of its falsity and reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation to the charging party's disadvantage). Further, this Court has recently held that even where the I.N.S. erroneously informed a deportee of the penalty faced upon reentry, such an error is not a mitigating factor justifying a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.  U.S. v. Smith, 14 F.3d 662 (1st Cir.1944) (holding that, even where defendant was misinformed as to the consequences of unlawful reentry and stated that he returned in reliance on the misrepresentation, such a circumstance did not justify a downward departure where defendant made a purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct ).  Hence, Appellant's arguments regarding the two estoppel doctrines are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>D.

Sec. 3742(e).  Here, the district court based its findings on the Government's arguments that the only relation between Appellant's drug selling conduct and his conduct in violating section 1326(b)(2) is that the former violation set in motion a chain of events whereby federal agents were able to trace Appellant's fingerprints to those of Radhame Troncoso and the I.N.S. then retrieved his file, which led to the determination that Appellant was in the country in violation of 1326(b)(2).

The Government argued there was no other connection between the conduct involved in the drug offense and the 1326(b)(2) violation especially where the state prosecutor and the United States Attorney had to prove totally different elements with respect to each offense.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, Radhame Troncoso, from the Dominican Republic, has been convicted several times of drug trafficking and other related offenses in the United States.  The conviction most relevant to this appeal took place on January 25, 1988, when Appellant was convicted in a Massachusetts state court on charges including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  Appellant served his prison sentence and was then turned over to officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"I.N.S.\") who deported him on several grounds, including conviction of a drug trafficking offense.  The deportation occurred on October 26, 1988.  At that time, the I.N.S. warned Appellant that if he returned to the U.S. within five years, he would be guilty of a felony and subject to up to two years in prison as provided for by section 1326, before that section was amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did return undetected to the United States at some point and was convicted in New York on August 29, 1991, on drug-related charges but was not deported following his incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He was later arrested in New Hampshire on October 30, 1992, convicted of selling cocaine, and received a suspended sentence in April of 1993.  He was also charged with violating section 1326(b)(2) based on his earlier deportation in connection with the January 25, 1988, conviction.  Section 1326(b)(2), which had been amended since Appellant's conviction and deportation, enhanced the maximum penalty for unlawful reentry from two to fifteen years for aliens who had been deported subsequent to conviction for committing an aggravated felony.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) (Supp.1993).  On August 30, 1993, Appellant was convicted and sentenced to 60 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Congress did not intend for section 1326(b)(2), as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, to apply retroactively to persons who were convicted and deported prior to the Act's effective date.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).  Appellant argues, in the alternative, that applying section 1326(b)(2) retroactively to his case violates the ex post facto Clause of the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3.  He also argues that the doctrines of equitable estoppel and estoppel by entrapment bar the court, as a matter of law, from sentencing him beyond a two-year term of imprisonment in light of the representations made by I.N.S. agents at the time of his deportation.  Lastly, he argues that the district court erred by treating his New Hampshire state conviction as a \"prior sentence,\" rather than as part of the instant offense of violating section 1326(b)(2), pursuant to section 4A1.2(a)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statutory Construction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first argument focuses on Congressional intent with respect to the retroactive application of section 1326(b).  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Section 1326(b) was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") on November 18, 1988, when Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (\"ADAA\").  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle J, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(1988)).  Apart from the statutory text, the Act provided that the amendment adding section 1326(b) \"shall apply to any alien who enters, attempts to enter, or is found in, the United States on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\"   The ADAA also added a provision to the INA defining the new term of \"aggravated felony\" to include murder, illicit trafficking in any controlled substance, money laundering, and crimes of violence carrying at least 5 years of imprisonment.  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Subtitle J, Sec. 7342, 102 Stat. 4469 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43) (1988)).  The Act did not include a section limiting the temporal applicability of the \"aggravated felony\" definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Appellant's drug conviction, which precipitated his deportation on October 26, 1988, falls into the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in section 1101(a)(43).  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43).  The issue in dispute is whether Congress intended for section 1326(b)(2), as it incorporates section 1101(a)(43), to apply retroactively to an alien who was convicted and deported prior to the ADAA amendments.  In Matter of A-A-, Interim Dec. 3176 (BIA 1992), the Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the plain language of the amended provisions, along with the applicability section accompanying section 1326(b), and concluded that the enhanced fifteen-year criminal penalty is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>applicable to 'any alien who enters, attempts to enter or is found in, the United States on or after the date of enactment of [the November 18, 1988] Act.'  ...  For an alien reentering the United States on November 18, 1988, to be subject to these criminal penalties, the alien would need to have suffered a conviction and deportation before November 18, 1988.  It would be virtually impossible for an alien convicted of an aggravated felony to reenter or be found in the United States on the date of enactment unless the definition of aggravated felony included convictions occurring before that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court adopted the BIA's reasoning in Barreiro v.

Forbes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), this Court upheld a conviction under section 1326(b)(2) based on aggravated felony convictions that occurred prior to the effective date of the ADAA amendments.  In oral argument, Appellant was unable to point to any case law in support of his position that section 1326(b)(2) was not intended to be applied retroactively.  Given the law of this circuit and the plain meaning of the provision, we affirm the district court's application of section 1326(b)(2) to Appellant's conviction.B. Alleged Ex Post Facto Violation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that even if Congress intended for section 1326(b)(2) to be applied retroactively, the effect of retroactive application in his situation results in a violation of the ex post facto provision of the Constitution.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3 (barring the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage a defendant).  Appellant argues that the Government failed to present evidence ruling out the possibility that he returned to the United States subsequent to his October, 1988, deportation but prior to November 18, 1988, when the ADAA amendments went into effect.  He argues that an ex post facto violation has occurred with respect to him and the class of convicted-and-deported aliens who were in the country on the date of enactment because \"such a person's status is changed, and liability thus increased, by an act, of the legislature, of which such persons had no notice, nor opportunity to avoid, even given such notice.\"   Appellant's Brief at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Forbes, this Court held that the inclusion of a defendant's prior drug convictions to trigger the enhanced criminal penalties of section 1326(b)(2) did not violate the ex post facto Clause, where the convictions had been obtained prior to the ADAA amendments.

Id. at 1302.   Appellant distinguishes his situation by pointing out that the appellant in Forbes committed the offense of unlawful reentry after the amended section went into effect, whereas Appellant may have committed the offense of unlawful reentry prior to the ADAA amendments.  But section 1326(a)(2) defines the criminal conduct more expansively to include entry, attempted reentry, or being found in the United States without permission.  Appellant was indicted and convicted of \"being found in the United States\" in violation of section 1326(b)(2).  His offense occurred on October 30, 1992, well after the ADAA amendments and not on the date of his undetected reentry.  Hence, Appellant fails to satisfy a critical element for establishing that a criminal law has ex post facto effect;  he fails to demonstrate that the law is \"retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment.\"  Weaver v.

The Court need not discuss this argument in detail because Appellant fails to satisfy threshold elements of the two estoppel doctrines.  First, with respect to \"entrapment by estoppel,\" Appellant cannot show that a government official erroneously advised him that the particular act for which he was convicted was actually legal at the time it was committed.  United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 714 (1st Cir.1991).  Second, with respect to equitable estoppel, Appellant cannot show that he relied upon a material misrepresentation, because the I.N.S. informed Appellant that he would face up to two years for unlawful reentry which was an accurate rendition of the law as it existed on the date of Appellant's deportation.  See Heckler v. Community Health Services, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, this Court has recently held that even where the I.N.S. erroneously informed a deportee of the penalty faced upon reentry, such an error is not a mitigating factor justifying a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.  U.S. v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195168\"><a href=\"/opinion/195168/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1944) (holding that, even where defendant was misinformed as to the consequences of unlawful reentry and stated that he returned in reliance on the misrepresentation, such a circumstance did not justify a downward departure where defendant made a purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct ).  Hence, Appellant's arguments regarding the two estoppel doctrines are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>D.

U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Appellant argues that his conduct in violation of section 1326(b)(2) came to light only through his arrest for selling cocaine.  Since \"he was found in this country in the process of committing that [state] offense\", Appellant argues that the offense conduct of selling cocaine should be viewed as part of the instant offense and not counted as a prior sentence.  See Trial Transcript (Aug. 30, 1993) at 29-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commentary to section 4A1.2 defines \"prior sentence\" as \"a sentence imposed prior to sentencing on the instant offense, other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2, comment.  (n.1).  Here, Appellant's state court sentence was imposed in April of 1993, prior to his August 30, 1993, sentencing on the instant offense.  Whether his conduct in selling cocaine qualifies as conduct that was part of the instant offense presents an issue of first impression in this circuit.  Other circuit courts of appeal that have considered the issue have decided the appropriate inquiry is whether the \"prior sentence\" and the instant offense involve conduct that is severable into two distinct offenses.  See, e.g., U.S. v. Beddow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578642\"><a href=\"/opinion/578642/united-states-v-stephen-martin-beddow/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1330</span></a></span>, 1338-39 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that defendant's state conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was not part of the instant federal money laundering offense, even though the concealed weapon was found at the time of defendant's arrest for attempting to carry out money laundering scheme);  U.S. v. Banashefski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557438\"><a href=\"/opinion/557438/united-states-v-kenneth-john-banashefski/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1991) (holding that defendant's state court conviction for possessing a stolen car was severable from federal offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm, even though firearm was found in car's trunk at time of defendant's arrest for state stolen vehicle charge).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the \"prior sentence\" and the instant offense are severable entails a fact-specific inquiry by the district court.  To the extent that factual issues are involved, the district court's determinations are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, and \"due deference\" is afforded to the \"application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e).  Here, the district court based its findings on the Government's arguments that the only relation between Appellant's drug selling conduct and his conduct in violating section 1326(b)(2) is that the former violation set in motion a chain of events whereby federal agents were able to trace Appellant's fingerprints to those of Radhame Troncoso and the I.N.S. then retrieved his file, which led to the determination that Appellant was in the country in violation of 1326(b)(2).  Trial Transcript at 30-31.  The Government argued there was no other connection between the conduct involved in the drug offense and the 1326(b)(2) violation especially where the state prosecutor and the United States Attorney had to prove totally different elements with respect to each offense.  Id.  Based on these arguments, the district court's determination that Appellant's sentence for selling cocaine constituted a severable offense, and a \"prior sentence\" for the purpose of computing Appellant's criminal history category, is not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (\"ADAA\"), section 1326 provided for a maximum two-year term of imprisonment for any alien who had been previously arrested and deported and was thereafter convicted of reentry, attempted reentry, or being found in the United States without permission.  8 U.S.C.

Sec. 1326(b)(2).  Counsel acknowledged that \"related cases,\" as used in the Guidelines, refers to the relationship between prior sentences and whether prior sentences should be counted as one sentence in a defendant's criminal history and does not govern a court's assessment of whether a prior sentence should be viewed as part of the instant offense.
