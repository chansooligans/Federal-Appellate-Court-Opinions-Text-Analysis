The district court\n                                        \n\naffirmed a  bankruptcy court order which  compelled a secured\n\ncreditor  to  pay to  the debtor's  estate  a portion  of the\n\nproceeds  it  had received  in  satisfaction  of its  allowed\n\nsecured claim.   The bankruptcy court's  order contravened an\n\nagreement  between  the  secured creditor  and  the  general,\n\nunsecured  creditors  to  share  in  the  proceeds  from  the\n\nformer's secured interest.   The  bankruptcy court  believed,\n\nand  the  district  court  agreed,  that  such  an  agreement\n\nviolated  Bankruptcy Code  policy.   Appellant,  the Official\n\nUnsecured Creditors' Committee which entered the agreement on\n\nbehalf of  the general, unsecured creditors,  argues that the\n\nbankruptcy court's order  to pay over  the disputed funds  to\n\nthe estate was an error of law.  We agree with appellant, and\n\nso  reverse the district court judgment,  vacate the order in\n\npart and remand to the bankruptcy court.\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n                                     \n\n          Debtor  SPM  Manufacturing  Corporation  (\"SPM\"  or\n\n\"Debtor\"), a  family-owned manufacturer  of photo albums  and\n\nrelated products based in Springfield, Massachusetts, filed a\n\nvoluntary petition for relief under  Chapter 11 of the United\n\nStates Bankruptcy  Code (\"Code\")  on  April 3,  1989, in  the\n\nUnited  States   Bankruptcy   Court  for   the  District   of\n\nMassachusetts.   See 11 U.S.C.   1101 et seq.  SPM management\n                                             \n\ncontinued to operate  the company as  a debtor in  possession\n\n(\"DIP\")  pursuant to 11 U.S.C.    1101(1) and 1107.  Appellee\n\nRobert  Shaine continued to serve as president of SPM and was\n\nan  unsecured \"insider\"  creditor.   Appellee  Frances Shaine\n\ncontinued on as  chair of the  board of SPM,  in addition  to\n\nbeing a stockholder and having responsibility for the general\n\nadministrative functions of SPM.\n\n          Appellant  Official Unsecured  Creditors' Committee\n\n(\"Committee\") was appointed by the  bankruptcy court pursuant\n\nto 11 U.S.C.   1102(a) on April 13, 1989.  When SPM filed for\n\nbankruptcy  protection, the  company owed  approximately $5.5\n\nmillion  to the  general, unsecured creditors  represented by\n\nthe  Committee,  including  International Paper  Company  and\n\nother  suppliers.1   Approximately  $9  million  was owed  to\n\nCitizens Savings  Bank (\"Citizens\"  or \"Bank\"), which  held a\n\nperfected,  first security  interest in  all of  SPM's assets\n\nexcept  certain  real  estate.    Unsecured  debts  that  had\n\npriority  under  section  507(a)  of the  Code,  11  U.S.C.  \n\n507(a), consisted  primarily of a tax  claim of approximately\n\n$750,000 held by the  Internal Revenue Service (\"I.R.S.\") for\n\nunpaid withholding taxes.   The Shaines are personally liable\n\n                    \n\n1.   For simplicity,  this opinion uses only  the approximate\nvalue  of the various claims  against the Debtor.   The exact\namounts of these claims are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                             -4-\n\nfor whatever portion of that tax claim is not paid out of the\n\nestate.2\n\n          Chapter  11  proceedings  to  reorganize  SPM  were\n\ncontentious and unproductive.   Though the  DIP filed a  plan\n\nfor  reorganization  in  September  1989,  later  amended  in\n\nNovember  1989, the plan was never  confirmed.  The Committee\n\ndecided  at about  the  same time  that reorganization  under\n\ncurrent management was unfeasible,  but that a liquidation of\n\nSPM's  assets would  leave nothing  for any  creditor besides\n\nCitizens,  whose  secured claim  exceeded  the  value of  its\n\ncollateral    (substantially    all    of   SPM's    assets).\n\nConsequently, the  Committee began discussions  with Citizens\n\nabout cooperating  in the bankruptcy proceedings  to maximize\n\nthe  value of  SPM's assets  and provide  some return  to the\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditors.  \n\n          On October  12,  1989, the  Committee and  Citizens\n\nexecuted the agreement (\"Agreement\")  which is the subject of\n\nthis appeal.  The  Agreement recites the opinion of  Citizens\n\nand the Committee that, \"through their mutual cooperation . .\n\n.  in order to maximize recovery on their respective debts it\n\nis in  their mutual interest  to enter into  this Agreement.\"\n\nThe contract explicitly states that  the Committee negotiated\n\n                    \n\n2.  Other creditors  not relevant to this  appeal are various\n\"insiders\" and Heritage Bank for Savings, which held  a valid\nfirst  mortgage  on real  estate  owned  by  SPM in  Holyoke,\nMassachusetts.\n\n                             -5-\n\nand  executed  the  Agreement   on  behalf  of  the  general,\n\nunsecured creditors,  \"[e]xclusive  of the  Internal  Revenue\n\nService and potential 'insider' creditors.\"\n\n          Citizens and the  Committee agreed to  cooperate in\n\nthe  following manner:  (1) to  \"take all  actions reasonably\n\nnecessary,  including,  without  limitation,   initiation  of\n\nmotions  and filing of other  pleadings in the Proceeding, to\n\nreplace Debtor's current CEO with  [a] New Manager\"; (2)  \"to\n\nwork together  to formulate a joint  plan of reorganization\";\n\nand (3) to \"negotiate with one another in good faith to reach\n\nmutually acceptable  agreements\" with respect to  a number of\n\ndetails of the joint plan for reorganization.\n\n          Citizens  and the  Committee also  agreed to  share\n\nwhatever  proceeds   they  received   as  a  result   of  the\n\nreorganization or liquidation of the Debtor.  Section  2.4 of\n\nthe  Agreement   specified   the  terms   of   the   \"sharing\n\narrangement\":\n\n               Any  and  all  net proceeds  of  the\n          sale, refinancing or other disposition of\n          the assets of SPM and also North American\n          Album  Corporation  or  any other  entity\n          whose  assets  are  subject to  Citizens'\n          security   interest   (net  proceeds   is\n          defined as those proceeds remaining after\n          payment of administrative expenses  as so\n          defined  by 11 U.S.C.   503, specifically\n          including  attorney's  fees and  expenses\n          incurred   by   the   Committee  and   by\n          Citizens) received by Citizens and/or the\n          Creditors'   Committee    from   Debtor's\n          operations in whatever form said proceeds\n          make [sic] take (including  proceeds from\n          the operation of  any successor  entity's\n\n                             -6-\n\n          business) or from the sale or disposition\n          of the  Debtor's or a  successor's assets\n          and/or  stock  shall  be divided  between\n          Citizens and the Creditors'  Committee as\n          follows:\n               1.  The  first  $3,000,000  of  such\n          proceeds  shall be shared 90% to Citizens\n          and 10% to  the Creditors' Committee .  .\n          .;\n               2.  The  second $3,000,000  shall be\n          shared   by   citizens   [sic]  and   the\n          Creditors'  Committee  with 80%  going to\n          Citizens  and  20%   to  the   Creditors'\n          Committee;\n               3.  The  next  $3,000,000  shall  be\n          shared  70% to  Citizens and  30%  to the\n          Creditors' Committee;\n               4.  The  next  $3,000,000  shall  be\n          shared  60% to  Citizens  and 40%  to the\n          Creditors' Committee; and\n               5.   All   proceeds  in   excess  of\n          $12,000,000  shall  go to  the Creditor's\n          Committee.\n\nThe  Agreement  contained  a standard  savings  clause  which\n\nprovided that \"[i]n the event of any term or provision hereof\n\nis invalid or unenforceable [the] remainder of this Agreement\n\nshall be  valid and  enforceable to  the extent permitted  by\n\nlaw.\"\n\n          Thereafter,  the  Committee   and  the  Bank  filed\n\nnumerous  motions,  both independently  and  jointly, seeking\n\nunsuccessfully  a  change in  SPM's  management,  a grant  of\n\nrelief from the automatic  stay for Citizens, the appointment\n\nof  a Chapter  11 trustee,  and conversion  of the  case from\n\nChapter 11  to Chapter 7.   At a  motion hearing  in December\n\n1989, the Agreement was  filed with the court as  an exhibit.\n\nThe court  expressed concern  about  the Agreement's  sharing\n\n                             -7-\n\nprovision,  characterizing it  as a  \"tax-avoidance\" scheme.3\n\nHowever, at no time during the reorganization proceedings did\n\nany creditor,  the Shaines or other  interested party4 object\n\nto  the  mutual promises  by  Citizens and  the  Committee to\n\ncooperate during the reorganization  proceedings.  The  court\n\nnever formally  approved or disapproved the  Agreement before\n\nJanuary 1991.\n\n          After  it became  apparent  that SPM  could not  be\n\nsuccessfully  reorganized,  the  bankruptcy court  granted  a\n\nmotion by Citizens on  April 16, 1990, to appoint  a receiver\n\nwith the  power to negotiate  a sale  of all of  SPM's assets\n\npursuant to 11 U.S.C.   363(b).  On December  19, 1990, SPM's\n\nassets were  sold to  Heritage  Albums, Inc.  for a  purchase\n\nprice of $5,000,000.00.   On December 21,  1990, a previously\n\nentered order went into  effect granting Citizens relief from\n\nthe automatic stay, see  11 U.S.C.   362, and  converting the\n                       \n\ncase into a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding, see 11 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n3.   When he  first saw  the Agreement, the  bankruptcy judge\nindicated that  he thought it might  violate section 1129(d),\nwhich prohibits confirmation of a reorganization plan \"if the\nprincipal purpose of the plan is the avoidance of taxes.\"  11\nU.S.C.    1129(d).   Appellees  long ago  abandoned the  tax-\navoidance argument,  probably because the Agreement  is not a\n\"plan\" requiring confirmation  within the meaning of  section\n1129  and thus  not subject  to the  requirements of  section\n1129(d).\n\n4.   Appellee  Stern  was  not  appointed as  the  Chapter  7\ntrustee until December 1990.\n\n                             -8-\n\n1112(b).   After  conversion to  Chapter 7,  appellee Trustee\n\nStern was appointed.  See 11 U.S.C.   701(a).\n                         \n\n          On December  24, 1990, the  Committee and  Citizens\n\nfiled a  joint motion for \"Entry of  Order Requiring Delivery\n\nof  Proceeds  and  Requiring  Expedited  Determination\" which\n\nrequested distribution of the sale proceeds to Citizens.  The\n\nmotion  recited  that  the   entire  amount  was  subject  to\n\nCitizens' security interest pursuant to  11 U.S.C.   506  and\n\nannounced  that, after  receiving the  $5 million  and paying\n\nvarious  administrative fees,  \"Citizens  will  distribute  a\n\nportion  of  the  net   proceeds  to  Kamberg,  Berman,  P.C.\n\n[Committee's counsel] in accordance with its October 12, 1989\n\nagreement  with  the Committee.\"    At a  hearing  before the\n\nbankruptcy  court on  January  3, 1991,  the  Debtor and  the\n\nShaines objected  to the  motion, arguing that  the Agreement\n\ndistributed proceeds to general, unsecured creditors ahead of\n\nthe  priority tax  creditors  in violation  of the  statutory\n\nscheme for distribution.  See 11 U.S.C.    724-726.  Citizens\n                             \n\nand the Committee responded  that the $5 million  belonged to\n\nCitizens and that the Bank had a right  to share its proceeds\n\nwith  the  Committee  without  paying  the  I.R.S.  or  other\n\ncreditors first.         The    bankruptcy    court   granted\n\nCitizens'  and  the  Committee's  motion  to  the  extent  it\n\nrequested satisfaction of Citizens' allowed secured claim for\n\n$5  million,  but  rejected  the  motion  to  the  extent  it\n\n                             -9-\n\nrequested  approval  of the  Agreement's  sharing provision.5\n\nThe bankruptcy  judge explained that he  viewed the Agreement\n\nas  a form of proceeds distribution which did not comply with\n\nthe Code.\n\n               I am not approving  any distribution\n          that   is  not  in  accordance  with  the\n          priority  of the  bankruptcy code,  and I\n          think I made that abundantly clear a long\n          time  ago.   I'm  not going  to have  the\n          bankruptcy code, have  an end-run  around\n          it  in  this court.    The  law sets  out\n          certain  priorities,  and your  committee\n          has  absolutely  no  authority to  short-\n          circuit  those priorities, and  I want to\n          make that clear.\n\nFurthermore,  the bankruptcy  court explained,  the Committee\n\nhas a duty to the bankruptcy estate.\n\n               I rule that the  committee, although\n          it certainly had  authority to  negotiate\n          something   for   the   benefit  of   the\n          bankruptcy  estate,  that  authority  was\n          just that, for the benefit  of the entire\n          bankruptcy estate, and the  committee had\n          no authority, never thought it had    and\n          if it  did [ask  for court  approval], it\n          would  not  have  been  given  it      to\n          negotiate  something  for the  benefit of\n          some sets of  creditors of the bankruptcy\n          estate.\n               It  is  perfectly true  that without\n          the agreement the bankruptcy estate would\n          get  nothing, but once  the committee was\n          in operation it had to, it's required  by\n\n                    \n\n5.   On  its face, the  motion by Citizens  and the Committee\ndoes not request approval of the Agreement.  However,  during\nthe motion hearing, counsel  for Citizens requested the court\nto order the Chapter 7 trustee to oversee the distribution of\nproceeds  to the  general,  unsecured creditors.   The  court\ntreated this request  as part  of the motion  and refused  to\ngrant  it.    We  consider  the  mechanics  of  the  proceeds\ndistribution infra in Part III.\n                  \n\n                             -10-\n\n          law, to act for the benefit of the entire\n          estate . . . .\n\n          In accordance  with its ruling at  the hearing, the\n\nbankruptcy court  issued a  Disbursement Order on  January 8,\n\n1991, ordering the following:\n\n          1.

After payment  of all fees,  Citizens\n          shall  compute  the  amount  due  to  the\n          Committee under the agreement  of October\n          12,   1989   between  Citizens   and  the\n          Committee.   Citizens shall then pay such\n          amount  to the  trustee in  bankruptcy of\n          SPM Manufacturing  Corporation, who shall\n          administer  the  same in  accordance with\n          the  provisions  of  the Bankruptcy  Code\n          including    the     Code's    provisions\n          concerning priority for tax claims.\n\nThe effect  of paragraph six of  the order is to  deprive the\n\ngeneral, unsecured  creditors of  any amount they  would have\n\nreceived under  the Agreement and to benefit  the I.R.S., the\n\nother priority creditors, and  the Shaines who, as principals\n\nof SPM,  would be personally  liable for  the underlying  tax\n\nobligations.\n\n          Citizens  and the Committee  made timely objections\n\nto the order and appealed to the United States District Court\n\nfor the District  of Massachusetts.   Trustee  Stern and  the\n\nShaines appeared as  appellees, and the funds were  placed in\n\nescrow pending  outcome of  the appeal.   The  district court\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court order, reasoning that it was  a\n\nproper  exercise of the  bankruptcy court's  equitable powers\n\nunder section 105(a) of the Code.  \"[T]he  Disbursement Order\n\nfurthers the  legislative distribution  scheme  in Chapter  7\n\n                             -12-\n\ncases and []  the Sharing  Agreement, in  its original  form,\n\nthwarts  that scheme.\"  The district court explained that, in\n\naccordance with the Code  and Massachusetts contract law, the\n\nbankruptcy court \"reformed\" the  Agreement to comply with the\n\ndistribution scheme of the Code.\n\n          The  Committee  filed  a  timely  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict  court's order.  The  Bank, conceding that the funds\n\nin  escrow belong either to  the Committee or  to the estate,\n\ndoes not join the  appeal.

DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The facts are essentially undisputed.  The issue on\n\nappeal is whether the  bankruptcy court erred as a  matter of\n\nlaw in ordering Citizens  to pay to the Trustee  that portion\n\nof the Bank's secured interest  which, according to the terms\n\nof the Agreement,  was due to  the Committee.   In an  appeal\n\nfrom  district court review of  a bankruptcy court order, the\n\ncourt of appeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court's\n\ndecision, applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings\n\nof  fact and  de novo review  to conclusions  of law.   In re\n                                                             \n\nLaRoche,  969 F.2d 1299, 1301  (1st Cir. 1992);  In re G.S.F.\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  938 F.2d  1467,  1474 (1st  Cir.  1991).   Where  the\n     \n\nlanguage of a contract is unambiguous, the bankruptcy court's\n\ninterpretation of  it is subject  to de  novo review.   In re\n                                                             \n\nSublett,  895 F.2d 1381, 1384  (11th Cir. 1990).   No special\n       \n\ndeference is owed to the district court's determinations.  In\n                                                             \n\nre G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d at 1474.\n               \n\n          Appellees   argue  that  the  order  was  a  proper\n\nexercise  of the  bankruptcy court's  equitable  powers under\n\nsection 105(a) of  the Code.   The bankruptcy  court has  the\n\nequitable  power \"to  issue any  order, process,  or judgment\n\nthat is necessary or appropriate to carry out provisions\"  of\n\nthe  Code.  11 U.S.C.   105(a).  However, \"whatever equitable\n\npowers remain in the  bankruptcy courts must and can  only be\n\nexercised  within  the  confines  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code.\"\n\n                             -14-\n\nNorwest Bank Worthington v.

That is,  the bankruptcy  court has  no\n\nequitable power  to deprive  creditors of rights  or remedies\n\navailable to them under the Code.  See Norwest Bank, 485 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 206-07; In re Grissom, 955 F.2d 1440,  1449 n.8 (11th Cir.\n                        \n\n1992).  Nor  does section 105(a)  authorize courts to  create\n\nsubstantive rights that  are otherwise unavailable  under the\n\nCode, or  to expand  the contractual obligations  of parties.\n\nUnited States v. Pepperman, 976 F.2d 123, 131 (3d Cir. 1992);\n                          \n\nUnited States v. Sutton, 786 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1986).  \n                       \n\n          Appellees portray the bankruptcy court's order as a\n\nmere \"reform\" of  the Agreement.   In their  view, the  court\n\nsimply substituted the bankruptcy estate for the Committee as\n\nthe  proper  beneficiary  of  the sharing  provision  of  the\n\nAgreement.     Appellant   responds  that   transferring  the\n\ncontractual  right to  receive payment  from  one party  to a\n\nthird  party goes  beyond mere  \"reform.\"   The question  now\n\nbefore us is whether  an order compelling Citizens to  pay to\n\nthe estate  from monies  realized under its  secured interest\n\nthe  amount required  by  the Agreement  to  be paid  to  the\n\nCommittee is  within the  equitable powers of  the bankruptcy\n\n                             -15-\n\ncourt.7    Because  section   105(a)  is  not  a   source  of\n\nsubstantive   rights,  the   bankruptcy  court's   order  was\n\nlegitimate only  to the extent  that some other  provision of\n\nthe  Code  or other  applicable  law entitled  the  estate to\n\nreceive the disputed funds.  See In re Morristown &amp; Erie R.R.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 885 F.2d 98, 100 (3d Cir. 1989).\n   \n\n          Appellees argue  that the  order was  authorized on\n\nthree  different  grounds:  (1)  the Agreement  attempted  to\n\ndistribute property not in accordance with the priorities and\n\ndistribution scheme of  Code sections  507 and  726; (2)  the\n\nCommittee had a duty to negotiate on behalf of all creditors,\n\nnot  just  the  general,  unsecured creditors;  and  (3)  the\n\nAgreement altered  the balance  of  power in  the Chapter  11\n\nreorganization  proceedings.    We  consider   each  argument\n\nseparately.\n\n              A. Distribution Scheme of the Code\n                                                \n\n          Appellees   argue   that   allowing  the   general,\n\nunsecured  creditors  to receive  money  under the  Agreement\n\nwhile priority tax creditors  receive nothing would  conflict\n\nwith  the statutory  scheme  for  distribution of  bankruptcy\n\nestate  property.   See 11  U.S.C.    507,  726.   Thus, they\n                       \n\n                    \n\n7.  The parties in their  briefs assume that the amount  owed\nto the  Committee under the Agreement  would be approximately\n$700,000.   However, the actual  amount could be  less due to\npayment  of   administrative  fees  and  expenses   prior  to\ndistribution of the proceeds.  This is not a matter for us to\nresolve.\n\n                             -16-\n\ncontend,  the bankruptcy  court properly  acted in  equity to\n\nprevent  a  violation  of  the  Code's  distribution  scheme.\n\nSection 726 provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n          [P]roperty   of   the  estate   shall  be\n          distributed    \n               (1)   first, in payment of claims of\n          the  kind specified in,  and in the order\n          specified in, section 507 of the title;\n               (2)  second,  in   payment  of   any\n          allowed  unsecured  claim,  other than  a\n          claim  of a  kind specified  in paragraph\n          (1),  (3),  or  (4)  of  this subsection,\n          proof of which is [timely filed.]\n\n11 U.S.C.   726(a).  Section 507 of the Code identifies those\n\nexpenses and  claims which  have priority over  other claims,\n\nincluding  administrative  expenses  allowed   under  section\n\n503(b), claims for wages,  and unsecured tax claims.   See 11\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   507(a)(1), (3), (7).\n\n          However,  the  distribution scheme  of  section 726\n\n(and, by implication, the priorities of section 507) does not\n\ncome  into play  until all  valid liens  on the  property are\n\nsatisfied.   See United States  v. Speers, 382  U.S. 266, 269\n                                         \n\nn.3 (1965); Goggin v. Division  of Labor Law Enforcement, 336\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 118,  126-127 (1949).   If a  lien is perfected  and not\n\notherwise invalidated by law, it must be satisfied out of the\n\nassets  it encumbers before  any proceeds  of the  assets are\n\navailable  to  unsecured  claimants, including  those  having\n\npriority (such as  priority tax creditors).   In re  Darnell,\n                                                            \n\n834  F.2d 1263, 1265 (6th Cir. 1987).   Citizens held a valid\n\nlien on  all  of the  SPM  assets;  these were  sold  for  $5\n\n                             -17-\n\nmillion.    The bankruptcy  court  allowed  Citizens' secured\n\nclaim in that amount.   Clearly, then, absent the  order, the\n\nentire $5 million belonged to Citizens in satisfaction of its\n\nlien,  leaving nothing  for the estate  to distribute  to the\n\nother creditors, including the I.R.S.  The bankruptcy court's\n\norder  forced Citizens to transfer to the estate a portion of\n\nits own $5 million notwithstanding the court's recognition of\n\nCitizens' right to receive that sum in full.\n\n          Because  Citizens' secured  claim  absorbed all  of\n\nSPM's assets, there was  nothing left for any  other creditor\n\nin  this  case.    Ordinarily,  in  such  circumstances,  the\n\ndistributional priorities of sections  726 and 507 would have\n\nbeen  mooted.   Appellees  defend  the outcome  below  on the\n\nground that the Agreement improperly syphoned proceeds to the\n\ngeneral,  unsecured  creditors \"at  the  expense  of priority\n\ncreditors.\"   However,  it is  hard to  see how  the priority\n\ncreditors lost anything owed them given the  fact there would\n\nhave been nothing left  for the priority creditors after  the\n\n$5 million was distributed  to Citizens.  The  \"syphoning\" of\n\nthe money to general,  unsecured creditors came entirely from\n\nthe  $5 million belonging to  Citizens, to which  no one else\n\nhad any claim of right under the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          Appellees point to the Agreement's  sharing formula\n\nand ask  how the parties  could contemplate sharing  over $12\n\nmillion  when Citizens' claim was worth only $9 million.  The\n\n                             -18-\n\nAgreement,  it  is  said,  could   not  contemplate  dividing\n\nproperty  that did not belong to the parties to the contract.\n\nBut  appellees' assertion  is based  on a  misreading of  the\n\nAgreement.  The Agreement merely states that Citizens and the\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditors will pool whatever they received\n                                                             \n\nfrom  the bankruptcy  estate (either  in a  reorganization or\n\nliquidation)  and will  then  divide the  pooled funds  among\n\nthemselves.   Any sharing  between Citizens and  the general,\n\nunsecured creditors  was to  occur after distribution  of the\n                                        \n\nestate property, having no  effect whatever on the bankruptcy\n\ndistributions to other creditors.\n\n          This crucial  fact remains true under any scenario.\n\nWhen the Agreement was signed in October 1989, the value of a\n\nreorganized  or  liquidated  SPM   was  unknown.    Assume  a\n\nliquidation would have produced  $15 million after payment of\n\nthe various  administrative expenses.  If  that had happened,\n\nthe  first  $9  million  would  have  gone   to  Citizens  in\n\nsatisfaction of its  lien, and  the rest of  the money  would\n\nhave been  distributed pursuant to section  726 (assuming the\n\ncase  had already been converted  to Chapter 7).   Hence, the\n\nnext $800,000 or so would have been distributed to the I.R.S.\n\nand other priority creditors,  and the remaining $5.2 million\n\nwould  have  gone  to  the general,  unsecured  creditors  in\n\nvirtual  satisfaction of  their  $5.5 million  claim, leaving\n\nnothing for \"insiders\" and  other subordinated creditors.  By\n\n                             -19-\n\nits  terms, the sharing formula  in the Agreement  is to take\n\neffect  only  after a  proper  distribution  under the  Code.\n\nCitizens and the  Committee would have pooled  only their own\n\nbankruptcy dividends   for a combined $14.2  million and then\n\nsplit  this  sum  according   to  the  Agreement's   formula.\n\nDistributions  to the  I.R.S. and  all other  creditors under\n\nsection   726  would  be  unaffected.     Under  any  set  of\n\nassumptions, then, the Agreement does not distribute property\n\nof the estate \"at the expense of\" priority creditors nor does\n\nit  violate  the distribution  scheme of  section 726  or the\n\npriorities of section 507.  \n\n          Appellees  argue,  in  the  alternative,  that  the\n\nAgreement   conflicts  with   the   spirit   of  the   Code's\n\ndistribution  scheme, under  which priority  creditors always\n\nget paid in full  before general, unsecured creditors receive\n\nanything.    Appellees  contend  that  Congress never  wanted\n\nunsecured  creditors     especially creditors  represented by\n\nthe  official   creditors'  committee       to  be   able  to\n\n\"circumvent\"   this  scheme   by  negotiating   with  secured\n\ncreditors to  increase the  return received for  their claims\n\nagainst the debtor.   Appellees' theory, however, goes beyond\n\nanything appearing  expressly or by implication  in the Code.\n\nSection   726  and  the   other  Code   provisions  governing\n\npriorities  of  creditors  apply  only  to  distributions  of\n\nproperty of the estate.  The  Code does not govern the rights\n\n                             -20-\n\nof  creditors  to  transfer  or receive  nonestate  property.\n\nWhile  the  debtor and  the trustee  are  not allowed  to pay\n\nnonpriority creditors  ahead of priority  creditors, see King\n                                                             \n\nv.  United  States,  379   U.S.  329  (1964),  creditors  are\n                  \n\ngenerally free to  do whatever they wish  with the bankruptcy\n\ndividends they  receive, including  to share them  with other\n\ncreditors.   Cf. In re  Allegheny Int'l, Inc.,  100 B.R. 241,\n                                             \n\n243 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1988) (remarking that the Code \"does not\n\npermit a debtor to  pay its pre-petition debts to  suppliers,\n\nat a discount or otherwise, before  confirmation of the plan,\n\nbut  it appears to allow third parties to purchase the claims\n\nof those suppliers\").\n\n          In  this case,  the proceeds of  the sale  of SPM's\n\nassets  pursuant  to 11  U.S.C.    363  were property  of the\n\nestate and thus the Code governed their use and distribution.\n\nHowever, once the court lifted the automatic stay and ordered\n\nthose proceeds distributed to Citizens in proper satisfaction\n\nof  its lien, that money became the property of Citizens, not\n\nof the estate.   Appellees concede that the  bankruptcy court\n\nhas  no authority  to control  how  Citizens disposes  of the\n\nproceeds once it receives them.  There is nothing in the Code\n\nforbidding Citizens  to have  voluntarily paid part  of these\n\nmonies to  some or  all of  the general,  unsecured creditors\n\nafter the bankruptcy proceedings finished.\n\n                             -21-\n\n          Thus,  appellees'  argument  reduces to  contending\n\nthat although  a  secured  creditor  is  free  to  share  its\n\nproceeds   with   nonpriority   creditors  after   bankruptcy\n\nproceedings have concluded, it may not enter into a  contract\n\nduring  bankruptcy in which it promises to do the same thing.\n      \n\nAgain,  appellees' argument  lacks statutory  support for  it\n\nconfuses  estate  property  and   nonestate  property.    The\n\nparties' agreement to share  the proceeds could be seen  as a\n\npartial assignment  by  Citizens and  the general,  unsecured\n\ncreditors of  their rights to  receive bankruptcy dividends.8\n\nSee  David  Gray  Carlson,   A  Theory  of  Contractual  Debt\n                                                             \n\nSubordination and Lien  Priority, 38 Vand.

The Agreement did not affect estate property, i.e., the\n\nsale  proceeds,  but only  concerned the  contacting parties'\n\nclaims against the estate,  i.e., their rights to be  paid by\n      \n\n                    \n\n8.   We do not decide exactly how to categorize the Agreement\nbecause that issue  is not  necessary to our  decision.   See\n                                                             \ninfra note 13.\n     \n\n                             -22-\n\nthe estate.  We find no support in the Code  for banning this\n\ntype of contractual assignment in all cases.\n\n          Appellees suggest  the policy of the  Code is that,\n\nregardless   of  the  source  of  the  payments,  nonpriority\n\ncreditors should  never receive a  return on their  claims if\n\npriority  creditors receive  nothing.   This  theory of  Code\n\npolicy is directly contradicted  by the fact that nonpriority\n\ncreditors   routinely receive payment from  third parties for\n\ntheir  claims without interference  by the  bankruptcy court.\n\nUnsecured creditors often sell their claims to third parties,\n\ne.g.,  for 30  cents on  the dollar,  in order  to avoid  the\n\nuncertainty and  delay of bankruptcy proceedings.

The Code does not speak to the validity of claim\n\ntransfers,  and the Bankruptcy  Rules provide only procedures\n\nfor  the filing  of notice  required for  a transferee  to be\n\nrecognized  as  the holder  of the  claim.   See  Bankr.

Bankruptcy  Rule 3001(e)(2) sets  out the  procedures for\ntransfers of claims  other than for  security after proof  of\nthe claim is filed:\n\n            If a  claim other  than one based  on a\n          publicly traded note, bond,  or debenture\n          has  been  transferred  other   than  for\n          security  after  the proof  of  claim has\n          been  filed,  evidence  of  the  transfer\n          shall be  filed by the  transferee.   The\n          clerk   shall   immediately  notify   the\n\n                             -23-\n\n(Bankr. N.D.

If\n          the  alleged  transferor  files a  timely\n          objection  and  the  court  finds,  after\n          notice and a hearing, that the claim  has\n          been transferred other than for security,\n          it shall enter  an order substituting the\n          transferee  for  the  transferor.    If a\n          timely  objection is  not  filed  by  the\n          alleged transferor,  the transferee shall\n          be substituted for the transferor.\n\nBankr.Rule 3001(e)(2).\n          Prior to 1991, some courts interpreted Rule 3001 as\nauthorization  for courts  \"to  monitor the  manner in  which\nclaims are transferred or assigned and thereby prevent, inter\nalia,  the improper proliferation  of claims,  wrongdoing and\ninequitable conduct.\"  In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., 119 B.R.\n                                                   \n440, 443 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1990).  Rule 3001(e) was amended in\n1991  to restrict the bankruptcy court's power to inspect the\nterms of such transfers.   See In re  Odd Lot Trading,  Inc.,\n                                                            \n115 B.R. 97, 100-01  (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1990).   Transfers are\nno longer required to be  unconditional and assignees do  not\nhave  to  submit to  the bankruptcy  court  the terms  of the\ntransfer for  its approval.  Consequently,  under the amended\nrule,  the bankruptcy  court  cannot disapprove  the transfer\nbecause of  its terms,  e.g., inadequate consideration.   The\n1991 Advisory Committee Note explains that:\n\n            Subdivision (e) is amended to limit the\n          court's  role  to  the   adjudication  of\n          disputes   regarding   the  transfer   of\n          claims.  .  .  .  If  a  claim  has  been\n          transferred other than for security after\n          a  proof  of claim  has  been filed,  the\n          transferee   is   substituted   for   the\n          transferor.   In  that  event, the  clerk\n          should note the transfer without the need\n          for   court  approval.     If   a  timely\n          objection is  filed, the court's  role is\n          to determine whether a transfer  has been\n          made    that    is   enforceable    under\n          nonbankruptcy  law.    This rule  is  not\n          intended    either   to    encourage   or\n          discourage   postpetition   transfers  of\n          claims . . . .\n\nBankr. Rule 3001, Advisory Committee Notes, 1991 Amendment.\n\n                             -24-\n\n19-25.    The circumstances  in  which  claims transfers  are\n\nexpressly said to be  invalid are limited.  For  example, the\n\npurchasing of claims by an affiliate or insider of the debtor\n\nfor  the  sole  purpose   of  blocking  the  confirmation  of\n\ncompeting plans  may constitute \"bad faith\"  for the purposes\n\nof section 1126(e), 11 U.S.C.   1126(e).  See In re Applegate\n                                                             \n\nProperty, Ltd., 133 B.R. 827, 834-35 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1991).\n              \n\nAn assigned claim may be limited if the assignment involves a\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty or  fraud and the breach of duty  or\n\nfraud  enables   the  assignee  to  acquire   the  claim  for\n\ninadequate  consideration.   In re Executive  Office Centers,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  96 B.R.  642, 649  (Bankr. E.D.  La. 1988).   However,\n    \n\nabsent  some effect  on the administration  of the  estate or\n\ndiminution of estate property, neither the Code nor the Rules\n\nprohibit  or  discourage creditors  from receiving  cash from\n\nnondebtors in exchange for their claims.\n\n          While  the  Agreement in  this  case  might not  be\n\ncategorized   as  a  \"transfer\"  under  Rule  3001(e),10  the\n\n                    \n\n10.  We  do  not decide  whether the  Agreement in  this case\nconstitutes a \"transfer\" of claim subject to the requirements\nof  Rule 3001  because appellees  did  not raise  this issue.\nEven if notice of the Agreement should  have been but was not\nfiled with  the court, that  failure would not  authorize the\nbankruptcy  court to void or alter the Agreement.  Failure to\nfile notice of a transfer under Rule 3001(e) only affects the\nstanding  of the transferee as a \"creditor\" and thus the duty\nof   the  trustee  to  make  payment  on  the  claim  to  the\ntransferee. See Bankr.  Rule 3001(e);  In re  FRG, Inc.,  124\n                                                       \nB.R. 653, 656-57 (Bankr.  E.D.

Pa.\n                      \n1988).\n\n                             -25-\n\nfinancial outcomes produced by  the Agreement and by outright\n\nclaim  transfers are  analogous.   If the  general, unsecured\n\ncreditors  in this case had sold their claims to Citizens (or\n\nanother third party)  for cash,  e.g., for ten  cents on  the\n\ndollar, after  all was said  and done the  priority creditors\n\nwould  have  received  nothing  and  the  general,  unsecured\n\ncreditors would have received  approximately $550,000 (10% of\n\ntheir $5.5 million total claim).  The  bankruptcy court would\n\nhave  had  no authority  to  prevent  the general,  unsecured\n\ncreditors  from transferring  their  claims.   In comparison,\n\nunder  the  Agreement's  sharing  arrangement   the  general,\n\nunsecured  creditors   would  receive,  under   the  parties'\n\ncalculations, see note 7, approximately $700,000 (about 12.5%\n                 \n\nof their  claims) while  priority creditors  receive nothing.\n\nGiven authority  in the Bankruptcy  Code and Rules  to permit\n\noutright  transfers resulting in general, unsecured creditors\n\nreceiving some  money  for their  claims, we  see nothing  to\n\nprohibit the  same result if produced by a partial assignment\n\nor sharing of claims such as accomplished by the Agreement in\n\nthis case.\n\n          Because  Code  provisions governing  priorities and\n\ndistribution of  estate property gave the estate  no right to\n\nshare   in  proceeds  from   Citizens'  secured   claim,  the\n\nbankruptcy court derived no right under those same provisions\n\n                             -26-\n\nto order Citizens to pay a portion of its  own claim proceeds\n\nto the estate.\n\n              B. No Fiduciary Duty to the Estate\n                                                \n\n          Appellees argue that  the bankruptcy court  had the\n\nequitable  power to order Citizens  to pay to  the estate the\n\namount  due to the Committee under  the Agreement because, as\n\nthe bankruptcy court ruled:\n\n          [T]he  committee,  although it  certainly\n          had authority to negotiate  something for\n          the  benefit  of  the bankruptcy  estate,\n          that authority  was  just that,  for  the\n          benefit of the entire  bankruptcy estate,\n          and the committee had  no authority . . .\n          to negotiate something for the benefit of\n          some  sets of creditors of the bankruptcy\n          estate.\n\nAppellees do  not contest the bankruptcy  court's ruling that\n\nthe  Committee had the general power to enter contracts.  The\n\nCode expressly authorizes a  committee to \"perform such other\n\nservices  as are in the  interest of those  represented.\"  11\n\nU.S.C.     1103(c)(5).    Appellees  also  concede  that  the\n\nCommittee's appointment  pursuant  to  11  U.S.C.     1102(a)\n\ncharged it only with representation of the general, unsecured\n\ncreditors  (not with  representation of  the I.R.S.  or other\n\npriority  creditors).     Nevertheless,  they   contend,  any\n\nagreement  negotiated  by  the  Committee  should  have  been\n\nnegotiated  to benefit  the estate  as a  whole and  thus any\n\ncontractual right to receive payment from Citizens rightfully\n\nbelongs to the estate.\n\n                             -27-\n\n          We do not accept this contention, as it seems based\n\non  the  erroneous  assumption  that  the Official  Unsecured\n\nCreditors'  Committee is  a  fiduciary for  the  estate as  a\n\nwhole.  While a creditors' committee and its members must act\n\nin accordance with the provisions  of the Bankruptcy Code and\n\nwith proper regard for the bankruptcy court, the committee is\n\na  fiduciary for those whom it represents, not for the debtor\n\nor the estate generally.

Fla. 1991).\n\n          In this  case, the Committee  reasonably determined\n\nthat  entering into  the Agreement with  Citizens was  in the\n\nbest  interests of  the  class it  represented,  to wit,  the\n                                                       \n\ngeneral, unsecured creditors.

The contrary appears true.  Although  the Shaines\n\nand the  Debtor may have  preferred a less  active committee,\n\nand  one more  sympathetic to  them, an  effective creditors'\n\ncommittee  must sometimes be adversarial  if it is to fulfill\n\nits role  in a Chapter 11 case.  In re Seaescape Cruises, 131\n                                                        \n\nB.R. at  243; In  re Daig  Corp., 17 B.R.  41, 43  (Bankr. D.\n                                \n\nMinn. 1981).\n\n          The creditors' committee is not  merely a\n          conduit through whom the debtor speaks to\n          and negotiates  with creditors generally.\n          On the contrary, it is purposely intended\n          to  represent  the necessarily  different\n          interests and concerns  of the  creditors\n          it  represents.   It must  necessarily be\n          adversarial  in  a   sense,  though   its\n          relation   with   the   debtor   may   be\n          supportive and friendly.  There is simply\n          no other entity  established by the  Code\n          to guard those  interests.  The committee\n          as the sum of its members is not intended\n          to be  merely an  arbiter but  a partisan\n          which will  aid, assist, and  monitor the\n          debtor pursuant to its own self-interest.\n\nIn re  Daig Corp., 17  B.R. at  43.  We  conclude, therefore,\n                 \n\nthat the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law insofar as\n\nit felt that  the Committee  was under a  particular duty  to\n\nnegotiate  the sharing  provision  of the  Agreement for  the\n\nbenefit of the estate as a whole.\n\n      C. Balance of Power in Reorganization Proceedings\n                                                       \n\n                             -29-\n\n          Appellees contend that the bankruptcy court's order\n\nequitably  prevented Citizens and  the Committee from forming\n\nan  alliance  which  would  destroy the  \"balance  of  power\"\n\nallegedly created  by the  Code, especially sections  507 and\n\n1129.   The  Agreement  between Citizens  and the  Committee,\n\nappellees argue, frustrated SPM's attempts to reorganize and,\n\nif similar  agreements are  permitted in future  cases, could\n\ncreate  \"chaos\"  and   \"free  for  alls\"  in   reorganization\n\nproceedings.\n\n          The first  part of appellees' argument     that the\n\nAgreement  actually prevented  the Debtor  in this  case from\n\nsuccessfully reorganizing    was  not timely raised below and\n\nwe do  not, therefore, consider it.  Issues not raised in the\n\nbankruptcy court are ordinarily  not considered for the first\n\ntime on appeal.

This principle  applies to cases\n\nwhere,  as  here, a  party attempts  to justify  a bankruptcy\n\ncourt  order with a theory not raised before or considered by\n\nthe bankruptcy court.   In  re Sun Runner  Marine, Inc.,  945\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1089, 1095 (9th Cir. 1991).   Though the Shaines knew of\n\nthe Agreement's  existence  since December  1989, they  never\n\ncomplained to  the bankruptcy  court about Citizens'  and the\n\nCommittee's  joining  of  forces  during  the  reorganization\n\n                             -30-\n\nproceedings;   they   raised   questions   only   about   the\n\ndistribution of Citizens' proceeds to  nonpriority creditors.\n\nThe bankruptcy court  gave no indication in  its findings and\n\nrulings that it was bothered by that aspect of the Agreement.\n\nNot until oral argument before  the district court hearing on\n\nthis appeal  did  the  Shaines  and the  Trustee  invoke  the\n\nalleged negative  effects on reorganization of  the Citizens-\n\nCommittee alliance.  \n\n          It  is  true  that,  in the  interest  of  justice,\n\nparties are sometimes permitted to offer unraised alternative\n\nrationales  for  affirming a  judgment.

But\n         \n\nappellees' contention  here that the Agreement  disrupted the\n\nDebtor's reorganization proceedings is essentially  a factual\n\nissue requiring  findings of fact  not now  contained in  the\n\nrecord before  us.   The bankruptcy  court, not the  district\n\ncourt or court of  appeals, is the only tribunal  equipped to\n\nmake evidentiary findings on relevant factual matters such as\n\nwhether the parties acted  in bad faith, whether  the parties\n\nintended to frustrate attempts  to reorganize the Debtor, and\n\nwhether the  parties' actions  actually prevented  the Debtor\n\nfrom successfully reorganizing.   See Bankruptcy Rules  7052,\n                                     \n\n8013; In re Sublett, 895 F.2d at 1384.  We are in no position\n                   \n\nto  ascertain by  ourselves whether  the Agreement,  in fact,\n\ninterfered unjustifiably with the reorganization proceedings.\n\n                             -31-\n\nSee In re  Sun Runner Marine,  945 F.2d at  1095 (\"We do  not\n                            \n\nknow  what legal  standard  the bankruptcy  court would  have\n\napplied,  or whether  the bankruptcy  court would  have found\n\nfacts warranting  [the parties'  requested  order], had  that\n\nissue been presented to it.\")\n\n          We respond  briefly to  appellees' warning  that if\n\nthis  agreement stands,  creditors  in the  future will  form\n\nalliances  to  defeat attempts  to reorganize,  extort higher\n\npayouts from  debtors, and generally create  chaos in Chapter\n\n11.  Our  focus is  necessarily on  the particular  agreement\n\nbefore   us,   to  see   whether   it   conflicts  with   the\n\nreorganization  provisions of  Chapter  11  and  whether  the\n\nrecord supports  appellees' portrait  of the dire  effects of\n\ngiving effect to such a contract.  Insofar as we can see, the\n\nparties'  promises made  in  the Agreement  were well  within\n\ntheir  rights under the Bankruptcy  Code: they agreed to move\n\nthe  bankruptcy   court  to  replace   the  Debtor's  current\n\nmanagement,  see 11  U.S.C.    1104(a),(b), and to  propose a\n                \n\nplan  of reorganization, see 11 U.S.C.   1121(c).  The record\n                            \n\nshows  that, in addition to the joint motions contemplated by\n\nthe Agreement, the  parties moved for conversion  of the case\n\nto  Chapter 7.    This  action was  allowed  by  11 U.S.C.   \n\n1112(b).  We see no indication in the Agreement that Citizens\n\nand  the  Committee  agreed  to  vote  for  or   against  any\n\nparticular plans, a restriction  which could raise charges of\n\n                             -32-\n\nbad faith.  See 11 U.S.C.   1126(e); Young v. Higbee Co., 324\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 204, 210-11 (1945).   Appellees have not pointed  to any\n\nother Code  provision implicated by  the parties' cooperative\n\nefforts.    Looking at  the  ones mentioned,  we  cannot find\n\nsupport   for  appellees'   assertion  that   this  agreement\n\nconflicts  with  any  policy   in  favor  of  reorganizations\n\nmanifested by Chapter 11.\n\n          As for  future cases,  we note that  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  always retains  the power  to monitor and  control the\n\ntenor  of  reorganization  proceedings.    If  the  unsecured\n\ncreditors' committee fails to  be properly  representative of\n\nthe unsecured  creditors, any party  in interest can  move to\n\nhave  the   committee  reconstituted.     See  11   U.S.C.   \n                                             \n\n1102(a)(2); In  re Daig Corp., 17 B.R. at 42.  If an entity's\n\n                             \n\nacceptance or rejection of a plan is not made in  good faith,\n\nor was not solicited or procured in good faith, the court can\n\ndisqualify that vote.   See 11  U.S.C.    1126(e).  The  good\n                           \n\nfaith requirement  bars creditors  from  casting their  votes\n\nfrom ulterior motives, such as coercing a higher payment from\n\nthe debtor's estate, pure malice, and advancing the interests\n\nof a competing business.  In re Federal Support Co., 859 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n17, 19 (4th Cir. 1988).  The record contains no evidence that\n\nCitizens  and  the  Committee  harbored  any   such  sinister\n\ndesigns.\n\n                             -33-\n\n          Appellees  assert  that  creditors  should  not  do\n\nanything to  alter the usual divergence  of interests between\n\nsecured  and unsecured  creditors.   While  secured creditors\n\nmight  generally prefer  liquidation and  unsecured creditors\n\nmight generally  support reorganization, the Code surely does\n\nnot  require them to take  such positions.   No two creditors\n\nhave identical  interests, see  In re  Microboard Processing,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 95 B.R. at 285, and the Code implicitly recognizes that\n    \n\nfact  by providing  a procedural  framework for  handling the\n\nvarious divergent  interests of the parties  to a bankruptcy.\n\nSee Elizabeth Warren,  Bankruptcy Policy, 54 U. Chi.  L. Rev.\n                                        \n\n775, 785-89 (1987); see also  Elizabeth Warren &amp; Jay Lawrence\n                            \n\nWestbrook, The Law  of Debtors and  Creditors 427-35 (2d  ed.\n                                             \n\n1991).  While unsecured  creditors may sometimes share common\n\nobjectives with  the debtor and current  management, they are\n\nnot  required to rubber stamp the proposals of the debtor nor\n\nto  support the retention of  current management.   See In re\n                                                             \n\nFederal Support Co.,  859 F.2d at 19 (\"It  is well settled []\n                   \n\nthat good faith  in casting  a vote does  not require of  the\n\ncreditor a selfless disinterest.\")  The duty of the unsecured\n\ncreditors'  committee to  pursue  the best  interests of  the\n\nunsecured  creditors requires different outcomes in different\n\nsituations,  and  may  entail  entering  contracts  regarding\n\nreorganization plans,  see, e.g.,  In re Donlevy's  Inc., 111\n                                                        \n\nB.R. 1, 2 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1990), recommending rejection of a\n\n                             -34-\n\ndebtor's plan of reorganization, or filing motions to convert\n\na Chapter  11 case to Chapter  7, see, e.g.,  In re Seaescape\n                                                             \n\nCruises, Ltd., 131 B.R.  at 243.  For the  reasons discussed,\n             \n\nwe  do  not  think  that  the  bankruptcy  court's  order was\n\njustified as a means to enforce the rules or policies spelled\n\nout in Chapter 11.11\n\n                      D. Other Arguments\n                                        \n\n          We briefly dispose of the parties' other arguments.\n\nWe reject  appellees' argument that Citizens,  by agreeing to\n\nshare  some of  its bankruptcy  proceeds with  the Committee,\n\n\"carved  out\" or \"divested itself\"  of a portion  of its lien\n\nand  thus the  court  \"simply used  its  equitable powers  to\n\ndetermine who best  was entitled to  receive this carved  out\n\nportion\"  of Citizens'  claim.   This  argument is  untenable\n\nbecause  no  appeal was  taken  from  the bankruptcy  court's\n\nexpress  ruling that  Citizens,  pursuant to  its $5  million\n\nallowed  secured claim,  was entitled  to receive  the entire\n\nsale proceeds.  Furthermore,  under Massachusetts law a valid\n\nassignment  of  a  debt does  not  divest  the  claim of  its\n\npriority  or alter the  debtor's obligation to  pay the debt;\n\n                    \n\n11.  Even,  indeed, if an  alliance of the  type reflected in\nthe   Agreement  were   believed  to   contravene  bankruptcy\npolicies, the remedy     ordering Citizens to pay out  to the\nestate funds it  had agreed to pay to the  Committee    would\nseem questionable.  If  the Agreement violated public policy,\nthe  more usual  remedy would  be to  declare it  invalid and\nunenforceable  rather than  to enforce  it, out  of Citizens'\npocket, in favor of a nonparty  to the Agreement. \n\n                             -35-\n\nthe assignee steps  into the  shoes of the  assignor for  the\n\nportion  of  the claim  assigned.12   See  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\n                                         \n\n106,    9-302(2); Grise v.  White, 355 Mass.  698, 247 N.E.2d\n                                 \n\n385, 388 (1969).\n\n          Because  the  bankruptcy  court's order  compelling\n\nCitizens  to pay the estate from the proceeds of its security\n\ninterest was not  authorized by section  105(a), we need  not\n\nconsider  the  Committee's argument  that section  510(a), 11\n\nU.S.C.   510(a), required the bankruptcy court to give effect\n\nto  the  Agreement  as  a  subordination  agreement.13    And\n\nbecause   the  Agreement   did  not  conflict   with  federal\n\nbankruptcy policy, there  is no need to  resolve the parties'\n\ndispute  as  to when  and to  what  extent courts  may, under\n\nMassachusetts  law,  reform  contracts  which  violate public\n\npolicy.\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n12.  We assume, for the moment,  that the Agreement could  be\ncharacterized as a partial assignment of the parties' claims.\nAs  explained infra note 13, the issue of how to characterize\n                   \nthe Agreement is not before us.\n\n13.  How to  categorize the Agreement is  no simple question.\nIt  has  attributes  of  both  a  partial  assignment  and  a\nsubordination agreement.  See generally David Gray Carlson, A\n                                                             \nTheory of  Contractual Debt Subordination  and Lien Priority,\n                                                            \n38 Vand.  L. Rev. 975 (1985)  (discussing the characteristics\nof and  enforceability of various types  of subordination and\nassignment agreements in bankruptcy).   Even if it cannot  be\ndeemed a  subordination agreement for purposes of enforcement\npursuant to 11 U.S.C.   510(a), the question on appeal is not\nwhether the  Agreement is valid and  enforceable, but whether\nthe  bankruptcy court had  authority under the  Code to issue\nits order. \n\n                             -36-\n\n          For the  reasons discussed above, we  hold that the\n\nbankruptcy court  erred  as  a  matter  of  law  in  ordering\n\nCitizens  to pay  to  the  Trustee  the  amount  due  to  the\n\nCommittee under  the Agreement.  Accordingly,  we reverse the\n\njudgment of  the district court  and vacate paragraph  six of\n\nthe bankruptcy court's Disbursement Order of January 8, 1991.\n\n          No question is raised in this appeal  as to whether\n\nthe  Agreement  is binding  on  Citizens  and the  Committee.\n\nIndeed, Citizens previously expressed, at hearings before the\n\nbankruptcy   court  and  the  district  court,  its  complete\n\nwillingness to abide by its obligation under the Agreement to\n\npay the  Committee the agreed share of the sale proceeds.  At\n\nthe  hearing  on  January   3,  1991,  counsel  for  Citizens\n\nrequested the court to order the Chapter 7 Trustee to oversee\n\nthe distribution  of the  proceeds to the  general, unsecured\n\ncreditors.  Appellees Robert and Frances Shaine  point out in\n\ntheir  appellate  brief that  the  mechanics of  distributing\n\nthese proceeds  to the general, unsecured  creditors were not\n\nmade clear  in the  Agreement, nor did  the bankruptcy  court\n\ndecide how the proceeds should be handled.\n\n          Consequently,   having   reversed  the   bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order, we remand to the bankruptcy court to determine\n\nwhether  to  allow  Citizens'  motion  to  have  the  Trustee\n\nadminister the distribution  of the funds due to the general,\n\n                             -37-\n\nunsecured creditors  under the Agreement.   Appellant has not\n\npointed to any basis  in the Code for authorizing,  let alone\n\nrequiring, the  bankruptcy court  or Trustee to  administer a\n\ndistribution   of  nonestate  funds  pursuant  to  a  private\n\nagreement.   However, because we  lack a complete  record and\n\nbecause the precise issue was not appealed, we leave it up to\n\nthe  bankruptcy  court  to  decide, in  the  first  instance,\n\nwhether  to  order  the  Trustee (rather  than  Citizens)  to\n\nadminister the distribution, and to determine  the allocation\n\nof any  related administrative  expenses.  If  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  determines  that   the  Trustee  should   not  oversee\n\ndistribution,  or if  Citizens withdraws  its motion  for the\n\nTrustee to  administer the  funds, then the  bankruptcy court\n\nshall  distribute  the  funds in  escrow,  including  accrued\n\ninterest, to Citizens  subject to  any proper  administrative\n\ncharges or other obligations.\n\n          The  district  court  judgment  is   reversed,  the\n                                                             \n\nbankruptcy  court order is vacated in part, and the matter is\n                                                             \n\nremanded for  further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. \n                                                            \n\nCosts to appellant. \n                  \n\n                             -38-\n",

The district court\n                                        \n\naffirmed a  bankruptcy court order which  compelled a secured\n\ncreditor  to  pay to  the debtor's  estate  a portion  of the\n\nproceeds  it  had received  in  satisfaction  of its  allowed\n\nsecured claim.   The bankruptcy court's  order contravened an\n\nagreement  between  the  secured creditor  and  the  general,\n\nunsecured  creditors  to  share  in  the  proceeds  from  the\n\nformer's secured interest.   The  bankruptcy court  believed,\n\nand  the  district  court  agreed,  that  such  an  agreement\n\nviolated  Bankruptcy Code  policy.   Appellant,  the Official\n\nUnsecured Creditors' Committee which entered the agreement on\n\nbehalf of  the general, unsecured creditors,  argues that the\n\nbankruptcy court's order  to pay over  the disputed funds  to\n\nthe estate was an error of law.  We agree with appellant, and\n\nso  reverse the district court judgment,  vacate the order in\n\npart and remand to the bankruptcy court.\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n                                     \n\n          Debtor  SPM  Manufacturing  Corporation  (\"SPM\"  or\n\n\"Debtor\"), a  family-owned manufacturer  of photo albums  and\n\nrelated products based in Springfield, Massachusetts, filed a\n\nvoluntary petition for relief under  Chapter 11 of the United\n\nStates Bankruptcy  Code (\"Code\")  on  April 3,  1989, in  the\n\nUnited  States   Bankruptcy   Court  for   the  District   of\n\nMassachusetts.   See 11 U.S.C.   1101 et seq.  SPM management\n                                             \n\ncontinued to operate  the company as  a debtor in  possession\n\n(\"DIP\")  pursuant to 11 U.S.C.    1101(1) and 1107.  Appellee\n\nRobert  Shaine continued to serve as president of SPM and was\n\nan  unsecured \"insider\"  creditor.   Appellee  Frances Shaine\n\ncontinued on as  chair of the  board of SPM,  in addition  to\n\nbeing a stockholder and having responsibility for the general\n\nadministrative functions of SPM.\n\n          Appellant  Official Unsecured  Creditors' Committee\n\n(\"Committee\") was appointed by the  bankruptcy court pursuant\n\nto 11 U.S.C.   1102(a) on April 13, 1989.  When SPM filed for\n\nbankruptcy  protection, the  company owed  approximately $5.5\n\nmillion  to the  general, unsecured creditors  represented by\n\nthe  Committee,  including  International Paper  Company  and\n\nother  suppliers.1   Approximately  $9  million  was owed  to\n\nCitizens Savings  Bank (\"Citizens\"  or \"Bank\"), which  held a\n\nperfected,  first security  interest in  all of  SPM's assets\n\nexcept  certain  real  estate.    Unsecured  debts  that  had\n\npriority  under  section  507(a)  of the  Code,  11  U.S.C.  \n\n507(a), consisted  primarily of a tax  claim of approximately\n\n$750,000 held by the  Internal Revenue Service (\"I.R.S.\") for\n\nunpaid withholding taxes.   The Shaines are personally liable\n\n                    \n\n1.   For simplicity,  this opinion uses only  the approximate\nvalue  of the various claims  against the Debtor.   The exact\namounts of these claims are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                             -4-\n\nfor whatever portion of that tax claim is not paid out of the\n\nestate.2\n\n          Chapter  11  proceedings  to  reorganize  SPM  were\n\ncontentious and unproductive.   Though the  DIP filed a  plan\n\nfor  reorganization  in  September  1989,  later  amended  in\n\nNovember  1989, the plan was never  confirmed.  The Committee\n\ndecided  at about  the  same time  that reorganization  under\n\ncurrent management was unfeasible,  but that a liquidation of\n\nSPM's  assets would  leave nothing  for any  creditor besides\n\nCitizens,  whose  secured claim  exceeded  the  value of  its\n\ncollateral    (substantially    all    of   SPM's    assets).\n\nConsequently, the  Committee began discussions  with Citizens\n\nabout cooperating  in the bankruptcy proceedings  to maximize\n\nthe  value of  SPM's assets  and provide  some return  to the\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditors.  \n\n          On October  12,  1989, the  Committee and  Citizens\n\nexecuted the agreement (\"Agreement\")  which is the subject of\n\nthis appeal.  The  Agreement recites the opinion of  Citizens\n\nand the Committee that, \"through their mutual cooperation . .\n\n.  in order to maximize recovery on their respective debts it\n\nis in  their mutual interest  to enter into  this Agreement.\"\n\nThe contract explicitly states that  the Committee negotiated\n\n                    \n\n2.  Other creditors  not relevant to this  appeal are various\n\"insiders\" and Heritage Bank for Savings, which held  a valid\nfirst  mortgage  on real  estate  owned  by  SPM in  Holyoke,\nMassachusetts.\n\n                             -5-\n\nand  executed  the  Agreement   on  behalf  of  the  general,\n\nunsecured creditors,  \"[e]xclusive  of the  Internal  Revenue\n\nService and potential 'insider' creditors.\"\n\n          Citizens and the  Committee agreed to  cooperate in\n\nthe  following manner:  (1) to  \"take all  actions reasonably\n\nnecessary,  including,  without  limitation,   initiation  of\n\nmotions  and filing of other  pleadings in the Proceeding, to\n\nreplace Debtor's current CEO with  [a] New Manager\"; (2)  \"to\n\nwork together  to formulate a joint  plan of reorganization\";\n\nand (3) to \"negotiate with one another in good faith to reach\n\nmutually acceptable  agreements\" with respect to  a number of\n\ndetails of the joint plan for reorganization.\n\n          Citizens  and the  Committee also  agreed to  share\n\nwhatever  proceeds   they  received   as  a  result   of  the\n\nreorganization or liquidation of the Debtor.  Section  2.4 of\n\nthe  Agreement   specified   the  terms   of   the   \"sharing\n\narrangement\":\n\n               Any  and  all  net proceeds  of  the\n          sale, refinancing or other disposition of\n          the assets of SPM and also North American\n          Album  Corporation  or  any other  entity\n          whose  assets  are  subject to  Citizens'\n          security   interest   (net  proceeds   is\n          defined as those proceeds remaining after\n          payment of administrative expenses  as so\n          defined  by 11 U.S.C.   503, specifically\n          including  attorney's  fees and  expenses\n          incurred   by   the   Committee  and   by\n          Citizens) received by Citizens and/or the\n          Creditors'   Committee    from   Debtor's\n          operations in whatever form said proceeds\n          make [sic] take (including  proceeds from\n          the operation of  any successor  entity's\n\n                             -6-\n\n          business) or from the sale or disposition\n          of the  Debtor's or a  successor's assets\n          and/or  stock  shall  be divided  between\n          Citizens and the Creditors'  Committee as\n          follows:\n               1.  The  first  $3,000,000  of  such\n          proceeds  shall be shared 90% to Citizens\n          and 10% to  the Creditors' Committee .  .\n          .;\n               2.  The  second $3,000,000  shall be\n          shared   by   citizens   [sic]  and   the\n          Creditors'  Committee  with 80%  going to\n          Citizens  and  20%   to  the   Creditors'\n          Committee;\n               3.  The  next  $3,000,000  shall  be\n          shared  70% to  Citizens and  30%  to the\n          Creditors' Committee;\n               4.  The  next  $3,000,000  shall  be\n          shared  60% to  Citizens  and 40%  to the\n          Creditors' Committee; and\n               5.   All   proceeds  in   excess  of\n          $12,000,000  shall  go to  the Creditor's\n          Committee.\n\nThe  Agreement  contained  a standard  savings  clause  which\n\nprovided that \"[i]n the event of any term or provision hereof\n\nis invalid or unenforceable [the] remainder of this Agreement\n\nshall be  valid and  enforceable to  the extent permitted  by\n\nlaw.\"\n\n          Thereafter,  the  Committee   and  the  Bank  filed\n\nnumerous  motions,  both independently  and  jointly, seeking\n\nunsuccessfully  a  change in  SPM's  management,  a grant  of\n\nrelief from the automatic  stay for Citizens, the appointment\n\nof  a Chapter  11 trustee,  and conversion  of the  case from\n\nChapter 11  to Chapter 7.   At a  motion hearing  in December\n\n1989, the Agreement was  filed with the court as  an exhibit.\n\nThe court  expressed concern  about  the Agreement's  sharing\n\n                             -7-\n\nprovision,  characterizing it  as a  \"tax-avoidance\" scheme.3\n\nHowever, at no time during the reorganization proceedings did\n\nany creditor,  the Shaines or other  interested party4 object\n\nto  the  mutual promises  by  Citizens and  the  Committee to\n\ncooperate during the reorganization  proceedings.  The  court\n\nnever formally  approved or disapproved the  Agreement before\n\nJanuary 1991.\n\n          After  it became  apparent  that SPM  could not  be\n\nsuccessfully  reorganized,  the  bankruptcy court  granted  a\n\nmotion by Citizens on  April 16, 1990, to appoint  a receiver\n\nwith the  power to negotiate  a sale  of all of  SPM's assets\n\npursuant to 11 U.S.C.   363(b).  On December  19, 1990, SPM's\n\nassets were  sold to  Heritage  Albums, Inc.  for a  purchase\n\nprice of $5,000,000.00.   On December 21,  1990, a previously\n\nentered order went into  effect granting Citizens relief from\n\nthe automatic stay, see  11 U.S.C.   362, and  converting the\n                       \n\ncase into a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding, see 11 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n3.   When he  first saw  the Agreement, the  bankruptcy judge\nindicated that  he thought it might  violate section 1129(d),\nwhich prohibits confirmation of a reorganization plan \"if the\nprincipal purpose of the plan is the avoidance of taxes.\"  11\nU.S.C.    1129(d).   Appellees  long ago  abandoned the  tax-\navoidance argument,  probably because the Agreement  is not a\n\"plan\" requiring confirmation  within the meaning of  section\n1129  and thus  not subject  to the  requirements of  section\n1129(d).\n\n4.   Appellee  Stern  was  not  appointed as  the  Chapter  7\ntrustee until December 1990.\n\n                             -8-\n\n1112(b).   After  conversion to  Chapter 7,  appellee Trustee\n\nStern was appointed.  See 11 U.S.C.   701(a).\n                         \n\n          On December  24, 1990, the  Committee and  Citizens\n\nfiled a  joint motion for \"Entry of  Order Requiring Delivery\n\nof  Proceeds  and  Requiring  Expedited  Determination\" which\n\nrequested distribution of the sale proceeds to Citizens.  The\n\nmotion  recited  that  the   entire  amount  was  subject  to\n\nCitizens' security interest pursuant to  11 U.S.C.   506  and\n\nannounced  that, after  receiving the  $5 million  and paying\n\nvarious  administrative fees,  \"Citizens  will  distribute  a\n\nportion  of  the  net   proceeds  to  Kamberg,  Berman,  P.C.\n\n[Committee's counsel] in accordance with its October 12, 1989\n\nagreement  with  the Committee.\"    At a  hearing  before the\n\nbankruptcy  court on  January  3, 1991,  the  Debtor and  the\n\nShaines objected  to the  motion, arguing that  the Agreement\n\ndistributed proceeds to general, unsecured creditors ahead of\n\nthe  priority tax  creditors  in violation  of the  statutory\n\nscheme for distribution.  See 11 U.S.C.    724-726.  Citizens\n                             \n\nand the Committee responded  that the $5 million  belonged to\n\nCitizens and that the Bank had a right  to share its proceeds\n\nwith  the  Committee  without  paying  the  I.R.S.  or  other\n\ncreditors first.         The    bankruptcy    court   granted\n\nCitizens'  and  the  Committee's  motion  to  the  extent  it\n\nrequested satisfaction of Citizens' allowed secured claim for\n\n$5  million,  but  rejected  the  motion  to  the  extent  it\n\n                             -9-\n\nrequested  approval  of the  Agreement's  sharing provision.5\n\nThe bankruptcy  judge explained that he  viewed the Agreement\n\nas  a form of proceeds distribution which did not comply with\n\nthe Code.\n\n               I am not approving  any distribution\n          that   is  not  in  accordance  with  the\n          priority  of the  bankruptcy code,  and I\n          think I made that abundantly clear a long\n          time  ago.   I'm  not going  to have  the\n          bankruptcy code, have  an end-run  around\n          it  in  this court.    The  law sets  out\n          certain  priorities,  and your  committee\n          has  absolutely  no  authority to  short-\n          circuit  those priorities, and  I want to\n          make that clear.\n\nFurthermore,  the bankruptcy  court explained,  the Committee\n\nhas a duty to the bankruptcy estate.\n\n               I rule that the  committee, although\n          it certainly had  authority to  negotiate\n          something   for   the   benefit  of   the\n          bankruptcy  estate,  that  authority  was\n          just that, for the benefit  of the entire\n          bankruptcy estate, and the  committee had\n          no authority, never thought it had    and\n          if it  did [ask  for court  approval], it\n          would  not  have  been  given  it      to\n          negotiate  something  for the  benefit of\n          some sets of  creditors of the bankruptcy\n          estate.\n               It  is  perfectly true  that without\n          the agreement the bankruptcy estate would\n          get  nothing, but once  the committee was\n          in operation it had to, it's required  by\n\n                    \n\n5.   On  its face, the  motion by Citizens  and the Committee\ndoes not request approval of the Agreement.  However,  during\nthe motion hearing, counsel  for Citizens requested the court\nto order the Chapter 7 trustee to oversee the distribution of\nproceeds  to the  general,  unsecured creditors.   The  court\ntreated this request  as part  of the motion  and refused  to\ngrant  it.    We  consider  the  mechanics  of  the  proceeds\ndistribution infra in Part III.\n                  \n\n                             -10-\n\n          law, to act for the benefit of the entire\n          estate . . . .\n\n          In accordance  with its ruling at  the hearing, the\n\nbankruptcy court  issued a  Disbursement Order on  January 8,\n\n1991, ordering the following:\n\n          1.   Citizens is  the holder of  a valid,\n          perfected and  enforceable first security\n          interest  in  all  assets  of  the Debtor\n          excepting only the  real estate owned  by\n          the Debtor;\n\n          2.   Citizens has  a first priority  lien\n          and security interest in all of the post-\n          petition    accounts    receivable    and\n          inventory of the Debtor;\n\n          3.   Citizens'  claim  is  allowed  as  a\n          secured   claim   in   the    amount   of\n          $5,000,000.00, with the remainder allowed\n          as an unsecured claim;\n\n          4.   The net cash proceeds  from the sale\n          of the Debtor's assets held  by Goldstein\n          &amp;   Manello  [Debtor's   counsel],  after\n          payment of its  fee and expenses and  the\n          fee and expenses of Kamberg,  Berman P.C.\n          [the Committee's counsel], shall  be paid\n          over to  Citizens by Goldstein  &amp; Manello\n          in  partial   satisfaction  of  Citizens'\n          claim.\n\n          5.  Citizens shall  pay from the net cash\n          proceeds paid over to  it by Goldstein  &amp;\n          Manello  as aforesaid  such  fees of  the\n          Examiner and any other  party as shall be\n          approved  by  order of  this  court after\n          notice and hearing.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  Citizens   had  previously  agreed   to  the  payment  of\ncounsel's  fees and  other administrative  expenses from  the\nsale  proceeds; it had  included paragraphs four  and five in\nits proposed order attached to the joint motion.\n\n                             -11-\n\nAlthough   the  court  acknowledged  that  Citizens'  allowed\n\nsecured  claim  was  $5  million,  paragraph   six  compelled\n\nCitizens to pay part of that  amount to the Chapter 7 trustee\n\nfor distribution to other creditors:\n\n          6.  After payment  of all fees,  Citizens\n          shall  compute  the  amount  due  to  the\n          Committee under the agreement  of October\n          12,   1989   between  Citizens   and  the\n          Committee.   Citizens shall then pay such\n          amount  to the  trustee in  bankruptcy of\n          SPM Manufacturing  Corporation, who shall\n          administer  the  same in  accordance with\n          the  provisions  of  the Bankruptcy  Code\n          including    the     Code's    provisions\n          concerning priority for tax claims.\n\nThe effect  of paragraph six of  the order is to  deprive the\n\ngeneral, unsecured  creditors of  any amount they  would have\n\nreceived under  the Agreement and to benefit  the I.R.S., the\n\nother priority creditors, and  the Shaines who, as principals\n\nof SPM,  would be personally  liable for  the underlying  tax\n\nobligations.\n\n          Citizens  and the Committee  made timely objections\n\nto the order and appealed to the United States District Court\n\nfor the District  of Massachusetts.   Trustee  Stern and  the\n\nShaines appeared as  appellees, and the funds were  placed in\n\nescrow pending  outcome of  the appeal.   The  district court\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court order, reasoning that it was  a\n\nproper  exercise of the  bankruptcy court's  equitable powers\n\nunder section 105(a) of the Code.  \"[T]he  Disbursement Order\n\nfurthers the  legislative distribution  scheme  in Chapter  7\n\n                             -12-\n\ncases and []  the Sharing  Agreement, in  its original  form,\n\nthwarts  that scheme.\"  The district court explained that, in\n\naccordance with the Code  and Massachusetts contract law, the\n\nbankruptcy court \"reformed\" the  Agreement to comply with the\n\ndistribution scheme of the Code.\n\n          The  Committee  filed  a  timely  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict  court's order.  The  Bank, conceding that the funds\n\nin  escrow belong either to  the Committee or  to the estate,\n\ndoes not join the  appeal.  This court has  jurisdiction over\n\nthis appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   158(d).\n\n                             -13-\n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The facts are essentially undisputed.  The issue on\n\nappeal is whether the  bankruptcy court erred as a  matter of\n\nlaw in ordering Citizens  to pay to the Trustee  that portion\n\nof the Bank's secured interest  which, according to the terms\n\nof the Agreement,  was due to  the Committee.   In an  appeal\n\nfrom  district court review of  a bankruptcy court order, the\n\ncourt of appeals independently reviews the bankruptcy court's\n\ndecision, applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings\n\nof  fact and  de novo review  to conclusions  of law.   In re\n                                                             \n\nLaRoche,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587244\"><a href=\"/opinion/587244/in-re-david-f-laroche-david-f-laroche-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301  (1st Cir. 1992);  In re G.S.F.\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564956\"><a href=\"/opinion/564956/25-collier-bankrcas2d-113-bankr-l-rep-p-74130-in-re-gsf/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1474 (1st  Cir.  1991).

We  consider   each  argument\n\nseparately.\n\n              A. Distribution Scheme of the Code\n                                                \n\n          Appellees   argue   that   allowing  the   general,\n\nunsecured  creditors  to receive  money  under the  Agreement\n\nwhile priority tax creditors  receive nothing would  conflict\n\nwith  the statutory  scheme  for  distribution of  bankruptcy\n\nestate  property.   See 11  U.S.C.    507,  726.   Thus, they\n                       \n\n                    \n\n7.  The parties in their  briefs assume that the amount  owed\nto the  Committee under the Agreement  would be approximately\n$700,000.   However, the actual  amount could be  less due to\npayment  of   administrative  fees  and  expenses   prior  to\ndistribution of the proceeds.  This is not a matter for us to\nresolve.\n\n                             -16-\n\ncontend,  the bankruptcy  court properly  acted in  equity to\n\nprevent  a  violation  of  the  Code's  distribution  scheme.\n\nSection 726 provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n          [P]roperty   of   the  estate   shall  be\n          distributed    \n               (1)   first, in payment of claims of\n          the  kind specified in,  and in the order\n          specified in, section 507 of the title;\n               (2)  second,  in   payment  of   any\n          allowed  unsecured  claim,  other than  a\n          claim  of a  kind specified  in paragraph\n          (1),  (3),  or  (4)  of  this subsection,\n          proof of which is [timely filed.]\n\n11 U.S.C.   726(a).  Section 507 of the Code identifies those\n\nexpenses and  claims which  have priority over  other claims,\n\nincluding  administrative  expenses  allowed   under  section\n\n503(b), claims for wages,  and unsecured tax claims.   See 11\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   507(a)(1), (3), (7).\n\n          However,  the  distribution scheme  of  section 726\n\n(and, by implication, the priorities of section 507) does not\n\ncome  into play  until all  valid liens  on the  property are\n\nsatisfied.

Citizens held a valid\n\nlien on  all  of the  SPM  assets;  these were  sold  for  $5\n\n                             -17-\n\nmillion.    The bankruptcy  court  allowed  Citizens' secured\n\nclaim in that amount.   Clearly, then, absent the  order, the\n\nentire $5 million belonged to Citizens in satisfaction of its\n\nlien,  leaving nothing  for the estate  to distribute  to the\n\nother creditors, including the I.R.S.  The bankruptcy court's\n\norder  forced Citizens to transfer to the estate a portion of\n\nits own $5 million notwithstanding the court's recognition of\n\nCitizens' right to receive that sum in full.\n\n          Because  Citizens' secured  claim  absorbed all  of\n\nSPM's assets, there was  nothing left for any  other creditor\n\nin  this  case.    Ordinarily,  in  such  circumstances,  the\n\ndistributional priorities of sections  726 and 507 would have\n\nbeen  mooted.   Appellees  defend  the outcome  below  on the\n\nground that the Agreement improperly syphoned proceeds to the\n\ngeneral,  unsecured  creditors \"at  the  expense  of priority\n\ncreditors.\"   However,  it is  hard to  see how  the priority\n\ncreditors lost anything owed them given the  fact there would\n\nhave been nothing left  for the priority creditors after  the\n\n$5 million was distributed  to Citizens.  The  \"syphoning\" of\n\nthe money to general,  unsecured creditors came entirely from\n\nthe  $5 million belonging to  Citizens, to which  no one else\n\nhad any claim of right under the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          Appellees point to the Agreement's  sharing formula\n\nand ask  how the parties  could contemplate sharing  over $12\n\nmillion  when Citizens' claim was worth only $9 million.  The\n\n                             -18-\n\nAgreement,  it  is  said,  could   not  contemplate  dividing\n\nproperty  that did not belong to the parties to the contract.\n\nBut  appellees' assertion  is based  on a  misreading of  the\n\nAgreement.  The Agreement merely states that Citizens and the\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditors will pool whatever they received\n                                                             \n\nfrom  the bankruptcy  estate (either  in a  reorganization or\n\nliquidation)  and will  then  divide the  pooled funds  among\n\nthemselves.   Any sharing  between Citizens and  the general,\n\nunsecured creditors  was to  occur after distribution  of the\n                                        \n\nestate property, having no  effect whatever on the bankruptcy\n\ndistributions to other creditors.\n\n          This crucial  fact remains true under any scenario.\n\nWhen the Agreement was signed in October 1989, the value of a\n\nreorganized  or  liquidated  SPM   was  unknown.    Assume  a\n\nliquidation would have produced  $15 million after payment of\n\nthe various  administrative expenses.  If  that had happened,\n\nthe  first  $9  million  would  have  gone   to  Citizens  in\n\nsatisfaction of its  lien, and  the rest of  the money  would\n\nhave been  distributed pursuant to section  726 (assuming the\n\ncase  had already been converted  to Chapter 7).   Hence, the\n\nnext $800,000 or so would have been distributed to the I.R.S.\n\nand other priority creditors,  and the remaining $5.2 million\n\nwould  have  gone  to  the general,  unsecured  creditors  in\n\nvirtual  satisfaction of  their  $5.5 million  claim, leaving\n\nnothing for \"insiders\" and  other subordinated creditors.  By\n\n                             -19-\n\nits  terms, the sharing formula  in the Agreement  is to take\n\neffect  only  after a  proper  distribution  under the  Code.\n\nCitizens and the  Committee would have pooled  only their own\n\nbankruptcy dividends   for a combined $14.2  million and then\n\nsplit  this  sum  according   to  the  Agreement's   formula.\n\nDistributions  to the  I.R.S. and  all other  creditors under\n\nsection   726  would  be  unaffected.     Under  any  set  of\n\nassumptions, then, the Agreement does not distribute property\n\nof the estate \"at the expense of\" priority creditors nor does\n\nit  violate  the distribution  scheme of  section 726  or the\n\npriorities of section 507.  \n\n          Appellees  argue,  in  the  alternative,  that  the\n\nAgreement   conflicts  with   the   spirit   of  the   Code's\n\ndistribution  scheme, under  which priority  creditors always\n\nget paid in full  before general, unsecured creditors receive\n\nanything.    Appellees  contend  that  Congress never  wanted\n\nunsecured  creditors     especially creditors  represented by\n\nthe  official   creditors'  committee       to  be   able  to\n\n\"circumvent\"   this  scheme   by  negotiating   with  secured\n\ncreditors to  increase the  return received for  their claims\n\nagainst the debtor.   Appellees' theory, however, goes beyond\n\nanything appearing  expressly or by implication  in the Code.\n\nSection   726  and  the   other  Code   provisions  governing\n\npriorities  of  creditors  apply  only  to  distributions  of\n\nproperty of the estate.  The  Code does not govern the rights\n\n                             -20-\n\nof  creditors  to  transfer  or receive  nonestate  property.\n\nWhile  the  debtor and  the trustee  are  not allowed  to pay\n\nnonpriority creditors  ahead of priority  creditors, see King\n                                                             \n\nv.

Appellees concede that the  bankruptcy court\n\nhas  no authority  to control  how  Citizens disposes  of the\n\nproceeds once it receives them.  There is nothing in the Code\n\nforbidding Citizens  to have  voluntarily paid part  of these\n\nmonies to  some or  all of  the general,  unsecured creditors\n\nafter the bankruptcy proceedings finished.\n\n                             -21-\n\n          Thus,  appellees'  argument  reduces to  contending\n\nthat although  a  secured  creditor  is  free  to  share  its\n\nproceeds   with   nonpriority   creditors  after   bankruptcy\n\nproceedings have concluded, it may not enter into a  contract\n\nduring  bankruptcy in which it promises to do the same thing.\n      \n\nAgain,  appellees' argument  lacks statutory  support for  it\n\nconfuses  estate  property  and   nonestate  property.

This  theory of  Code\n\npolicy is directly contradicted  by the fact that nonpriority\n\ncreditors   routinely receive payment from  third parties for\n\ntheir  claims without interference  by the  bankruptcy court.\n\nUnsecured creditors often sell their claims to third parties,\n\ne.g.,  for 30  cents on  the dollar,  in order  to avoid  the\n\nuncertainty and  delay of bankruptcy proceedings.

If the  general, unsecured\n\ncreditors  in this case had sold their claims to Citizens (or\n\nanother third party)  for cash,  e.g., for ten  cents on  the\n\ndollar, after  all was said  and done the  priority creditors\n\nwould  have  received  nothing  and  the  general,  unsecured\n\ncreditors would have received  approximately $550,000 (10% of\n\ntheir $5.5 million total claim).  The  bankruptcy court would\n\nhave  had  no authority  to  prevent  the general,  unsecured\n\ncreditors  from transferring  their  claims.   In comparison,\n\nunder  the  Agreement's  sharing  arrangement   the  general,\n\nunsecured  creditors   would  receive,  under   the  parties'\n\ncalculations, see note 7, approximately $700,000 (about 12.5%\n                 \n\nof their  claims) while  priority creditors  receive nothing.\n\nGiven authority  in the Bankruptcy  Code and Rules  to permit\n\noutright  transfers resulting in general, unsecured creditors\n\nreceiving some  money  for their  claims, we  see nothing  to\n\nprohibit the  same result if produced by a partial assignment\n\nor sharing of claims such as accomplished by the Agreement in\n\nthis case.\n\n          Because  Code  provisions governing  priorities and\n\ndistribution of  estate property gave the estate  no right to\n\nshare   in  proceeds  from   Citizens'  secured   claim,  the\n\nbankruptcy court derived no right under those same provisions\n\n                             -26-\n\nto order Citizens to pay a portion of its  own claim proceeds\n\nto the estate.\n\n              B.

The\n\nCode expressly authorizes a  committee to \"perform such other\n\nservices  as are in the  interest of those  represented.\"  11\n\nU.S.C.     1103(c)(5).    Appellees  also  concede  that  the\n\nCommittee's appointment  pursuant  to  11  U.S.C.     1102(a)\n\ncharged it only with representation of the general, unsecured\n\ncreditors  (not with  representation of  the I.R.S.  or other\n\npriority  creditors).     Nevertheless,  they   contend,  any\n\nagreement  negotiated  by  the  Committee  should  have  been\n\nnegotiated  to benefit  the estate  as a  whole and  thus any\n\ncontractual right to receive payment from Citizens rightfully\n\nbelongs to the estate.\n\n                             -27-\n\n          We do not accept this contention, as it seems based\n\non  the  erroneous  assumption  that  the Official  Unsecured\n\nCreditors'  Committee is  a  fiduciary for  the  estate as  a\n\nwhole.  While a creditors' committee and its members must act\n\nin accordance with the provisions  of the Bankruptcy Code and\n\nwith proper regard for the bankruptcy court, the committee is\n\na  fiduciary for those whom it represents, not for the debtor\n\nor the estate generally.

Though the Shaines knew of\n\nthe Agreement's  existence  since December  1989, they  never\n\ncomplained to  the bankruptcy  court about Citizens'  and the\n\nCommittee's  joining  of  forces  during  the  reorganization\n\n                             -30-\n\nproceedings;   they   raised   questions   only   about   the\n\ndistribution of Citizens' proceeds to  nonpriority creditors.\n\nThe bankruptcy court  gave no indication in  its findings and\n\nrulings that it was bothered by that aspect of the Agreement.\n\nNot until oral argument before  the district court hearing on\n\nthis appeal  did  the  Shaines  and the  Trustee  invoke  the\n\nalleged negative  effects on reorganization of  the Citizens-\n\nCommittee alliance.  \n\n          It  is  true  that,  in the  interest  of  justice,\n\nparties are sometimes permitted to offer unraised alternative\n\nrationales  for  affirming a  judgment.    See,  e.g., In  re\n                                                             \n\nKillebrew,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531854\"><a href=\"/opinion/531854/in-the-matter-of-mack-l-killebrew-and-delores-b-killebrew-debtors-mack/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1521  (5th  Cir.  1989).    But\n         \n\nappellees' contention  here that the Agreement  disrupted the\n\nDebtor's reorganization proceedings is essentially  a factual\n\nissue requiring  findings of fact  not now  contained in  the\n\nrecord before  us.   The bankruptcy  court, not the  district\n\ncourt or court of  appeals, is the only tribunal  equipped to\n\nmake evidentiary findings on relevant factual matters such as\n\nwhether the parties acted  in bad faith, whether  the parties\n\nintended to frustrate attempts  to reorganize the Debtor, and\n\nwhether the  parties' actions  actually prevented  the Debtor\n\nfrom successfully reorganizing.   See Bankruptcy Rules  7052,\n                                     \n\n8013; In re Sublett, 895 F.2d at 1384.  We are in no position\n                   \n\nto  ascertain by  ourselves whether  the Agreement,  in fact,\n\ninterfered unjustifiably with the reorganization proceedings.\n\n                             -31-\n\nSee In re  Sun Runner Marine,  945 F.2d at  1095 (\"We do  not\n                            \n\nknow  what legal  standard  the bankruptcy  court would  have\n\napplied,  or whether  the bankruptcy  court would  have found\n\nfacts warranting  [the parties'  requested  order], had  that\n\nissue been presented to it.\")\n\n          We respond  briefly to  appellees' warning  that if\n\nthis  agreement stands,  creditors  in the  future will  form\n\nalliances  to  defeat attempts  to reorganize,  extort higher\n\npayouts from  debtors, and generally create  chaos in Chapter\n\n11.  Our  focus is  necessarily on  the particular  agreement\n\nbefore   us,   to  see   whether   it   conflicts  with   the\n\nreorganization  provisions of  Chapter  11  and  whether  the\n\nrecord supports  appellees' portrait  of the dire  effects of\n\ngiving effect to such a contract.  Insofar as we can see, the\n\nparties'  promises made  in  the Agreement  were well  within\n\ntheir  rights under the Bankruptcy  Code: they agreed to move\n\nthe  bankruptcy   court  to  replace   the  Debtor's  current\n\nmanagement,  see 11  U.S.C.    1104(a),(b), and to  propose a\n                \n\nplan  of reorganization, see 11 U.S.C.   1121(c).  The record\n                            \n\nshows  that, in addition to the joint motions contemplated by\n\nthe Agreement, the  parties moved for conversion  of the case\n\nto  Chapter 7.    This  action was  allowed  by  11 U.S.C.   \n\n1112(b).  We see no indication in the Agreement that Citizens\n\nand  the  Committee  agreed  to  vote  for  or   against  any\n\nparticular plans, a restriction  which could raise charges of\n\n                             -32-\n\nbad faith.

Appellees have not pointed  to any\n\nother Code  provision implicated by  the parties' cooperative\n\nefforts.    Looking at  the  ones mentioned,  we  cannot find\n\nsupport   for  appellees'   assertion  that   this  agreement\n\nconflicts  with  any  policy   in  favor  of  reorganizations\n\nmanifested by Chapter 11.\n\n          As for  future cases,  we note that  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  always retains  the power  to monitor and  control the\n\ntenor  of  reorganization  proceedings.    If  the  unsecured\n\ncreditors' committee fails to  be properly  representative of\n\nthe unsecured  creditors, any party  in interest can  move to\n\nhave  the   committee  reconstituted.     See  11   U.S.C.   \n                                             \n\n1102(a)(2); In  re Daig Corp., 17 B.R. at 42.  If an entity's\n\n                             \n\nacceptance or rejection of a plan is not made in  good faith,\n\nor was not solicited or procured in good faith, the court can\n\ndisqualify that vote.   See 11  U.S.C.    1126(e).  The  good\n                           \n\nfaith requirement  bars creditors  from  casting their  votes\n\nfrom ulterior motives, such as coercing a higher payment from\n\nthe debtor's estate, pure malice, and advancing the interests\n\nof a competing business.  In re Federal Support Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512682\"><a href=\"/opinion/512682/in-re-federal-support-company-debtor-two-cases-insinger-machine/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                   \n\n<span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (4th Cir. 1988).  The record contains no evidence that\n\nCitizens  and  the  Committee  harbored  any   such  sinister\n\ndesigns.\n\n                             -33-\n\n          Appellees  assert  that  creditors  should  not  do\n\nanything to  alter the usual divergence  of interests between\n\nsecured  and unsecured  creditors.   While  secured creditors\n\nmight  generally prefer  liquidation and  unsecured creditors\n\nmight generally  support reorganization, the Code surely does\n\nnot  require them to take  such positions.   No two creditors\n\nhave identical  interests, see  In re  Microboard Processing,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 95 B.R. at 285, and the Code implicitly recognizes that\n    \n\nfact  by providing  a procedural  framework for  handling the\n\nvarious divergent  interests of the parties  to a bankruptcy.\n\nSee Elizabeth Warren,  Bankruptcy Policy, 54 U. Chi.  L. Rev.\n                                        \n\n775, 785-89 (1987); see also  Elizabeth Warren &amp; Jay Lawrence\n                            \n\nWestbrook, The Law  of Debtors and  Creditors 427-35 (2d  ed.\n                                             \n\n1991).  While unsecured  creditors may sometimes share common\n\nobjectives with  the debtor and current  management, they are\n\nnot  required to rubber stamp the proposals of the debtor nor\n\nto  support the retention of  current management.   See In re\n                                                             \n\nFederal Support Co.,  859 F.2d at 19 (\"It  is well settled []\n                   \n\nthat good faith  in casting  a vote does  not require of  the\n\ncreditor a selfless disinterest.\")  The duty of the unsecured\n\ncreditors'  committee to  pursue  the best  interests of  the\n\nunsecured  creditors requires different outcomes in different\n\nsituations,  and  may  entail  entering  contracts  regarding\n\nreorganization plans,  see, e.g.,  In re Donlevy's  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960653\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960653/in-re-donlevys-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (Bankr.

For the  reasons discussed,\n             \n\nwe  do  not  think  that  the  bankruptcy  court's  order was\n\njustified as a means to enforce the rules or policies spelled\n\nout in Chapter 11.11\n\n                      D. Other Arguments\n                                        \n\n          We briefly dispose of the parties' other arguments.\n\nWe reject  appellees' argument that Citizens,  by agreeing to\n\nshare  some of  its bankruptcy  proceeds with  the Committee,\n\n\"carved  out\" or \"divested itself\"  of a portion  of its lien\n\nand  thus the  court  \"simply used  its  equitable powers  to\n\ndetermine who best  was entitled to  receive this carved  out\n\nportion\"  of Citizens'  claim.   This  argument is  untenable\n\nbecause  no  appeal was  taken  from  the bankruptcy  court's\n\nexpress  ruling that  Citizens,  pursuant to  its $5  million\n\nallowed  secured claim,  was entitled  to receive  the entire\n\nsale proceeds.  Furthermore,  under Massachusetts law a valid\n\nassignment  of  a  debt does  not  divest  the  claim of  its\n\npriority  or alter the  debtor's obligation to  pay the debt;\n\n                    \n\n11.  Even,  indeed, if an  alliance of the  type reflected in\nthe   Agreement  were   believed  to   contravene  bankruptcy\npolicies, the remedy     ordering Citizens to pay out  to the\nestate funds it  had agreed to pay to the  Committee    would\nseem questionable.  If  the Agreement violated public policy,\nthe  more usual  remedy would  be to  declare it  invalid and\nunenforceable  rather than  to enforce  it, out  of Citizens'\npocket, in favor of a nonparty  to the Agreement. \n\n                             -35-\n\nthe assignee steps  into the  shoes of the  assignor for  the\n\nportion  of  the claim  assigned.12   See  Mass.

CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n12.  We assume, for the moment,  that the Agreement could  be\ncharacterized as a partial assignment of the parties' claims.\nAs  explained infra note 13, the issue of how to characterize\n                   \nthe Agreement is not before us.\n\n13.  How to  categorize the Agreement is  no simple question.\nIt  has  attributes  of  both  a  partial  assignment  and  a\nsubordination agreement.  See generally David Gray Carlson, A\n                                                             \nTheory of  Contractual Debt Subordination  and Lien Priority,\n                                                            \n38 Vand.  L. Rev. 975 (1985)  (discussing the characteristics\nof and  enforceability of various types  of subordination and\nassignment agreements in bankruptcy).   Even if it cannot  be\ndeemed a  subordination agreement for purposes of enforcement\npursuant to 11 U.S.C.   510(a), the question on appeal is not\nwhether the  Agreement is valid and  enforceable, but whether\nthe  bankruptcy court had  authority under the  Code to issue\nits order. \n\n                             -36-\n\n          For the  reasons discussed above, we  hold that the\n\nbankruptcy court  erred  as  a  matter  of  law  in  ordering\n\nCitizens  to pay  to  the  Trustee  the  amount  due  to  the\n\nCommittee under  the Agreement.  Accordingly,  we reverse the\n\njudgment of  the district court  and vacate paragraph  six of\n\nthe bankruptcy court's Disbursement Order of January 8, 1991.\n\n          No question is raised in this appeal  as to whether\n\nthe  Agreement  is binding  on  Citizens  and the  Committee.\n\nIndeed, Citizens previously expressed, at hearings before the\n\nbankruptcy   court  and  the  district  court,  its  complete\n\nwillingness to abide by its obligation under the Agreement to\n\npay the  Committee the agreed share of the sale proceeds.  At\n\nthe  hearing  on  January   3,  1991,  counsel  for  Citizens\n\nrequested the court to order the Chapter 7 Trustee to oversee\n\nthe distribution  of the  proceeds to the  general, unsecured\n\ncreditors.  Appellees Robert and Frances Shaine  point out in\n\ntheir  appellate  brief that  the  mechanics of  distributing\n\nthese proceeds  to the general, unsecured  creditors were not\n\nmade clear  in the  Agreement, nor did  the bankruptcy  court\n\ndecide how the proceeds should be handled.\n\n          Consequently,   having   reversed  the   bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order, we remand to the bankruptcy court to determine\n\nwhether  to  allow  Citizens'  motion  to  have  the  Trustee\n\nadminister the distribution  of the funds due to the general,\n\n                             -37-\n\nunsecured creditors  under the Agreement.   Appellant has not\n\npointed to any basis  in the Code for authorizing,  let alone\n\nrequiring, the  bankruptcy court  or Trustee to  administer a\n\ndistribution   of  nonestate  funds  pursuant  to  a  private\n\nagreement.   However, because we  lack a complete  record and\n\nbecause the precise issue was not appealed, we leave it up to\n\nthe  bankruptcy  court  to  decide, in  the  first  instance,\n\nwhether  to  order  the  Trustee (rather  than  Citizens)  to\n\nadminister the distribution, and to determine  the allocation\n\nof any  related administrative  expenses.  If  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  determines  that   the  Trustee  should   not  oversee\n\ndistribution,  or if  Citizens withdraws  its motion  for the\n\nTrustee to  administer the  funds, then the  bankruptcy court\n\nshall  distribute  the  funds in  escrow,  including  accrued\n\ninterest, to Citizens  subject to  any proper  administrative\n\ncharges or other obligations.\n\n          The  district  court  judgment  is   reversed,  the\n                                                             \n\nbankruptcy  court order is vacated in part, and the matter is\n                                                             \n\nremanded for  further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. \n                                                            \n\nCosts to appellant. \n                  \n\n                             -38-\n</pre>",
