Almond,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Anthony   C.\n                                                                  \nDiGioia, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n   \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   The  appellant, John Lapinski,  appeals an\n               \n\norder of the  district court revoking his term  of supervised\n\nrelease and imposing an  18 month term of incarceration.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  1989, Lapinski  pled  guilty, in  the United  States\n\nDistrict  Court for the Southern  District of Florida, to one\n\ncount  of knowingly  and  with intent  to defraud  possessing\n\nfifteen  or more unauthorized  access devices [credit cards],\n\nin  violation of 18 U.S.C.   1029(a)(3).  He was sentenced to\n\na  27  month term  of  imprisonment  and  a  3 year  term  of\n\nsupervised  release.   Among  the  conditions  applicable  to\n\nLapinski s term of supervised  release was the standard that,\n\nwhile  on supervised  release,  he shall  not commit  another\n\nfederal, state, or local crime.\n\n     Upon his  release from  prison, Lapinski moved  to Rhode\n\nIsland  and his  supervision  was transferred  to the  United\n\nStates Probation  Department there.  In 1991, he was arrested\n\nand charged with  2 counts  of sexual assault  in the  second\n\ndegree.   In February 1992,  Lapinski entered a  plea of nolo\n\ncontendere  to the  reduced  charges of  2  counts of  simple\n\nassault.  He was sentenced to  a 1 year term of imprisonment,\n\nsuspended, and placed on probation for 1 year.\n\n     Shortly thereafter, at the request of Lapinski s federal\n\nprobation officer in Rhode Island, jurisdiction over Lapinski\n\nwas transferred from the Southern District  of Florida to the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island where a supervised release violation\n\nhearing  was  held  on  June  29, 1992.    See  18  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n3583(e)(3).\n\n                             II.\n\n     Lapinski  was represented  by counsel  at the  violation\n\nhearing,  where the  government presented  2 witnesses  and 5\n\nexhibits.  The  exhibits were  (1) a June  12, 1991  criminal\n\ncomplaint   report  filed  by   Collene  Garafola   with  the\n\nMiddletown, Rhode Island Police  Department, (2) an August 7,\n\n1991 sworn statement of Ms. Garafola, (3) a certified copy of\n\nthe judgment  of conviction from  the State of  Rhode Island,\n\n(4)  a copy of the  judgment of conviction  from the Southern\n\nDistrict of Florida, and (5) a copy of the presentence report\n\nin  the Florida case.   The witnesses were  Sergeant Hazel of\n\nthe Middletown Police Department and United  States Probation\n\nOfficer Kurt O Sullivan.1\n\n     In the criminal complaint report filed on June 12, 1991,\n\nMs. Garafola recited  that, on that  day, while walking  from\n\nLucy s  Hearth2 to a 7  Eleven store, she saw  a man in a car\n\nstopped at a light.  The  man then parked the car and watched\n\n                    \n\n1.  As Lapinski  raises no issues regarding  the testimony of\nProbation Officer O Sullivan  or the admission into  evidence\nof the Florida judgment or  related presentence report, we do\nnot discuss them further.\n\n2.  Lucy s  Hearth is a  shelter for women,  located near St.\nLucy s Church, in Middletown.\n\n                             -3-\n\nher.  As she was making a  phone call, the man drove his  car\n\nback to  the store,  got out,  and stood near  the glass  and\n\nwatched her.   The  man then  drove away.   She  reported the\n\nlicense plate number of the car and stated that this same man\n\nhad been harassing her and  several other residents of Lucy s\n\nHearth.   She described what he was wearing and reported that\n\nhe was white,  approximately 25-26 years  of age, 5 9\"  tall,\n\nthin, with  a  light complexion,  dirty blond  hair and  blue\n\neyes.   She  reported that  she believed  his first  name was\n\nJohn.\n\n     She also reported  that this same man had  assaulted her\n\noutside that  same store, four  days earlier, on June  8.  He\n\nran up behind her, grabbed her by the back of  the shirt, and\n\nturned her around.  He then  grabbed her buttocks and put one\n\nof his hands up her shirt, touching her breast.  She reported\n\nthat she kneed him in the groin and ran back to the shelter.\n\n     Sergeant Hazel testified that  this complaint was a true\n\nand accurate copy of the complaint filed by Ms. Garafola.  He\n\nalso  testified  that,  in investigating  this  complaint, he\n\ninterviewed Ms. Garafola and took a sworn statement from her.\n\nIn the  sworn statement of  August 73, Ms.  Garafola reported\n\n                    \n\n3.  Lapinski insists that this August 7 statement is unsworn.\nBut, Lapinski did not  object to the statement on  the ground\nthat  it  was unsworn.   \"Absent  plain  error, an  issue not\npresented  to  the district  court cannot  be raised  for the\nfirst time on appeal.\"   United States v. Chaklader,  No. 92-\n                                                   \n1818, 1993 WL 57772, at  *2 (1st Cir. Mar. 10, 1993).   Plain\n                                               (continued...)\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat, in May  1991, this same  man had pulled  up in his  car\n\nwhile  she was walking in the church parking lot and inquired\n\nabout the shelter.   He said that he lived  across the street\n\nand asked whether there were any single women there who would\n\nbe willing to move in  with him.  He asked her  name, whether\n\nshe had a  boyfriend or children, and  told her that she  was\n\nbeautiful.    She  walked  away.    A  week  later,  the  man\n\nreappeared in  his car as she was walking to the shelter.  He\n\nasked  whether she  had spoken  to any  women at  the shelter\n\nabout his offer.  Ms. Garafola told him that she had not said\n\nanything and left.\n\n                    \n\n3.  (...continued)\nerrors  are those  which are  \" particularly egregious \"  and\n\" seriously   affect  the   fairness,  integrity   or  public\nreputation  of  judicial  proceedings. \"   United  States  v.\n                                                         \nYoung, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985) (citations omitted).\n     \n     The statement, signed by Ms. Garafola, evidences that it\nwas  \"subscribed and  sworn\"  and contains  the signature  of\nSergeant Hazel  as notary  public.  Sergeant  Hazel testified\nthat he  reviewed  the accuracy  of  the statement  with  Ms.\nGarafola,  advised her  of the penalties  of perjury  and the\nconsequences   of  filing   a   false   police  report,   and\nadministered the oath to  her.  This would seem  to establish\nthat, in fact, the  statement was a sworn  statement, despite\nLapinski s  present   objection  that  it  lacked  a  written\nrecitation  thereon that  it  was signed  under penalties  of\nperjury.  See Peters v. United States, 408 F.2d 719, 722 (Ct.\n                                     \nCl. 1969) (holding that the absence of the formal requirement\nof a notarization in sworn affidavits did  not invalidate the\nstatements  or  render  them  inadmissible  since  they  were\nactually  sworn to  before an  officer who was  authorized to\nadminister an oath and who testified at subsequent hearing to\nthe procedures followed).  Thus, there was no error, plain or\notherwise, in the characterization  of the August 7 statement\nas sworn and, like both parties and the court below, we shall\naccept it as such.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     The sworn statement also  described the assault in June.\n\nThe description of the assault in the sworn statement was, in\n\nall respects, consistent  with the description of  the June 8\n\nassault  in  the previously-filed  criminal  complaint.   The\n\ndescription of the assailant  differed slightly, however.  In\n\nher sworn statement, Ms.  Garafola described her assailant as\n\nwhite, around  6  tall,  thin, with  medium skin tone,  light\n\nbrown hair, and said that he \"might have\" blue eyes.\n\n     In addition,  Sergeant Hazel testified that he had run a\n\ncheck of the  license plate number  reported by Ms.  Garafola\n\nand  it was registered to  John Angelico.4   He presented Ms.\n\nGarafola with an array  of 6 photographs.  He  testified that\n\nshe selected Lapinski s photograph as that of the man who had\n\nassaulted her and stated to him that she was 100 percent sure\n\nof  that fact.   In  her sworn  statement, Ms.  Garafola also\n\nreported that she was positive that the man in the photograph\n\nshe selected was the man who had assaulted her.\n\n     Lapinski s  counsel raised no objection to the admission\n\nof the June 12 criminal complaint or to the certified copy of\n\nthe  Rhode Island judgment of conviction.  He objected to the\n\nadmission  of the  August 7,  1991 sworn  statement as  being\n\nstale.  That objection  was overruled.  On cross-examination,\n\nSergeant Hazel conceded that he  had not taken Ms. Garafola s\n\n                    \n\n4.  It is undisputed that  John Angelico is an alias  of John\nLapinski.\n\n                             -6-\n\noriginal  statement  of   June  12  and  Lapinski s   counsel\n\nhighlighted the differing descriptions of the assailant given\n\nby Ms. Garafola in her two statements.\n\n     Lapinski also testified.  He stated that he had a common\n\nlaw  wife, with whom  he had been  living for 8  years, and 1\n\nchild.  He further stated that he  recalled seeing a woman in\n\nfront of  the 7 Eleven store  in June 1991.   She looked like\n\nshe was  crying.  He pulled  over in his car to  talk to her.\n\nShe  said she had  a problem with her  boyfriend and that she\n\nwas staying at a shelter.  He told her  his name and that, if\n\nshe ever needed  anything, he  lived across the  street.   He\n\nremained  in his car the  entire time.   The stoplight turned\n\ngreen;  he drove  away and  never spoke  to  her again.   The\n\nexchange lasted perhaps 1 or 2 minutes.\n\n     His counsel  further inquired, \"Were you  trying to pick\n\nher  up?\"  Lapinski answered,  \"Yeah. ... well  not trying to\n\npick  her up so much, but more to, you know to make a friend.\n\nI mean, I,  you know, try to be friendly  with as many people\n\nas I can.\"   Lapinski stated that, although he never spoke to\n\nher  again, she  may have  seen him  because, in  addition to\n\nliving across the street  from the 7 Eleven store,  he worked\n\nin  an apartment complex next door to that store and traveled\n\nback and forth many times daily.  He also testified variously\n\nthat he was \"about 6 2\"\" and \"probably 6 2 \" maybe.  Almost 6\n\nfeet,  close  to  it.\"    He  testified  that  he  pled  nolo\n\n                             -7-\n\ncontendere to simple assault on counsel s  advice that he had\n\nno other choice, but  that he never had any  physical contact\n\nwith Ms. Garafola.\n\n     On cross-examination, Lapinski testified  that, although\n\nhe  recalled speaking  to a  woman in  front of the  7 Eleven\n\nstore in May, June, or July  1991, he did not recall what she\n\nlooked  like or  know whether  the incident  involved Collene\n\nGarafola.  He  did recall  that the road  was extremely  busy\n\nwith  traffic and that  one had to  be alert  because of cars\n\npulling in and  out of  the traffic lanes.   Nonetheless,  he\n\nobserved a  woman looking  depressed and leaning  against the\n\nbus stop on the side of the road.\n\n     The following exchange also occurred:\n\nDiGioia5:      Isn t  it  true  that you ve  been  trying  to\n               pick up,  if you will, young  ladies who lived\n               in that shelter --\n\nLapinski:      Well --\n\nDiGioia:       the better part of the month of May, June, and\n               July?\n\nLapinski:      Yes, I  talked to a few women on the -- in the\n               area,  and one  other  one I  found that  also\n               lives in the shelter.\n\nDiGioia:       And isn t  it true that  you were specifically\n               looking for  women who  looked like  they came\n               from the shelter?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.  When I --\n\n                    \n\n5.  Anthony DiGioia was the government s attorney.\n\n                             -8-\n\nDiGioia:       Isn t it true  that you  would approach  these\n               women and ask them if they would come  to live\n               with you just for cooking and cleaning?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.   I never  asked them to  -- if  they\n               wanted to cook and cleaning [sic].\n\nDiGioia:       Now, did you  every [sic]  approach any  young\n               lady down there, in  that vicinity and ask her\n               to come stay with you, and  make a motion down\n               towards, towards your pants, a motion as if to\n               indicate masturbating?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.\n\nDiGioia:       Never did anything like that?\n\nLapinski:      No. Why?  That s senseless.\n\nDiGioia:       That s senseless?  Your only approach to these\n               young  women was that you were concerned about\n               trying  to  help   them  out,  is  that   your\n               testimony?\n\nLapinski:      Not concerned  about trying to help  them out.\n               But,  you know,  concerned about  maybe taking\n               them  for a,  for a  dinner, or  for a  drink.\n               That s it.  I mean  I m not a -- in the  paper\n               they  made it look like a maniac I jump out of\n               a  car and I beat somebody up for what reason?\n               I don t  understand.  What s the  -- you know,\n               in front of millions of people -- not millions\n               of people, but at  least hundreds of people in\n               shopping   plaza,  next   door.      I   don t\n               understand.\n\n     Lapinski testified that  he had no  choice but to  plead\n\nnolo contendere because, he  said, his retained counsel would\n\nno  longer represent him without an additional fee.  He never\n\ninformed the state  court that he  could not afford  counsel.\n\nHe said that he tried to tell the judge  that he wanted to go\n\nto  trial but could not afford counsel, but that his attorney\n\n                             -9-\n\n\"kept elbowing  me in the  side saying,  \"No.   No.\"\" and  he\n\nnever had the chance to tell his side of the story.\n\n     The  district  court found  by  a  preponderance of  the\n\nevidence that  Lapinski  committed  a  second  degree  sexual\n\nassault  on  or about  June 8,  1991,  in violation  of Rhode\n\nIsland General Laws    11-37-4 and 5  and in violation of the\n\nconditions  of his supervised release.6   The court found the\n\n\"vivid\"  account  of  the  incident contained  in  the  sworn\n\nstatement  to  be  credible.     Further,  Ms.  Garafola  had\n\ndescribed Lapinski and his automobile and  had picked out his\n\nphotograph  from the  array.   The  court found  not credible\n\nLapinski s  testimony that he stopped at the side of the road\n\n                    \n\n6.  Lapinski pled  nolo contendere  to the lesser  charges of\nsimple assault.  However,\n          [u]nder  18  U.S.C.       3563(a)(1)  and\n          3583(d),   a   mandatory   condition   of\n          probation and supervised release  is that\n          the defendant not commit another federal,\n          state,  or local crime.   A  violation of\n          this condition may be charged  whether or\n          not the defendant has been the subject of\n          a  separate  federal,  state,   or  local\n          prosecution for such conduct.   The grade\n          of  violation  does not  depend  upon the\n          conduct that  is the subject  of criminal\n          charges  or  of  which  the  defendant is\n          convicted   in  a   criminal  proceeding.\n          Rather, the grade of the violation is  to\n          be  based  on   the  defendant's   actual\n          conduct.\nU.S.S.G.  7B1.1, comment. (n.1).\n\n     The preponderance  of  the evidence  is  the  applicable\nstandard for  the revocation  of supervised release.   United\n                                                             \nStates v. Portalla,  985 F.2d  621, 622 (1st  Cir. 1993);  18\n                  \nU.S.C.   3583(e)(3).\n\n                             -10-\n\nto  comfort  and try  to  make friends  with  depressed young\n\nwomen.  Nor  did it find credible Lapinski s  suggestion that\n\nhis nolo contendere plea was involuntary.\n\n     Pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.  7B1.1(a)(2),p.s.,  second degree\n\nsexual  assault is  a  Grade B  Violation.   With  Lapinski s\n\nCriminal History Category of IV, the guidelines established a\n\nsentencing range of 12 to 18 months.  U.S.S.G.  7B1.4(a),p.s.\n\nBased on the evidence,  Lapinski s prior history of probation\n\nrevocation, and its conclusion that Lapinski s  testimony was\n\nperjured,  the  district  court  concluded  that  a   lengthy\n\nsentence  of  incarceration was  necessary  and ordered  that\n\nLapinski be sentenced to an 18 month term of imprisonment.\n\n                             III.\n\n     On  appeal, Lapinski  claims that  evidence of  his nolo\n\ncontendere was  improperly admitted  and that he  should have\n\nbeen allowed  to  confront and  cross-examine  Ms.  Garafola.\n\nThese  arguments  were  not  raised in  the  district  court.\n\nTherefore, as with his  contention that Ms. Garafola s August\n\n7 statement was unsworn,  supra at note 3, we review only for\n                               \n\nplain error.\n\n                              A.\n\n     We turn to his claim regarding the nolo contendere plea.\n\nLapinski  argues that it was admitted in violation of Fed.

P.\n\nstates, in pertinent part:\n\n          Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph\n     [not relevant  here], evidence of the  following is\n     not,   in   any  civil   or   criminal  proceeding,\n     admissible against the defendant who  made the plea\n     or was a participant in the plea discussions:\n                            . . .\n          (B) a plea of nolo contendere.\n\n     Our  response is multifold.  First, we note that in this\n\ncase we are  dealing with  a nolo contendere  plea which  was\n\nentered in state  court.  And, it may be  that, since Rule 11\n                \n\ndid not  apply in the  first instance to  the taking of  this\n\nplea, that  provision  of  Rule  11  purporting  to  bar  its\n\nadmission also is inapplicable.  United States v. Guadarrama,\n                                                            \n\n742 F.2d 487, 489 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984).8\n\n                    \n\n7.  Lapinski also contends that admitting the evidence of his\nnolo contendere  plea violated the similar  provision of Fed.\nR. Evid. 410 (Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and\nRelated  Statements)  and  Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(22)  (hearsay\nexception for judgment of previous conviction entered on plea\nof  guilty, but  not  upon plea  of  nolo contendere).    The\nFederal  Rules  of  Evidence  do not  apply  to  a supervised\nrelease  revocation  hearing,  however.    United  States  v.\n                                                         \nPortalla, 985 F.2d at  622; see Fed. R. Evid.  1101(e) (rules\n                               \ninapplicable to  revocation of  probation).   We,  therefore,\nneed not, and do not, address this contention.\n\n8.  Strictly speaking,  Rule 11 prohibits evidence  of a plea\n                                                             \nof  nolo  contendere.     What  was  admitted  at  Lapinski s\n                    \nsupervised release revocation  hearing (without objection, we\nreiterate) was the state court  judgment of conviction.   The\n                                                      \njudgment, however, records that Lapinski was convicted upon a\nplea of nolo contendere and the government s attorney, at the\nrevocation hearing, also initiated the first reference to the\nplea  in  his  examination  of Sergeant  Hazel.    Lapinski s\ncounsel,  thereafter, referred  to it  in his  examination of\nLapinski.  Because  we conclude  that error, if  any, in  the\n                                               (continued...)\n\n                             -12-\n\n     In any event, the  revocation of supervised release does\n\nnot require  a conviction  of a separate  federal, state,  or\n\nlocal crime.   Indeed, a violation of  the standard condition\n\nof  supervised release  - that a  defendant shall  not commit\n\nanother federal, state, or local crime - may be found whether\n\nor  not  the defendant  has been  the  subject of  a separate\n\nfederal,  state,  or  local  prosecution  for  such  conduct.\n\nU.S.S.G.  7B1.1, comment. (n.1).  And, the district court did\n\nnot purport  to base the revocation  of Lapinski s supervised\n\nrelease  on   his  plea  of  nolo   contendere  or  resulting\n\nconviction.  Rather, the  district court expressly found that\n\nLapinski committed second degree  sexual assault based on Ms.\n\nGarafola s sworn statement and its conclusion that Lapinski s\n\ntestimony to  the contrary  was not  credible.   The district\n\ncourt   has   \"broad  legal   power   to   determine  witness\n\ncredibility,\" United States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d at 622, and\n                                       \n\nthe  evidence   cited  amply  supports  the   finding,  by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that Lapinski committed second\n\ndegree sexual assault.   Any error  in admitting evidence  of\n\n                    \n\n8.  (...continued)\nadmission of the  evidence of the  nolo contendere plea,  was\nharmless, we assume, without  deciding, that the admission of\nthe judgment of conviction was, in this  case, the equivalent\n                          \nof  the admission of evidence  of a plea  of nolo contendere.\nBut cf. Myers v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 893 F.2d\n                                                   \n840, 843  (6th Cir. 1990) (holding  that Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11\nand Fed. R.

Even had the revocation  of supervised release been based\non Lapinski s  state court conviction (and,  further assuming\nthat the admission of that state court judgment was not plain\nerror), a challenge to that conviction in this proceeding may\nwell have  been inappropriate.   \"Obviously a  parolee cannot\nrelitigate issues determined against  him in other forums, as\nin the situation  presented when the  revocation is based  on\nconviction of another crime.\"   Morrissey v.

Even if  appropriate,  the  challenge would  be\nunsuccessful  based,  as it  was,  only  on Lapinski s  self-\nserving statement,  rejected as not credible  by the district\ncourt, that his nolo contendere plea was involuntary.\n\n                             -14-\n\nCir. 1993) (stating that  Fed. R. Crim. P.  32.1 incorporates\n\nthe Morrissey minimum due process requisites and applies them\n             \n\nto a supervised release revocation hearing).\n\n     Although   Lapinski  objected  to  the  August  7  sworn\n\nstatement as  stale,10 he  did not  complain in  the district\n\ncourt  specifically of a lack of  opportunity to confront and\n\ncross-examine Ms. Garafola.   And, he offered no challenge to\n\nthe government s  explanation that  it had not  presented Ms.\n\nGarafola because it  was unable  to locate her.   On  appeal,\n\nLapinski points  to the Rule  32.1(a)(2) advisory committee s\n\nnote, wherein it  states that \"the probationer does  not have\n\nto  specifically   request  the  right  to  confront  adverse\n\nwitnesses.\"   Notwithstanding  the  existence  of this  right\n\nindependent  of a  request,  we do  not  think that  Lapinski\n\nreasonably can  stand mute below and  then premise reversible\n\nerror per se  on this  ground.  We,  therefore, shall  review\n\nthis claim for plain error only.\n\n     We find  none.   Morrissey and  Gagnon  (as extended  by\n                                           \n\ncaselaw to the revocation  of supervised release) provide one\n\nin Lapinski s position with some right to confront and cross-\n                                \n\nexamine an  adverse witness.  But,  the revocation proceeding\n\n                    \n\n10.  The  August  7, 1991  statement recited  encounters with\nLapinski in May 1991, the June 8, 1991 assault, and a further\nencounter on June  12, 1991.   Counsel s  complaint that  the\nAugust 1991 statement was stale apparently refers not  to the\ninterval  between May and August of 1991, but to the interval\nbetween August 1991 and the June 1992 revocation hearing.\n\n                             -15-\n\nis not the equivalent  of a criminal prosecution.

The  district  court in  a\n          \n\nsupervised release revocation  hearing may consider \"evidence\n\nincluding  letters, affidavits, and other material that would\n\nnot  be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\"  Id.; see\n                                                             \n\nalso United  States v.

Lapinski  claims to be  prejudiced from the  lack of Ms.\nGarafola s live testimony because such testimony, he says, is\nmore reliable,  i.e., the  willingness to testify  falsely is\nimpaired when the witness  is under oath and in  the presence\nof  the  accused.   The  first  part  of  this contention  is\npremised on  his companion  contention that Ms.  Garafola had\nmade  no  statement  under  oath.    We  have  rejected  that\n        \ncontention,  supra  at  note  3.   And,  even  accepting  the\n                  \npreference  for  face-to-face  confrontation,   as  discussed\ninfra, the  government s explanation  for her absence  at the\n     \nrevocation hearing is credible and unchallenged.\n\n                             -16-\n\nSee, e.g., United States  v. Simmons, 812 F.2d 561,  564 (9th\n                                    \n\nCir. 1987); United  States v.

The government  stated that it  did not present\n\nMs. Garafola at the revocation  hearing because it was unable\n\nto locate her.  Given her  residence at a shelter at the time\n\nof  the reported  incident,  this  explanation is  inherently\n\ncredible.  Indeed, even  on appeal, Lapinski suggests nothing\n\nwhich would cast doubt on that statement.\n\n     We focus, therefore, on  the reliability of the evidence\n\nwhich  the government offered in place of Ms. Garafola s live\n\ntestimony.

The  bulk  of  Lapinski s  argument  on  appeal  appears\ndirected at the August 7 sworn statement.  To the extent that\nhis brief reference to the unreliability of police reports is\nintended  as  an  attack on  the  admission  of  the June  12\ncriminal complaint,  it is  unavailing.

Even apart from this,  the statement\n\nwas quite detailed:   it related a series of  encounters with\n\nthe same man  over a period of  months; it provided the  name\n\n\"John\"  that  the man  had  disclosed  during  one  of  these\n\nencounters and  the license  plate number of  John Lapinski s\n\ncar;  it  recorded  Ms.  Garafola s  identification  of  John\n\nLapinski  from   a  photo  spread;  and   it  recounted  with\n\nparticularity  the time, place, and description of the June 8\n\nattack.

The\ndifferences  in description  were pointed  out  by Lapinski s\ncounsel at the hearing.   Having found sufficient  indicia of\nreliability to support the  admission of the sworn statement,\nthere  was no plain  error in the  unobjected-to admission of\nthe essentially duplicative June 12 criminal complaint.\n\n                             -18-\n\n(4th Cir.)

But, he conceded that he\n\nhad spent the  better part of  the months of  May, June,  and\n\nJuly  1991 approaching women in that same localized area.  He\n\nconceded that at least  one of the women that he  had \"found\"\n\nlived at  the  shelter.   And,  although  he  denied  knowing\n\nwhether  the incident  involved  Ms. Garafola,  he, in  fact,\n\nadmitted that, in one instance, he had pulled over in his car\n\nto talk  to one  woman  he had  spotted on  the  side of  the\n\nstreet.    Given the  district  court s  broad discretion  to\n\ndecide the  reliability of hearsay information, United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Of  course, the  reliability of  the sworn  statement is\nfurther buttressed by Lapinski s conviction.  Even were we to\ncredit  Lapinski s  argument  against the  admission  of this\nconviction,  nonetheless, as the  text indicates,  there were\nother  sufficient  indicia  of  reliability  to  support  the\nadmission  of  the  sworn  statement  into  evidence  at  the\nrevocation hearing.\n\n                             -19-\n",

The  appellant, John Lapinski,  appeals an\n               \n\norder of the  district court revoking his term  of supervised\n\nrelease and imposing an  18 month term of incarceration.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  1989, Lapinski  pled  guilty, in  the United  States\n\nDistrict  Court for the Southern  District of Florida, to one\n\ncount  of knowingly  and  with intent  to defraud  possessing\n\nfifteen  or more unauthorized  access devices [credit cards],\n\nin  violation of 18 U.S.C.   1029(a)(3).  He was sentenced to\n\na  27  month term  of  imprisonment  and  a  3 year  term  of\n\nsupervised  release.   Among  the  conditions  applicable  to\n\nLapinski s term of supervised  release was the standard that,\n\nwhile  on supervised  release,  he shall  not commit  another\n\nfederal, state, or local crime.\n\n     Upon his  release from  prison, Lapinski moved  to Rhode\n\nIsland  and his  supervision  was transferred  to the  United\n\nStates Probation  Department there.  In 1991, he was arrested\n\nand charged with  2 counts  of sexual assault  in the  second\n\ndegree.   In February 1992,  Lapinski entered a  plea of nolo\n\ncontendere  to the  reduced  charges of  2  counts of  simple\n\nassault.  He was sentenced to  a 1 year term of imprisonment,\n\nsuspended, and placed on probation for 1 year.\n\n     Shortly thereafter, at the request of Lapinski s federal\n\nprobation officer in Rhode Island, jurisdiction over Lapinski\n\nwas transferred from the Southern District  of Florida to the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island where a supervised release violation\n\nhearing  was  held  on  June  29, 1992.    See  18  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n3583(e)(3).\n\n                             II.\n\n     Lapinski  was represented  by counsel  at the  violation\n\nhearing,  where the  government presented  2 witnesses  and 5\n\nexhibits.  The  exhibits were  (1) a June  12, 1991  criminal\n\ncomplaint   report  filed  by   Collene  Garafola   with  the\n\nMiddletown, Rhode Island Police  Department, (2) an August 7,\n\n1991 sworn statement of Ms. Garafola, (3) a certified copy of\n\nthe judgment  of conviction from  the State of  Rhode Island,\n\n(4)  a copy of the  judgment of conviction  from the Southern\n\nDistrict of Florida, and (5) a copy of the presentence report\n\nin  the Florida case.   The witnesses were  Sergeant Hazel of\n\nthe Middletown Police Department and United  States Probation\n\nOfficer Kurt O Sullivan.1\n\n     In the criminal complaint report filed on June 12, 1991,\n\nMs. Garafola recited  that, on that  day, while walking  from\n\nLucy s  Hearth2 to a 7  Eleven store, she saw  a man in a car\n\nstopped at a light.  The  man then parked the car and watched\n\n                    \n\n1.  As Lapinski  raises no issues regarding  the testimony of\nProbation Officer O Sullivan  or the admission into  evidence\nof the Florida judgment or  related presentence report, we do\nnot discuss them further.\n\n2.  Lucy s  Hearth is a  shelter for women,  located near St.\nLucy s Church, in Middletown.\n\n                             -3-\n\nher.  As she was making a  phone call, the man drove his  car\n\nback to  the store,  got out,  and stood near  the glass  and\n\nwatched her.   The  man then  drove away.   She  reported the\n\nlicense plate number of the car and stated that this same man\n\nhad been harassing her and  several other residents of Lucy s\n\nHearth.   She described what he was wearing and reported that\n\nhe was white,  approximately 25-26 years  of age, 5 9\"  tall,\n\nthin, with  a  light complexion,  dirty blond  hair and  blue\n\neyes.   She  reported that  she believed  his first  name was\n\nJohn.\n\n     She also reported  that this same man had  assaulted her\n\noutside that  same store, four  days earlier, on June  8.  He\n\nran up behind her, grabbed her by the back of  the shirt, and\n\nturned her around.  He then  grabbed her buttocks and put one\n\nof his hands up her shirt, touching her breast.  She reported\n\nthat she kneed him in the groin and ran back to the shelter.\n\n     Sergeant Hazel testified that  this complaint was a true\n\nand accurate copy of the complaint filed by Ms. Garafola.  He\n\nalso  testified  that,  in investigating  this  complaint, he\n\ninterviewed Ms. Garafola and took a sworn statement from her.\n\nIn the  sworn statement of  August 73, Ms.  Garafola reported\n\n                    \n\n3.  Lapinski insists that this August 7 statement is unsworn.\nBut, Lapinski did not  object to the statement on  the ground\nthat  it  was unsworn.   \"Absent  plain  error, an  issue not\npresented  to  the district  court cannot  be raised  for the\nfirst time on appeal.\"   United States v.

He said that he lived  across the street\n\nand asked whether there were any single women there who would\n\nbe willing to move in  with him.  He asked her  name, whether\n\nshe had a  boyfriend or children, and  told her that she  was\n\nbeautiful.    She  walked  away.    A  week  later,  the  man\n\nreappeared in  his car as she was walking to the shelter.  He\n\nasked  whether she  had spoken  to any  women at  the shelter\n\nabout his offer.  Ms. Garafola told him that she had not said\n\nanything and left.\n\n                    \n\n3.

Sergeant  Hazel testified\nthat he  reviewed  the accuracy  of  the statement  with  Ms.\nGarafola,  advised her  of the penalties  of perjury  and the\nconsequences   of  filing   a   false   police  report,   and\nadministered the oath to  her.  This would seem  to establish\nthat, in fact, the  statement was a sworn  statement, despite\nLapinski s  present   objection  that  it  lacked  a  written\nrecitation  thereon that  it  was signed  under penalties  of\nperjury.  See Peters v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284019\"><a href=\"/opinion/284019/james-alvin-peters-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 (Ct.\n                                     \nCl. 1969) (holding that the absence of the formal requirement\nof a notarization in sworn affidavits did  not invalidate the\nstatements  or  render  them  inadmissible  since  they  were\nactually  sworn to  before an  officer who was  authorized to\nadminister an oath and who testified at subsequent hearing to\nthe procedures followed).  Thus, there was no error, plain or\notherwise, in the characterization  of the August 7 statement\nas sworn and, like both parties and the court below, we shall\naccept it as such.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     The sworn statement also  described the assault in June.\n\nThe description of the assault in the sworn statement was, in\n\nall respects, consistent  with the description of  the June 8\n\nassault  in  the previously-filed  criminal  complaint.   The\n\ndescription of the assailant  differed slightly, however.  In\n\nher sworn statement, Ms.  Garafola described her assailant as\n\nwhite, around  6  tall,  thin, with  medium skin tone,  light\n\nbrown hair, and said that he \"might have\" blue eyes.\n\n     In addition,  Sergeant Hazel testified that he had run a\n\ncheck of the  license plate number  reported by Ms.  Garafola\n\nand  it was registered to  John Angelico.4   He presented Ms.\n\nGarafola with an array  of 6 photographs.  He  testified that\n\nshe selected Lapinski s photograph as that of the man who had\n\nassaulted her and stated to him that she was 100 percent sure\n\nof  that fact.   In  her sworn  statement, Ms.  Garafola also\n\nreported that she was positive that the man in the photograph\n\nshe selected was the man who had assaulted her.\n\n     Lapinski s  counsel raised no objection to the admission\n\nof the June 12 criminal complaint or to the certified copy of\n\nthe  Rhode Island judgment of conviction.  He objected to the\n\nadmission  of the  August 7,  1991 sworn  statement as  being\n\nstale.  That objection  was overruled.  On cross-examination,\n\nSergeant Hazel conceded that he  had not taken Ms. Garafola s\n\n                    \n\n4.  It is undisputed that  John Angelico is an alias  of John\nLapinski.\n\n                             -6-\n\noriginal  statement  of   June  12  and  Lapinski s   counsel\n\nhighlighted the differing descriptions of the assailant given\n\nby Ms. Garafola in her two statements.\n\n     Lapinski also testified.  He stated that he had a common\n\nlaw  wife, with whom  he had been  living for 8  years, and 1\n\nchild.  He further stated that he  recalled seeing a woman in\n\nfront of  the 7 Eleven store  in June 1991.   She looked like\n\nshe was  crying.  He pulled  over in his car to  talk to her.\n\nShe  said she had  a problem with her  boyfriend and that she\n\nwas staying at a shelter.  He told her  his name and that, if\n\nshe ever needed  anything, he  lived across the  street.   He\n\nremained  in his car the  entire time.   The stoplight turned\n\ngreen;  he drove  away and  never spoke  to  her again.   The\n\nexchange lasted perhaps 1 or 2 minutes.\n\n     His counsel  further inquired, \"Were you  trying to pick\n\nher  up?\"  Lapinski answered,  \"Yeah. ... well  not trying to\n\npick  her up so much, but more to, you know to make a friend.\n\nI mean, I,  you know, try to be friendly  with as many people\n\nas I can.\"   Lapinski stated that, although he never spoke to\n\nher  again, she  may have  seen him  because, in  addition to\n\nliving across the street  from the 7 Eleven store,  he worked\n\nin  an apartment complex next door to that store and traveled\n\nback and forth many times daily.  He also testified variously\n\nthat he was \"about 6 2\"\" and \"probably 6 2 \" maybe.  Almost 6\n\nfeet,  close  to  it.\"    He  testified  that  he  pled  nolo\n\n                             -7-\n\ncontendere to simple assault on counsel s  advice that he had\n\nno other choice, but  that he never had any  physical contact\n\nwith Ms. Garafola.\n\n     On cross-examination, Lapinski testified  that, although\n\nhe  recalled speaking  to a  woman in  front of the  7 Eleven\n\nstore in May, June, or July  1991, he did not recall what she\n\nlooked  like or  know whether  the incident  involved Collene\n\nGarafola.  He  did recall  that the road  was extremely  busy\n\nwith  traffic and that  one had to  be alert  because of cars\n\npulling in and  out of  the traffic lanes.   Nonetheless,  he\n\nobserved a  woman looking  depressed and leaning  against the\n\nbus stop on the side of the road.\n\n     The following exchange also occurred:\n\nDiGioia5:      Isn t  it  true  that you ve  been  trying  to\n               pick up,  if you will, young  ladies who lived\n               in that shelter --\n\nLapinski:      Well --\n\nDiGioia:       the better part of the month of May, June, and\n               July?\n\nLapinski:      Yes, I  talked to a few women on the -- in the\n               area,  and one  other  one I  found that  also\n               lives in the shelter.\n\nDiGioia:       And isn t  it true that  you were specifically\n               looking for  women who  looked like  they came\n               from the shelter?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.

Anthony DiGioia was the government s attorney.\n\n                             -8-\n\nDiGioia:       Isn t it true  that you  would approach  these\n               women and ask them if they would come  to live\n               with you just for cooking and cleaning?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.   I never  asked them to  -- if  they\n               wanted to cook and cleaning [sic].\n\nDiGioia:       Now, did you  every [sic]  approach any  young\n               lady down there, in  that vicinity and ask her\n               to come stay with you, and  make a motion down\n               towards, towards your pants, a motion as if to\n               indicate masturbating?\n\nLapinski:      No, sir.\n\nDiGioia:       Never did anything like that?\n\nLapinski:      No. Why?  That s senseless.\n\nDiGioia:       That s senseless?  Your only approach to these\n               young  women was that you were concerned about\n               trying  to  help   them  out,  is  that   your\n               testimony?\n\nLapinski:      Not concerned  about trying to help  them out.\n               But,  you know,  concerned about  maybe taking\n               them  for a,  for a  dinner, or  for a  drink.\n               That s it.  I mean  I m not a -- in the  paper\n               they  made it look like a maniac I jump out of\n               a  car and I beat somebody up for what reason?\n               I don t  understand.  What s the  -- you know,\n               in front of millions of people -- not millions\n               of people, but at  least hundreds of people in\n               shopping   plaza,  next   door.      I   don t\n               understand.\n\n     Lapinski testified that  he had no  choice but to  plead\n\nnolo contendere because, he  said, his retained counsel would\n\nno  longer represent him without an additional fee.  He never\n\ninformed the state  court that he  could not afford  counsel.\n\nHe said that he tried to tell the judge  that he wanted to go\n\nto  trial but could not afford counsel, but that his attorney\n\n                             -9-\n\n\"kept elbowing  me in the  side saying,  \"No.   No.\"\" and  he\n\nnever had the chance to tell his side of the story.\n\n     The  district  court found  by  a  preponderance of  the\n\nevidence that  Lapinski  committed  a  second  degree  sexual\n\nassault  on  or about  June 8,  1991,  in violation  of Rhode\n\nIsland General Laws    11-37-4 and 5  and in violation of the\n\nconditions  of his supervised release.6   The court found the\n\n\"vivid\"  account  of  the  incident contained  in  the  sworn\n\nstatement  to  be  credible.     Further,  Ms.  Garafola  had\n\ndescribed Lapinski and his automobile and  had picked out his\n\nphotograph  from the  array.   The  court found  not credible\n\nLapinski s  testimony that he stopped at the side of the road\n\n                    \n\n6.  Lapinski pled  nolo contendere  to the lesser  charges of\nsimple assault.  However,\n          [u]nder  18  U.S.C.       3563(a)(1)  and\n          3583(d),   a   mandatory   condition   of\n          probation and supervised release  is that\n          the defendant not commit another federal,\n          state,  or local crime.   A  violation of\n          this condition may be charged  whether or\n          not the defendant has been the subject of\n          a  separate  federal,  state,   or  local\n          prosecution for such conduct.   The grade\n          of  violation  does not  depend  upon the\n          conduct that  is the subject  of criminal\n          charges  or  of  which  the  defendant is\n          convicted   in  a   criminal  proceeding.\n          Rather, the grade of the violation is  to\n          be  based  on   the  defendant's   actual\n          conduct.\nU.S.S.G.  7B1.1, comment.

First, we note that in this\n\ncase we are  dealing with  a nolo contendere  plea which  was\n\nentered in state  court.  And, it may be  that, since Rule 11\n                \n\ndid not  apply in the  first instance to  the taking of  this\n\nplea, that  provision  of  Rule  11  purporting  to  bar  its\n\nadmission also is inapplicable.

Guadarrama,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440397\"><a href=\"/opinion/440397/united-states-v-jose-guadarrama/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984).8\n\n                    \n\n7.  Lapinski also contends that admitting the evidence of his\nnolo contendere  plea violated the similar  provision of Fed.\nR. Evid. 410 (Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and\nRelated  Statements)  and  Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(22)  (hearsay\nexception for judgment of previous conviction entered on plea\nof  guilty, but  not  upon plea  of  nolo contendere).    The\nFederal  Rules  of  Evidence  do not  apply  to  a supervised\nrelease  revocation  hearing,  however.    United  States  v.\n                                                         \nPortalla, 985 F.2d at  622; see Fed. R. Evid.  1101(e) (rules\n                               \ninapplicable to  revocation of  probation).   We,  therefore,\nneed not, and do not, address this contention.\n\n8.  Strictly speaking,  Rule 11 prohibits evidence  of a plea\n                                                             \nof  nolo  contendere.     What  was  admitted  at  Lapinski s\n                    \nsupervised release revocation  hearing (without objection, we\nreiterate) was the state court  judgment of conviction.   The\n                                                      \njudgment, however, records that Lapinski was convicted upon a\nplea of nolo contendere and the government s attorney, at the\nrevocation hearing, also initiated the first reference to the\nplea  in  his  examination  of Sergeant  Hazel.    Lapinski s\ncounsel,  thereafter, referred  to it  in his  examination of\nLapinski.  Because  we conclude  that error, if  any, in  the\n                                               (continued...)\n\n                             -12-\n\n     In any event, the  revocation of supervised release does\n\nnot require  a conviction  of a separate  federal, state,  or\n\nlocal crime.   Indeed, a violation of  the standard condition\n\nof  supervised release  - that a  defendant shall  not commit\n\nanother federal, state, or local crime - may be found whether\n\nor  not  the defendant  has been  the  subject of  a separate\n\nfederal,  state,  or  local  prosecution  for  such  conduct.\n\nU.S.S.G.  7B1.1, comment. (n.1).  And, the district court did\n\nnot purport  to base the revocation  of Lapinski s supervised\n\nrelease  on   his  plea  of  nolo   contendere  or  resulting\n\nconviction.  Rather, the  district court expressly found that\n\nLapinski committed second degree  sexual assault based on Ms.\n\nGarafola s sworn statement and its conclusion that Lapinski s\n\ntestimony to  the contrary  was not  credible.   The district\n\ncourt   has   \"broad  legal   power   to   determine  witness\n\ncredibility,\" United States v.

And,  although  he  denied  knowing\n\nwhether  the incident  involved  Ms. Garafola,  he, in  fact,\n\nadmitted that, in one instance, he had pulled over in his car\n\nto talk  to one  woman  he had  spotted on  the  side of  the\n\nstreet.    Given the  district  court s  broad discretion  to\n\ndecide the  reliability of hearsay information, United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Portalla, 985  F.2d at 623,  we find no  plain error and,\n            \n\ntherefore, no  violation of Lapinski s right  to confront and\n\ncross-examine  witnesses,  in  the  admission  of  the  sworn\n\nstatement into evidence at the revocation hearing.13\n\n     The order of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n13.  Of  course, the  reliability of  the sworn  statement is\nfurther buttressed by Lapinski s conviction.  Even were we to\ncredit  Lapinski s  argument  against the  admission  of this\nconviction,  nonetheless, as the  text indicates,  there were\nother  sufficient  indicia  of  reliability  to  support  the\nadmission  of  the  sworn  statement  into  evidence  at  the\nrevocation hearing.\n\n                             -19-\n</pre>",
