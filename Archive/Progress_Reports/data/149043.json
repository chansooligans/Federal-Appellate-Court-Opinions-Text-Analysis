Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Douglas W.

In November 2006 the Real Estate Bar\n\nAssociation for Massachusetts, Inc. (\"REBA\") brought suit in state\n\ncourt against National Real Estate Information Services, Inc.,\n\nlater    also   naming   National   Real    Estate    Information    Services\n\n(collectively \"NREIS\"), as REBA was given standing to do as a bar\n\nassociation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B.                 REBA sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that certain activities\n\nNREIS engaged in constituted the unauthorized practice of law under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A.        Those activities stemmed from\n\nNREIS's provision of real estate settlement services and its\n\nbusiness as a title insurance agent.\n\n            NREIS removed the case to federal district court on\n\ndiversity grounds.        The district court proved inhospitable to\n\nREBA's    claims.        Although   the     Supreme    Judicial     Court   of\n\nMassachusetts (\"SJC\") had never opined on these modern conveyancing\n\npractices by nonlawyers and had last addressed the general topic of\n\nconveyancing in 1935, the district court construed the sparse state\n\ncase law and declared the practices at issue did not constitute the\n\nunauthorized practice of law.       The district court entered judgment\n\nagainst REBA on its suit.       See Real Estate Bar Ass'n for Mass.,\n\nInc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs. (REBA I), 609 F. Supp. 2d\n\n135, 143-44 (D. Mass. 2009).\n\n            The district court went further and issued injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief against the bar association, finding for NREIS\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fon its purported counterclaim, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that\n\nREBA's very bringing of the lawsuit in state court had violated the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause.        Id. at 147.      The court then ordered REBA\n\nto pay attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $904,076.17 to\n\nNREIS as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.                   Real Estate\n\nBar Ass'n for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs. (REBA\n\nII), 642 F. Supp. 2d 58, 73 (D. Mass. 2009).\n\n           REBA appeals from the district court's summary judgment\n\nrulings and is supported by amicus briefs from two major bar\n\nassociations in Massachusetts.          The Massachusetts Bar Association\n\nargues the district court was wrong in finding there was no\n\nviolation of the unauthorized-practice-of-law statute.                 The Boston\n\nBar Association argues that the issuance of the injunction and\n\ndeclaratory relief against REBA for having brought suit violated\n\nthe First Amendment.     REBA also requests this court to certify to\n\nthe SJC the unauthorized-practice-of-law question that is the\n\nsubject of its suit and to reverse all relief against it on the\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n           We vacate the district court's judgment against REBA on\n\nits unauthorized-practice-of-law claim.                In Massachusetts, the\n\nstate   judicial    branch,   and   the    SJC   in    particular,     is    solely\n\nresponsible   for    defining    what     is   the    practice   of   law.     See\n\nSuperadio Ltd. P'ship v. Winstar Radio Prods., LLC, 844 N.E.2d 246,\n\n250 (Mass. 2006) (\"[T]he judicial department is necessarily the\n\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\fsole arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law. . . .\")\n\n(quoting Lowell Bar Ass'n v. Loeb, 52 N.E.2d 27, 31 (Mass. 1943)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Opinion of the\n\nJustices, 194 N.E. 313, 316 (Mass. 1935).             Because there is no\n\ncontrolling precedent from the SJC which addresses whether NREIS's\n\nvarious activities constitute the unauthorized practice of law and\n\nbecause   the   answer   to   that   question   is    unclear    and   may   be\n\ndeterminative of this litigation, we certify that question to the\n\nSJC.   See Mass. S.J.C. Rule 1:03; Ropes & Gray LLP v. Jalbert (In\n\nre Engage, Inc.), 544 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           We also reverse the district court's decision on NREIS's\n\ndormant   Commerce   Clause    counterclaim.         Without    reaching     the\n\nquestion of whether a defendant may assert as a counterclaim that\n\nthe plaintiff is relying on an unconstitutional statute, we hold\n\nthat issuance of relief here was improper.             REBA is not a state\n\nactor, NREIS has not stated a dormant Commerce Clause claim against\n\nREBA, and REBA's bringing of its suit against NREIS under Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B is protected by the First Amendment of the\n\nUnited States Constitution.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           We present the essential facts giving rise to this\n\ncontroversy which, unless otherwise indicated, are uncontested.\n\n           The underlying legal dispute in this case is whether the\n\nactivities required to transfer title in real estate and to issue\n\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\finsurance policies on the transfer of title in whole or in part\n\nconstitute the practice of law.           While the parties disagree as to\n\nwhat specific activities are required to transfer title, they\n\ngenerally agree that these transactions involve an inspection of\n\nthe seller's legal title to the real estate before the transfer\n\nand, if necessary, resolution of any flaws in the seller's title to\n\nthe property; execution of legal documents and the exchange of\n\nthose documents and promised consideration at a \"closing;\" and\n\nrecording of the legal documents at the registry of deeds.\n\n              Title insurance policies are issued at the time of\n\nclosing by title insurance agents, who are independent of the title\n\ninsurance company, either to insure the owner or purchaser's\n\ninterest in the real estate or to insure the interest of the\n\nmortgage lender.        These policies incorporate an inspection of the\n\ntitle at the time of the closing, and any unresolved defects,\n\nliens,   or    encumbrances    on   the   property   may   be   identified     as\n\nexceptions to the policy.\n\n              REBA, formerly known as the Massachusetts Conveyancers'\n\nAssociation,     Inc.,    is   a   150-year-old    bar   association    with    a\n\nmembership      of   approximately     3,000   Massachusetts     real   estate\n\nattorneys.      REBA's website describes its members as representing\n\n\"lenders, buyers, sellers, owners, landlords and tenants in every\n\nreal estate practice area and specialty including resolving title\n\nissues   and    title    insurance,   commercial     leasing,   transactional\n\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\fmatters for both residential and commercial property, affordable\n\nhousing,        environmental,    zoning,     permitting       and    land    use,\n\nalternative dispute resolution and litigation.\"                 Real Estate Bar\n\nAssociation              of      Massachusetts,               About          REBA,\n\nhttp://www.reba.net/page/about (last visited June 3, 2010).                   It is\n\nnot an integrated bar,1 nor has the SJC delegated to it the\n\nresolution of questions about what is the unauthorized practice of\n\nlaw.\n\n              NREIS is a Pennsylvania-based corporation that provides\n\nreal estate closing (which NREIS also calls \"vendor management\")\n\nand     title     insurance-related     services    for       mortgage     lenders\n\nthroughout the country.          It is a member of the Title/Appraisal\n\nVendor      Management    Association     (\"TAVMA\"),      a     national     trade\n\nassociation of companies providing real estate closing services.\n\nNREIS's customers are mostly national mortgage loan companies.\n\nNREIS      provides   these   companies     with   centralized       back-office\n\noperations in support of their lending transactions.                  Aside from\n\nthird-party lawyers with whom NREIS contracts to attend closings,\n\nNREIS does not employ any lawyers to provide its services.                   NREIS\n\nasserts that it does not hold itself out to its customers as\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          \"An 'integrated' bar is an association of attorneys in\nwhich membership and dues are required as a condition of practicing\nlaw in the jurisdiction.\" Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de\nPuerto Rico, 917 F.2d 620, 623 n.1 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\fpracticing law or having the ability or qualifications to practice\n\nlaw.\n\n          REBA has a history of attempting to curtail what it calls\n\n\"witness\" or \"notary\" real estate closings, in which all of the\n\ndocuments required to complete a real estate transaction are\n\ncompiled by nonlawyer third parties and an attorney only witnesses\n\nthe closing of the transaction.\n\n          REBA believes that the essential tasks involved in a real\n\nestate transaction are an \"interconnected series of activities that\n\nmust be performed in order to convey the various legal interests in\n\n. . . real estate,\" and each of the activities must be overseen, if\n\nnot personally conducted, by an attorney.      REBA's position is that\n\nsome mechanical tasks, such as creating title abstracts, may be\n\ndelegated to nonattorneys, so long as \"the lawyer maintains a\n\ndirect relationship with the client, supervises the delegated work,\n\nand has responsibility for the work product.\"       REBA also alleges\n\nthat the issuing of title insurance policies is the practice of law\n\nbecause   title   insurance   policies   are   issued   based   on   the\n\nexamination and legal analysis of the seller's legal title in the\n\nproperty, which REBA asserts must be conducted by an attorney.\n\n          Consistent with its views, REBA has opposed bills in the\n\nlegislature that would formally recognize witness closings in\n\nMassachusetts and has tried to persuade affiliated bar associations\n\nto petition the SJC to adopt, through rulemaking, REBA's own\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fdefinition of the practice of law into the Massachusetts Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct. REBA also filed and won two lawsuits in 1993\n\nand 2001 in Massachusetts Superior Court to enjoin local companies,\n\nnot run by lawyers, from providing real estate settlement services.\n\nSee Mass. Conveyancers Assoc., Inc. v. Colonial Title & Escrow,\n\nInc., No. Civ. 96-2746-C, 2001 WL 669280 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2001)\n\n(finding the defendant corporation engaged in unauthorized practice\n\nof law and enjoining the defendant from, inter alia, evaluating\n\ntitle and closing agreements, drafting legal documents, explaining\n\nlegal documents at closing, and issuing title insurance policies\n\nbased on the defendant's title evaluations); Mass. Assoc. of Bank\n\nCounsel, Inc. v. Closings, LTD, No. 903053C, 1993 WL 818916, at *2\n\n(Mass.   Super.   Ct.   1993)    (granting   default   judgment,   finding\n\ndefendant engaged in unauthorized practice of law and enjoining\n\ndefendant from drafting instruments related to real estate and\n\ngiving advice in connection with real estate closings, as well as\n\n\"handling   all   aspects   of   residential   real    estate   closings\").\n\nNeither decision was appealed to the SJC.        This suit, REBA hoped,\n\nwould ultimately result in an authoritative judgment by the SJC on\n\nthese continuing issues.\n\n            NREIS both provides real estate closing services and acts\n\nas a title insurance agent in Massachusetts.               In helping to\n\ncoordinate a real estate closing, NREIS, at the lender's request,\n\nmay provide any of the following services in Massachusetts: (1)\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fobtaining valuations of a property and third-party reports such as\n\ntax certifications and flood reports; (2) obtaining title searches\n\nfrom a third-party vendor; (3) drafting the settlement statement;\n\n(4) scheduling the closing with a Massachusetts attorney who will\n\nattend and transmitting the lender's documents to that attorney for\n\nthe closing; (5) disbursing settlement funds, held by NREIS in its\n\nown   bank   account    until   the     mortgage   has    been   executed    by   a\n\nborrower; and (6) ensuring that the transaction documents were\n\ncompleted properly and properly recorded.                NREIS describes these\n\nactivities as administrative and not legal.\n\n             The title search is conducted by a third-party vendor\n\nunder contract to NREIS.        One of those companies, Connelly Title,\n\nitself does not employ any lawyers and purports only to provide\n\ntitle abstracting services and no legal analysis.                NREIS does not\n\nconduct its own review of the title abstract provided by Connelly\n\nTitle.\n\n             When a lender-customer requests that NREIS provide a deed\n\nfor a transaction, NREIS contracts with another third-party vendor,\n\na Las Vegas, Nevada-based company.          That company is not a law firm.\n\n             As   to   the   closings    themselves,     NREIS   schedules    the\n\nclosing to be attended by a Massachusetts attorney, selected from\n\na list it maintains of around seventy-four lawyers.                  Before the\n\nclosing, NREIS sends the relevant documents to the attorney. NREIS\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\fdoes not provide any instructions as to how the attorney should\n\nconduct the closing.\n\n            NREIS    also   acts    as    a    title    insurance   agent      on   its\n\ntransactions when requested.          When acting as an agent, NREIS does\n\nnot review the status of the real estate title.                   It prepares the\n\ntitle insurance policy based on a title abstract provided by a\n\nthird-party vendor, simply copying the contents of the abstract\n\ninto the policy documents.               NREIS issues polices for several\n\ncompanies that write title insurance in Massachusetts, including\n\nStewart Title, First American, Ticor Title, and Old Republic.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            REBA filed its original complaint on November 6, 2006,\n\nand its amended complaint on February 2, 2007, in Suffolk County\n\nSuperior Court, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A, and 46B,\n\nseeking declaratory judgment and an injunction against NREIS's\n\nactivities in Massachusetts.             The statute, at § 46 states that\n\naside   from   corporations        established         to    practice   law,    \"[n]o\n\ncorporation or association shall practice or appear as an attorney\n\nfor   any   person   other    than       itself\"   and       explicitly   prohibits\n\ncorporations from drafting legal documents or giving legal advice\n\nnot relating to their own businesses, or holding themselves out to\n\nthe public as being able to practice law.                   Id. § 46.   Section 46A\n\nprovides in pertinent part that \"[n]o individual, other than a\n\nmember, in good standing, of the bar of this commonwealth shall\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fpractice    law,     or,    by       word,    sign,      letter,    advertisement       or\n\notherwise, hold himself out as authorized, entitled, competent,\n\nqualified or able to practice law.\"                 Id. § 46A.\n\n            Section 46B provides concurrent jurisdiction to the SJC\n\nand Massachusetts superior courts to restrain violations of §§ 46,\n\n46A, and 46C \"upon petition of any bar association within the\n\ncommonwealth, or of three or more members of the bar of the\n\ncommonwealth, or of the attorney general, or of the district\n\nattorney within his district.\"                Id. § 46B.\n\n            REBA's amended complaint asserted there was a controversy\n\nas to \"whether Massachusetts law permits a non-lawyer who is not a\n\nparty to a real estate transaction to control and supervise the\n\nconveyance of a legal interest in . . . real property . . . where\n\nthe only participation of an attorney is restricted to notarizing\n\ndocuments   at     the    settlement         of   the    transaction.\"          It   sought\n\ndeclaratory judgment that NREIS was engaged in the unauthorized\n\npractice    of     law.      The       complaint        further    stated   there      was\n\ndisagreement as to whether NREIS could legally contract with\n\nMassachusetts attorneys to provide legal services to third parties.\n\n            REBA    sought       declaratory        judgment       that   \"an    attorney\n\nretained    to     perform       a    conveyance        of   a    legal   interest      in\n\nMassachusetts real property on behalf of a bank or lender must have\n\na direct attorney-client relationship with the bank or mortgage\n\nlender client, and that [NREIS is] not permitted to interpose\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f[itself]    into    that       attorney-client    relationship       or   otherwise\n\ncontrol it.\"      REBA also sought relief in the form of a preliminary\n\nand permanent injunction against NREIS \"engaging in any of the\n\nactivities which constitute a conveyance of real property unless\n\nthey are acting under the supervision or control of a Massachusetts\n\nattorney.\"     REBA did not seek monetary damages.\n\n            On February 6, 2007, NREIS removed the action, under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1441, to the federal district court in Massachusetts on\n\ndiversity grounds.         REBA agreed to dismiss from the original case\n\nthe one nondiverse defendant, a Massachusetts attorney.\n\n            At the same time, NREIS filed in the federal district\n\ncourt an answer to REBA's complaint denying REBA's allegations and\n\nasserting what it styled as a counterclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nThe counterclaim sought (1) declaratory judgment that Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 221, § 46A, \"if interpreted against NREIS as plaintiff\n\ncontends,    violates      the     Dormant     Commerce     Clause   of     the   U.S.\n\nConstitution,\" (2) an injunction against REBA \"preventing NREIS\n\nfrom engaging in interestate commerce free from restrictive state\n\naction,\" and (3) attorney's fees and costs.\n\n                                        III.\n\nA.          Certification of REBA's Claim to the SJC\n\n            We first vacate the district court's entry of judgment\n\nagainst    REBA    on    its    unauthorized-practice-of-law         claim.        The\n\ndistrict    court       interpreted    state    law   and    held    that    NREIS's\n\n\n                                       - 12 -\n\factivities do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law under\n\nMass.

Marsh (In re Hundley), 603 F.3d\n\n95, 98 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"When Massachusetts law is at issue, the\n\nSJC has provided that we may certify questions to it in cases where\n\nwe 'find[] no controlling precedent, and where the questions may be\n\ndeterminative of the pending cause of action.'\") (quoting In re\n\nEngage, Inc., 544 F.3d at 52) (alternation in original).\n\n           The conditions for certification are met. Should the SJC\n\ndecide that the activities NREIS has engaged in do not constitute\n\nthe unauthorized practice of law, that \"may be determinative\" of\n\nthis case.\n\n           There is no controlling precedent from the SJC.                A 1935\n\nopinion of the SJC, In re Opinion of the Justices, notes that the\n\npractice of law \"embraces conveyancing.\"             194 N.E. at 317.           But\n\nthere is no controlling precedent that establishes a definition for\n\n\"conveyancing\"     or   the   extent    of    activities      that   constitute\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fconveyancing. The district court correctly noted that there was no\n\nSJC precedent \"directly on point\" on what activities constituted\n\nconveyancing and that \"the SJC has not explicitly addressed whether\n\nthe practice of law embraces all the interconnected activities of\n\na real estate conveyance.\"   REBA I, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 142-43.      The\n\ndistrict court was also correct to note that state law provided\n\nlittle \"guidance as to the level of involvement an attorney must\n\nhave\" in the conveyancing activities.    Id. at 143.\n\n          Of course, \"even in the absence of controlling precedent,\n\ncertification   would   be   inappropriate   where     state   law    is\n\nsufficiently clear to allow us to predict its course.\"           In re\n\nEngage, Inc., 544 F.3d at 53.      This is not such a case.          The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the statute has not been violated\n\nis at least in tension with the view of the two state trial court\n\ndeterminations in Massachusetts, and perhaps one determination by\n\na single SJC justice.   REBA cites a decision by a single justice in\n\na disciplinary case, In re Eric Levine, No. BD-2002-075, 2004 WL\n\n5214985 (Mass. St. Bar Disp. Bd. 2004), which found a suspended\n\nattorney had engaged in the practice of law when the attorney\n\ncontinued to provide closing services following his suspension,\n\neven though a licensed attorney attended the actual closings.        Id.\n\nat *2.   These opinions, as the district court recognized, are not\n\nopinions of the full SJC and so are not dispositive.      REBA I, 609\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 142.\n\n\n                               - 14 -\n\f           NREIS, in turn, relies on several SJC opinions holding\n\nthat certain other economic activities, such as filling in tax\n\nforms, preparing a reaffirmation form in a bankruptcy proceeding,\n\nand conducting research on real estate titles in the registry of\n\ndeeds and then reporting and making recommendations to a lawyer\n\nbased on the research, did not constitute the practice of law.            See\n\nIn re Chimko, 831 N.E.2d 316, 321-22 (Mass. 2005); Goldblatt v.\n\nCorp. Counsel of Boston, 277 N.E.2d 273, 277 & n.4 (Mass. 1971);\n\nLowell Bar Ass'n, 52 N.E.2d at 34.            None of those authorities is\n\nanalogous to this case, and NREIS itself acknowledges that they do\n\nnot directly address REBA's claim.\n\n           Unlike other certification cases in which there is mere\n\nrisk of error by the federal courts in ruling on state law issues,\n\nsee Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., 529 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n2008),   here   there   are   even   stronger    reasons   to   commit   these\n\nquestions to the SJC in the first instance.         Apart from the lack of\n\ncertainty in state law, it is especially appropriate to certify\n\nthis question to the SJC because whether NREIS's various activities\n\nhere constitute the unauthorized practice of law raises serious\n\npolicy concerns regarding the practice of law that will certainly\n\nimpact future cases.      Such policy judgments are best left to the\n\nSJC, which is responsible for defining the practice of law in\n\nMassachusetts.    See In re Engage, Inc., 544 F.3d at 57; Boston Gas\n\nCo., 529 F.3d at 14-15.\n\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\f           Indeed, the interests of federalism are best served by\n\ncertification. We have been particularly mindful of those concerns\n\nand have certified before when the issues concern the SJC's control\n\nover the practice of law.     E.g., In re Engage, Inc., 544 F.3d at\n\n57-58 (certifying, inter alia, the question of whether a state\n\nattorney   lien     statute   applies     to   \"patents   and   patent\n\napplications\").     Federal law recognizes that states have \"an\n\nespecially great\" interest in regulating the practice of law.\n\nGoldfarb v. Va. State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 792 (1975) (\"The interest\n\nof the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since\n\nlawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of\n\nadministering justice . . . .\").        The authority to regulate the\n\npractice of law has been left to the states \"[s]ince the founding\n\nof the Republic.\"    Leis v. Flynt, 439 U.S. 438, 442 (1979).2\n\n\n     2\n          We note that REBA sought to obtain a ruling in state\ncourt and that its efforts were thwarted by the removal of the case\nto the federal court. REBA did not choose to have the state law\nquestion decided by a federal court.     NREIS made that decision\nthrough removal. The existence of diversity sufficient to permit\nthe exercise of federal jurisdiction is an insufficient reason to\ndeprive the SJC of its normal role as arbiter of what constitutes\nthe practice of law in Massachusetts.\n     NREIS argues that REBA failed to move for certification to the\nSJC in the district court and for that reason we must have a\ncompelling reason to certify. This factor is one of many to be\nconsidered in the exercise of our discretion. See Boston Car Co.,\nInc. v. Acura Auto. Div., Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 971 F.2d 811,\n817 n.3 (1st Cir. 1992).     This court has discretion to certify\nquestions to the SJC when a party fails to move for certification\nin the district court, or to do so sua sponte. Hundley, 603 F.3d\nat 98; In re Engage, Inc., 554 F.3d at 57 n.10; Me. Drilling and\nBlasting, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 34 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994).\nThe arguments for certification in this case are compelling.\n\n                               - 16 -\n\f          There are also strong federalism interests that are\n\nfurthered by providing the state courts with the opportunity to\n\ndecide on underlying unsettled questions of state law.          Cf. Growe\n\nv. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 32 (1993) (noting circumstances in which\n\n\"principles of federalism and comity dictate\" deferring to state\n\ncourts, such as \"when the federal action raises difficult questions\n\nof state law bearing on important matters of state policy\").\n\n          We   therefore   certify   to   the   Massachusetts    SJC    the\n\nfollowing questions:\n\n          1. Whether NREIS's activities, either in whole or in\n\npart, based on the record in this case and as described in the\n\nparties' filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 et seq.\n\n          2.   Whether   NREIS's   activities,    in   contracting     with\n\nMassachusetts attorneys to attend closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 221, §§ 46 et seq.\n\n          We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other\n\nrelevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in\n\nthe proper resolution of the issues.\n\n\n\n\n     NREIS also argues that REBA raises a theory in its petition\nfor certification that REBA did not present to the district court:\nthat the individual steps in a real estate transaction, and not\njust the process as a whole, constitute the practice of law. We\ndecline to reach this question.\n\n                               - 17 -\n\fB.        Issuance of Injunctive and Declaratory Relief against\n          REBA under § 1983 for Violation of the Dormant Commerce\n          Clause Was Error\n\n          The district court also granted summary judgment on\n\nNREIS's counterclaim and issued injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nagainst REBA.3   Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is de novo.    Family Winemakers of Cal. v. Jenkins, 592\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2009).   \"We review a district court's grant of\n\na permanent injunction for abuse of discretion; we review its\n\nunderlying conclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for\n\nclear error.\" Shell Co. (P.R.), Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station,\n\nInc., 605 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n          We bypass the question of whether a defendant may assert\n\nas a counterclaim that a statute if construed to apply would\n\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause.4      Whatever the procedural\n\nvehicle, the theory of the counterclaim as to which injunctive\n\nrelief was granted is not viable for a number of reasons.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          Based upon these findings, the court concluded that NREIS\nwas a prevailing party in a § 1983 action and awarded attorney's\nfees and costs of $904,076.17 against REBA under § 1988. Because\nwe vacate the findings of liability on all theories, NREIS cannot\nbe a prevailing party, and it is not entitled to relief.\n     4\n          The parties have not briefed this question, and so we\nvacate the district court's holding on other grounds. We note,\nhowever, that the assertion that a statute violates the dormant\nCommerce Clause can be and usually is raised as an affirmative\ndefense, as NREIS also did in this case. See, e.g., Sadler v. NCR\nCorp., 928 F.2d 48, 53-56 (2d Cir. 1991).\n\n                               - 18 -\n\f            We start with the ambiguity in NREIS's theory, which\n\nprovided context for the odd configuration of arguments before the\n\ndistrict court.       The counterclaim stated what appeared to be a\n\nconventional defense: that if REBA's interpretation of the state\n\nstatute    were    adopted     by    the    court   then    the      statute,   as    so\n\ninterpreted (presumably by a court), would violate the dormant\n\nCommerce Clause.\n\n            The    counterclaim,       however,     also    alleged     that    \"[t]he\n\nAmended Complaint by plaintiff and its interpretation of [Mass.\n\nGen. Laws. ch. 221, § 46A], is an act of economic protectionism by\n\nMassachusetts       lawyers     against       out-of-state        competition        for\n\nsettlement services.\"          This could be read to allege an unusual\n\ntheory, that the filing of the complaint alleging unauthorized\n\npractice was itself a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n            REBA read the counterclaim to embody the first argument.\n\nIt argued to the district court that the statute, if interpreted by\n\na court to prohibit NREIS's activities, would not violate the\n\ndormant    Commerce    Clause,       thus    interpreting       the    theory    as    a\n\nconventional defense.         Under that argument, if the court did not\n\ninterpret the statute to apply to NREIS's activities, then the\n\nCommerce Clause claim would be hypothetical and not be reached.\n\nNREIS,    however,    argued    it    was    entitled      to   an    injunction     and\n\ndeclaratory relief against REBA, mixing both readings of what its\n\ntheory was.       In a reply brief, NREIS said it sought an injunction\n\n\n                                       - 19 -\n\fbased on REBA's advocacy of its theory in the litigation, the\n\nsecond reading.\n\n                     The district court took up the second theory and enjoined\n\nREBA \"from enforcing on NREIS its interpretation of the practice of\n\nlaw as encompassing (1) all the interconnected activities of a real\n\nestate conveyance and (2) the issuance of title insurance.\"                           REBA\n\nI, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 147 (emphasis added).                    The court held that\n\nNREIS           \"is    entitled     to   a   declaratory    judgment     that    REBA's\n\ninterpretation of the practice of law as encompassing all the\n\ninterconnected steps of a real estate conveyance violates the\n\nDormant Commerce Clause.\"                  Id. (emphasis added).       The court said\n\nits     \"holding             address[ed]     the   constitutionality      of     REBA's\n\ninterpretation of what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law\n\n.   .       .    ,    not    the   constitutionality   of   sections     46     and    46A\n\nthemselves.\"5               Id. at 147 n.91.\n\n                     The district court thus held that REBA's actions in\n\nbringing a suit before a state court seeking an adjudication that\n\ncertain activities violated a state statute were themselves a\n\nviolation of the dormant Commerce Clause.                   More specifically, the\n\n\n        5\n          Indeed, the court could not have ruled on the\nconstitutionality of these provisions of state law because that\nwould, in light of its holding that these provisions were\ninapplicable, have been an advisory opinion, forbidden by Article\nIII. Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir.\n2004) (\"A court cannot hear an action that loses 'its character as\na present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are\nto avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.'\")\n(quoting Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48 (1969) (per curiam)).\n\n                                             - 20 -\n\fcourt held that REBA's advocacy of the particular position in state\n\ncourt    that    NREIS's       activities   violated   the   state   law   was    a\n\nviolation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n            After the court issued the injunction, REBA argued at the\n\nhearing on attorney's fees that there had been nothing to enjoin\n\nbecause the court had found no violation of the statute and so the\n\nissue of whether enforcement of the statute would violate the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause was not before the court.                REBA also said\n\nthere was nothing left for the court to \"enjoin\" given the court's\n\nruling.     REBA also argued it should not be enjoined for its\n\nadvocacy in filing a lawsuit, nor should it be made to pay\n\nattorney's fees.         The court rejected those arguments (and did so\n\nwithout explanation).           REBA II, 642 F. Supp. at 64.\n\n            1.       The District Court Erred as a Matter of Law in\n                     Affording Relief to NREIS\n\n                     a.        No § 1983 Claim Was Stated because REBA Is\n                               Not a State Actor\n\n            Unless REBA was a \"state actor\" there can be no § 1983\n\nclaim against REBA.        Tomaiolo v. Mallinoff, 281 F.3d l, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); Yeo v. Town of Lexington, 131 F.3d 241, 248-49 & n.3 (1st\n\nCir.    1997).     The     §    1983   counterclaim    posited   that   REBA,    an\n\notherwise private association, became a state actor by virtue of\n\nthe role given it by § 46B.              The district court agreed, holding\n\nthat REBA, by bringing suit under § 46B and making the allegations\n\nit did, became a state actor because REBA had assumed a traditional\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fpublic function.    REBA I, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 144 n.67.          No other\n\ntheory of state action was argued or considered.\n\n            The public function theory requires a plaintiff to \"show\n\nmore than the mere performance of a public function by a private\n\nentity.\"    Perkins v. Londonderry Basketball Club, 196 F.3d 13, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     A plaintiff must show that \"the private party\n\nperformed a public function that has been 'traditionally the\n\nexclusive prerogative of the state,'\" Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp.\n\nSan Juan Capestrano, 412 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Blum v.\n\nYaretsky,   457   U.S.   991,   1005   (1982)).   This   is   a   demanding\n\nstandard, and the plaintiff has the burden to meet it.                 See\n\nPerkins, 196 F.3d at 19.\n\n            Here it is clear that NREIS failed to meet its burden.\n\nAnd the district court's ruling, which involved no analysis of\n\nwhether REBA's filing of a lawsuit and advocacy of a position in\n\ncourt was traditionally and exclusively reserved to the state, was\n\nin error.\n\n            Section 46B does not delegate to private actors functions\n\nthat are traditionally \"exclusively reserved to the State.\"            Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).         It does nothing more than grant bar\n\nassociations, along with three or more members of the Massachusetts\n\nbar, the attorney general, and district attorneys, standing to\n\nbring suit enforcing the unauthorized-practice-of-law statute.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B.        An action undertaken by a private\n\n\n                                  - 22 -\n\fparty does not become state action merely because the action is\n\nauthorized by state statute. Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S.\n\n149, 164-66 (1978) (holding that the defendant warehouseman's sale\n\nof goods pursuant to a statute authorizing self-help was not state\n\naction);    Estades-Negroni, 412 F.3d at 6.\n\n            The Commonwealth, as a matter of policy, chose to give\n\nbar associations a defined role in bringing court actions to seek\n\na judicial determination whether the challenged actions constitute\n\nthe unauthorized practice of law.             But that role was a limited one.\n\nSection 46B grants the bar association itself no power to make a\n\ndetermination      as   to       whether    the    challenged    activity   is   the\n\nunauthorized practice of law.                REBA could not itself determine\n\nwhether its interpretation was correct, nor could it enforce its\n\ninterpretation.         Thus, while defining what is the unauthorized\n\npractice of law is the exclusive function of state government, cf.\n\nGoldfarb, 421 U.S. at 792, that is not what is at issue here.                    See\n\nLawline v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 956 F.2d 1378, 1384-85 (7th Cir. 1992)\n\n(holding that bar associations that formulated but could not decide\n\nunauthorized-practice-of-law rules were not state actors).\n\n            What is at issue--the bringing of a lawsuit to obtain a\n\ndeclaration as to legality--is far from an exclusive function of\n\ngovernment.       See Estades-Negroni, 412 F.3d at 8-9 (holding that\n\nparties    that    filed     a    court    petition    seeking    the   plaintiff's\n\ninvoluntary commitment did not thereby become state actors); cf.\n\n\n                                          - 23 -\n\fNowicki v. Ullsvik, 69 F.3d 1320, 1324 (7th Cir. 1995) (finding\n\nthat an attorney's successful motion to exclude a paralegal from\n\nparticipating in judicial proceedings on unauthorized-practice-of-\n\nlaw grounds was not state action).\n\n           Further, § 46B specifically includes private entities and\n\npeople as well as public officials.     It does not by its terms make\n\nthose private entities into public entities.         REBA is not an\n\nintegrated bar, nor is it a Massachusetts state agency.      \"That a\n\nprivate entity performs a function which serves the public does not\n\nmake its acts state action.\"   Rendell Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830,\n\n842 (1982).   Nor is there another statute giving REBA enforcement\n\npowers.6   Statutes restricting standing do not thereby transform\n\nthose granted standing into government actors.\n\n           REBA also could not be found a state actor under either\n\nthe state-compulsion or joint-action tests.     See Estades-Negroni,\n\n412 F.3d at 4-5.    Neither has been alleged.      As to the state-\n\ncompulsion test, there is no claim that the state \"has exercised\n\ncoercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,\n\n\n\n     6\n          The parties apparently failed to call to the court's\nattention our decision in Werle v. Rhode Island Bar Association,\n755 F.2d 195 (1st Cir. 1985).      There, a Committee of the Bar\nAssociation sent a letter requesting that plaintiff cease and\ndesist from the practice of law. Id. at 197. The district court\nheld that this was insufficient to make the association a state\nactor. Id. This court held that even if the bar association were\na state actor, the association would enjoy either absolute immunity\nlike prosecutors or qualified immunity like government officials.\nId. at 198.\n\n                               - 24 -\n\feither overt or covert, that the [challenged conduct] must in law\n\nbe deemed to be that of the State.\"                 Id. at 5 (quoting Blum, 457\n\nU.S. at 1004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in\n\noriginal).\n\n               For similar reasons, REBA also could not be found a\n\nstate actor under the joint-action test.                   There is no claim that\n\nthe   state    has    \"so    far      insinuated   itself    into   a   position   of\n\ninterdependence with [REBA] that it must be recognized as a joint\n\nparticipant in the challenged activity.\"                   Perkins, 196 F.3d at 21\n\n(quoting Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 725\n\n(1961)).           REBA     is    a    private     organization     that      operates\n\nindependently of the state government and is not a state actor.\n\n              b.          No Dormant Commerce Clause Claim Was Stated\n\n              In addition, because REBA is not a state actor, but a\n\nprivate    actor,     REBA       itself   cannot    have    violated    the   dormant\n\nCommerce Clause.            The dormant Commerce Clause is addressed to\n\nactions by states.               Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl.\n\nQuality, 511 U.S. 93, 98 (1994) (\"[T]he [Commerce] Clause has long\n\nbeen understood to have a 'negative' aspect that denies the States\n\nthe power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the\n\ninterstate flow of articles of commerce.\"); Family Winemakers of\n\nCal., 592 F.3d at 4 n.1.                For this reason as well, the dormant\n\nCommerce Clause claim based on REBA's filing of the lawsuit should\n\nhave been dismissed.\n\n\n                                          - 25 -\n\f                     c.      Our Precedent in National Revenue Corp. v.\n                             Violet Does Not Establish a Dormant Commerce\n                             Clause Violation in This Case\n\n            Finally, the district court incorrectly reasoned that its\n\nresult was consistent with a 1986 decision of this court in\n\nNational Revenue Corp. v. Violet, 807 F.2d 285 (1st Cir. 1986).            In\n\nViolet there was a judicial determination that an unauthorized-\n\npractice-of-law      statute     applied   to    certain    debt    collection\n\npractices.       Id. at 288.     The issue was whether the statute, as\n\ninterpreted and applied to the plaintiff, violated the Commerce\n\nClause, as the plaintiff had asserted in defense.             Id.   A divided\n\npanel of this court held that such an application constituted a\n\nCommerce Clause violation.          Id. at 290.      This was an utterly\n\nconventional application of a Commerce Clause defense.\n\n            In this case there was no judicial determination that the\n\nstatute applied to NREIS, only a nonfrivolous argument by REBA that\n\nit did, and REBA cannot be found to have acted unconstitutionally\n\nby making that argument.\n\n            2.       The Injunction Violated REBA's First Amendment\n                     Right to Petition\n\n            There is an even more fundamental problem with the award\n\nof injunctive and declaratory relief based on REBA's having filed\n\nsuit   in   state   court.      These   awards   undercut   First   Amendment\n\nprotections given to the bringing of nonfrivolous lawsuits and\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 26 -\n\fallegations made in court pleadings.7         Indeed, by its literal terms\n\nthe injunction could be thought to enjoin REBA from taking this\n\nappeal.\n\n            The right to petition the courts for redress implicates\n\nthe First Amendment right of free speech and right to petition the\n\ngovernment.      See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Ill. State Bar\n\nAss'n, 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967);          NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415,\n\n429 (1965); Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThese     principles   have   long     standing   in   our   constitutional\n\njurisprudence, and they include the right to file lawsuits that are\n\nnot baseless.8    BE & K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 524-26,\n\n\n     7\n          We do not consider whether, if REBA were a state actor,\nits filing of the lawsuit would be protected under the government\nspeech doctrine. See Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 129 S. Ct.\n1125, 1131-32 (2009); Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d 314,\n329-30 (1st Cir. 2009).\n     8\n          Even public employees, who are subject to far more\nrestrictions on their speech than private entities such as REBA,\nenjoy some protection against retaliation for speech on matters of\npublic concern; albeit there are countervailing public interests.\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 417-20 (2006); Connick v.\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391\nU.S. 563, 568 (1968); Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st\nCir. 2007). As we said in Dixon v. International Brotherhood of\nPolice Officers, 504 F.3d 73 (1st Cir. 2007),\n\n     The First Amendment protects an individual's right to\n     petition the courts, but that right is not absolute. For\n     example, in the labor and antitrust contexts, \"sham\"\n     suits can lead to civil liability if those suits \"were\n     both objectively baseless and subjectively motivated by\n     an unlawful purpose.\"\n\nId. at 86 (quoting BE & K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 531\n(2002)) (internal citation omitted).\n\n                                     - 27 -\n\f530-31 (2002); Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.

As our\n\ncertification of the question to the SJC demonstrates, REBA's\n\nbringing of the declaratory judgment action and its advocacy\n\nposition were far from frivolous.\n\n            Nor   is    the   claim    against     REBA    based   on   a   claimed\n\nviolation of a federal statute, such as the Sherman Act;9 it is\n\nbased on the Constitution.            This case does not involve statutory\n\nregulation of the activity of various market players, say, for\n\nexample, of lawyers functioning as debt collectors.                     Heintz v.\n\nJenkins, 514 U.S. 291, 293-94, 299 (1995) (holding that lawyers who\n\nregularly    collect     consumer      debt      through    litigation      may   be\n\nconsidered   \"debt      collectors\"      under    the     Fair   Debt   Collection\n\nPractices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692o, and are therefore subject\n\nto   liability    for   litigation      activities);       see   also   Jerman    v.\n\nCarlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 130 S. Ct. 1605,\n\n1609-11 (2010).\n\n            It is irrelevant to REBA's First Amendment protection\n\nthat the district court ruled against REBA on the merits of REBA's\n\nclaim that NREIS's activities were the unauthorized practice of\n\n\n      9\n          By parallel, in light of First Amendment concerns, the\nSupreme Court has construed the Sherman Act to prohibit only\nlawsuits that are both objectively baseless and subjectively\nintended to abuse process. Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.\nColumbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60-61 (1993).\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\flaw.   This First Amendment protection exists whether or not REBA's\n\nnonfrivolous claims are ultimately found to be meritorious.      BE &\n\nK Constr. Co., 536 U.S. at 532.    As the Supreme Court has pointed\n\nout, even if reasonably based suits are ultimately unsuccessful,\n\nsuch suits nonetheless advance some First Amendment interests,\n\nincluding raising matters of public concern and allowing the\n\nadvancement and development of legal theories.     Id. at 532.    The\n\nfiling of such suits adds legitimacy to the court system as the\n\ndesignated forum to resolve disputes.    Id.\n\n           The district court's issuance of the injunction and\n\ndeclaratory relief transgressed those First Amendment principles.\n\n           3.      NREIS's Claim REBA Waived the Arguments that It Is\n                   Not a State Actor and that It Is Entitled to First\n                   Amendment Protections Fails\n\n           NREIS argues REBA has waived any argument as to its\n\nstatus as a state actor or its entitlement to First Amendment\n\nprotection and that this court cannot, as a result, reach either\n\nissue.   It is true that REBA did not argue to the district court\n\nthat it was not a state actor or that its actions in bringing suit\n\nand in advocating as it did were protected by the First Amendment.\n\nWe have no need to address whether NREIS had some obligation to\n\nwarn the court of the First Amendment hazards of its theory.     Had\n\neither side done so, the district court might, forewarned, have\n\nstayed its hand.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 29 -\n\f          NREIS's pleadings were unclear, and it appears to have\n\nrefocused its Commerce Clause theory from a conventional defense\n\nthat enforcement of an applicable statute against it would violate\n\nthe dormant Commerce Clause to a claim that the mere bringing of\n\nsuit under §§ 46 and 46A alleging a violation was itself prohibited\n\nby the Commerce Clause. Because of the confusion caused by NREIS's\n\npleadings and briefing, REBA's arguments did not address the theory\n\non which the district court ultimately granted relief against it.\n\nFor this reason alone, we decline to find waiver on the First\n\nAmendment argument.\n\n          Even if there were waiver, we would excuse it.   It is a\n\nmatter of discretion in this court whether to reach the issues.\n\nMontalvo v. Gonzalez-Amparo, 587 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2009); Nat'l\n\nAss'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); see also Aroostook Band of Micmacs v. Ryan, 484 F.3d 41, 51\n\nn.11 (1st Cir. 2007) (exercising the court's discretion to reach an\n\nargument raised only in an amicus brief).   In deciding whether to\n\nreach issues we have considered: whether the litigant's failure to\n\nraise the issue has deprived the court of appeals of useful\n\nfactfinding, or whether the issue was of a purely legal nature;\n\nwhether the argument was highly persuasive and failure to reach it\n\nwould threaten a miscarriage of justice; whether considering the\n\nissue would cause prejudice or inequity to the adverse party;\n\nwhether the failure to raise the issue was inadvertent and provided\n\n\n                              - 30 -\n\fno advantage; whether the issue was of constitutional magnitude;\n\nand whether the issue implicates a matter of great public concern.\n\nMontalvo, 587 F.3d at 48-49; Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627-28.\n\n            Both the state action and First Amendment issues satisfy\n\nour criteria.      REBA gained no advantage in failing to raise these\n\nissues.    REBA's failure to argue it was not a state actor before\n\nthe district court and its effort to raise the issue on appeal did\n\nnot deprive this court of any useful factfinding, nor does it\n\nprejudice NREIS.     Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627-28.\n\n            As to the First Amendment issue, it is clearly one of\n\n\"constitutional magnitude.\"      Id. at 628.    It is also an issue of\n\ngreat     public    concern,   id.,   having    significance   to   the\n\nadministration of justice in the federal courts. No party bringing\n\nsuit should fear that its nonfrivolous advocacy of a reasonable\n\nposition in federal court will, on that basis alone, lead to an\n\ninjunction and declaration against it based on the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.    Much less should a party be made, based on its conduct in\n\nbringing such a suit, to fear the imposition of attorney's fees.\n\nFurther, this is a pure issue of law; no party is harmed by the\n\nabsence of fact finding.       Id. at 627-28.   The law is quite clear\n\nand this court has received the benefit of briefing on the issue\n\nfrom NREIS and the amicus Boston Bar Association.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 31 -\n\f                                   IV.\n\n          This brings us to the appropriate relief.       We vacate the\n\njudgment of the district court entering judgment against REBA,\n\nreverse all relief awarded on the counterclaim and vacate the award\n\nof attorney's fees and costs.\n\n          We certify the questions specified below to the SJC:\n\n          1. Whether NREIS's activities, either in whole or in\n\npart, based on the record in this case and as described in the\n\nparties' filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 et seq.\n\n          2.   Whether   NREIS's   activities,   in   contracting   with\n\nMassachusetts attorneys to attend closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 221, §§ 46 et seq.\n\n          We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other\n\nrelevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in\n\nthe proper resolution of the issues.\n\n          The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the\n\nMassachusetts SJC, under the official seal of this court, a copy of\n\nthe certified questions and our decision in this case, along with\n\na copy of the briefs and appendix filed by the parties in the\n\nfederal proceeding and the district court record, which set forth\n\nall facts relevant to the issues certified. We retain jurisdiction\n\nover REBA's claims pending the SJC's determination. The case shall\n\nbe stayed until receipt of the response of the SJC.\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fCosts of this appeal are awarded to REBA.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                   - 33 -\n\f",

Sparkes, III, and K &amp; L Gates LLP were on brief for the appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>In November 2006 the Real Estate Bar Association for Massachusetts, Inc. (\"REBA\") brought suit in state court against National Real Estate Information Services, Inc., later also naming National Real Estate Information Services (collectively \"NREIS\"), as REBA was given standing to do as a bar association under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B. REBA sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that certain activities NREIS engaged in constituted the unauthorized practice of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A. Those activities stemmed from NREIS's provision of real estate settlement services and its business as a title insurance agent.</p>\n<p>NREIS removed the case to federal district court on diversity grounds. The district court proved inhospitable to REBA's claims. Although the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") had never opined on these modern conveyancing practices by nonlawyers and had last addressed the general topic of conveyancing in 1935, the district court construed the sparse state case law and declared the practices at issue did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. The district court entered judgment against REBA on its suit. <i>See Real Estate Bar Ass'n for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs.</i> (<i>REBA I</i>), 609 F.Supp.2d 135, 143-44 (D.Mass.2009).</p>\n<p>The district court went further and issued injunctive and declaratory relief against the bar association, finding for NREIS on its purported counterclaim, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that REBA's very bringing of the lawsuit in state court had violated the dormant Commerce Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 147. The court then ordered REBA to pay attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $904,076.17 to NREIS as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. <i>Real Estate Bar Ass'n for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs.</i> (<i>REBA II</i>), 642 F.Supp.2d 58, 73 (D.Mass.2009).</p>\n<p>REBA appeals from the district court's summary judgment rulings and is supported by amicus briefs from two major bar associations in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Bar Association argues the district court was wrong in finding there was no violation of the unauthorized-practice-of-law statute. The Boston Bar Association argues that the issuance of the injunction and declaratory relief against REBA for having brought suit violated the First Amendment. REBA also requests this court to certify to the SJC the unauthorized-practice-of-law question that is the subject of its suit and to reverse all relief against it on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p>We vacate the district court's judgment against REBA on its unauthorized-practice-of-law claim. In Massachusetts, the state judicial branch, and the SJC in particular, is solely responsible for defining what is the practice of law. <i>See </i><i>Superadio Ltd. P'ship v. Winstar Radio Prods., LLC,</i> 446 Mass. 330, 844 N.E.2d 246, 250 (2006) (\"[T]he judicial department is necessarily the sole arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law ....\") (quoting <i>Lowell Bar Ass'n v. Loeb,</i> 315 Mass. 176, 52 N.E.2d 27, 31 (1943)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>In re Opinion of the Justices,</i> 289 Mass. 607, 194 N.E. 313, 316 (1935). Because there is no controlling precedent from the SJC which addresses whether NREIS's various activities constitute the unauthorized practice of law and because the answer to that question is unclear and may be determinative of this litigation, we certify that question to the SJC. <i>See</i> Mass. S.J.C. Rule 1:03; <i>Ropes &amp; Gray LLP v. Jalbert</i> (<i>In re Engage, Inc.</i>), 544 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We also reverse the district court's decision on NREIS's dormant Commerce Clause counterclaim. Without reaching the question of whether a defendant may assert as a counterclaim that the plaintiff is relying on an unconstitutional statute, we hold that issuance of relief here was improper. REBA is not a state actor, NREIS has not stated a dormant Commerce Clause claim against REBA, and REBA's bringing of its suit against NREIS under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We present the essential facts giving rise to this controversy which, unless otherwise indicated, are uncontested.</p>\n<p>The underlying legal dispute in this case is whether the activities required to transfer title in real estate and to issue insurance policies on the transfer of title in whole or in part constitute the practice of law. While the parties disagree as to what specific activities are required to transfer title, they generally agree that these transactions involve an inspection of the seller's legal title to the real estate before the transfer and, if necessary, resolution of any flaws in the seller's title to the property; execution of legal documents and the exchange of those documents and promised consideration at a \"closing;\" and recording of the legal documents at the registry of deeds.</p>\n<p>Title insurance policies can be issued at the time of closing by title insurance agents, who are independent of the title <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> insurance company, either to insure the owner or purchaser's interest in the real estate or to insure the interest of the mortgage lender. These policies incorporate an inspection of the title at the time of the closing, and any unresolved defects, liens, or encumbrances on the property may be identified as exceptions to the policy.</p>\n<p>REBA, formerly known as the Massachusetts Conveyancers' Association, Inc., is a 150-year-old bar association with a membership of approximately 3,000 Massachusetts real estate attorneys. REBA's website describes its members as representing \"lenders, buyers, sellers, owners, landlords and tenants in every real estate practice area and specialty including resolving title issues and title insurance, commercial leasing, transactional matters for both residential and commercial property, affordable housing, environmental, zoning, permitting and land use, alternative dispute resolution and litigation.\" Real Estate Bar Association of Massachusetts, About REBA, http://www.reba.net/ page/about (last visited June 3, 2010). It is not an integrated bar,<sup>[1]</sup> nor has the SJC delegated to it the resolution of questions about what is the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p>NREIS is a Pennsylvania-based corporation that provides real estate closing (which NREIS also calls \"vendor management\") and title insurance-related services for mortgage lenders throughout the country. It is a member of the Title/Appraisal Vendor Management Association (\"TAVMA\"), a national trade association of companies providing real estate closing services. NREIS's customers are mostly national mortgage loan companies. NREIS provides these companies with centralized back-office operations in support of their lending transactions. Aside from third-party lawyers with whom NREIS contracts to attend closings, NREIS does not employ any lawyers to provide its services. NREIS asserts that it does not hold itself out to its customers as practicing law or having the ability or qualifications to practice law.</p>\n<p>REBA has a history of attempting to curtail what it calls \"witness\" or \"notary\" real estate closings, in which all of the documents required to complete a real estate transaction are compiled by nonlawyer third parties and an attorney only witnesses the closing of the transaction.</p>\n<p>REBA believes that the essential tasks involved in a real estate transaction are an \"interconnected series of activities that must be performed in order to convey the various legal interests in ... real estate,\" and each of the activities must be overseen, if not personally conducted, by an attorney. REBA's position is that some mechanical tasks, such as creating title abstracts, may be delegated to nonattorneys, so long as \"the lawyer maintains a direct relationship with the client, supervises the delegated work, and has responsibility for the work product.\" REBA also alleges that the issuing of title insurance policies is the practice of law because title insurance policies are issued based on the examination and legal analysis of the seller's legal title in the property, which REBA asserts must be conducted by an attorney.</p>\n<p>Consistent with its views, REBA has opposed bills in the legislature that would formally recognize witness closings in Massachusetts and has tried to persuade affiliated bar associations to petition the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> SJC to adopt, through rulemaking, REBA's own definition of the practice of law into the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. REBA also filed and won two lawsuits in 1993 and 2001 in Massachusetts Superior Court to enjoin local companies, not run by lawyers, from providing real estate settlement services. <i>See Mass. Conveyancers Assoc., Inc. v. Colonial Title &amp; Escrow, Inc.,</i> No. Civ. 96-2746-C, 2001 WL 669280 (Mass.Super.2001) (finding the defendant corporation engaged in unauthorized practice of law and enjoining the defendant from, inter alia, evaluating title and closing agreements, drafting legal documents, explaining legal documents at closing, and issuing title insurance policies based on the defendant's title evaluations); <i>Mass. Assoc. of Bank Counsel, Inc. v. Closings, Ltd.,</i> No. 903053C, 1993 WL 818916, at *2 (Mass.Super.1993) (granting default judgment, finding defendant engaged in unauthorized practice of law and enjoining defendant from drafting instruments related to real estate and giving advice in connection with real estate closings, as well as \"handling all aspects of residential real estate closings\"). Neither decision was appealed to the SJC. This suit, REBA hoped, would ultimately result in an authoritative judgment by the SJC on these continuing issues.</p>\n<p>NREIS both provides real estate closing services and acts as a title insurance agent in Massachusetts. In helping to coordinate a real estate closing, NREIS, at the lender's request, may provide any of the following services in Massachusetts: (1) obtaining valuations of a property and third-party reports such as tax certifications and flood reports; (2) obtaining title searches from a third-party vendor; (3) drafting the settlement statement; (4) scheduling the closing with a Massachusetts attorney who will attend and transmitting the lender's documents to that attorney for the closing; (5) disbursing settlement funds, held by NREIS in its own bank account until the mortgage has been executed by a borrower; and (6) ensuring that the transaction documents were completed properly and properly recorded. NREIS describes these activities as administrative and not legal.</p>\n<p>The title search is conducted by a third-party vendor under contract to NREIS. One of those companies, Connelly Title, itself does not employ any lawyers and purports only to provide title abstracting services and no legal analysis. NREIS does not conduct its own review of the title abstract provided by Connelly Title.</p>\n<p>When a lender-customer requests that NREIS provide a deed for a transaction, NREIS contracts with another third-party vendor, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based company. That company is not a law firm.</p>\n<p>As to the closings themselves, NREIS schedules the closing to be attended by a Massachusetts attorney, selected from a list it maintains of around seventy-four lawyers. Before the closing, NREIS sends the relevant documents to the attorney. NREIS does not provide any instructions as to how the attorney should conduct the closing.</p>\n<p>NREIS also acts as a title insurance agent on its transactions when requested. When acting as an agent, NREIS does not review the status of the real estate title. It prepares the title insurance policy based on a title abstract provided by a third-party vendor, simply copying the contents of the abstract into the policy documents. NREIS issues polices for several companies that write title insurance in Massachusetts, including Stewart Title, First American, Ticor Title, and Old Republic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>REBA filed its original complaint on November 6, 2006, and its amended complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> on February 2, 2007, in Suffolk County Superior Court, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A, and 46B, seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction against NREIS's activities in Massachusetts. The statute, at § 46, states that aside from corporations established to practice law, \"[n]o corporation or association shall practice or appear as an attorney for any person other than itself\" and explicitly prohibits corporations from drafting legal documents or giving legal advice not relating to their own businesses, or holding themselves out to the public as being able to practice law. <i>Id.</i> § 46. Section 46A provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o individual, other than a member, in good standing, of the bar of this commonwealth shall practice law, or, by word, sign, letter, advertisement or otherwise, hold himself out as authorized, entitled, competent, qualified or able to practice law.\" <i>Id.</i> § 46A.</p>\n<p>Section 46B provides concurrent jurisdiction to the SJC and Massachusetts superior courts to restrain violations of §§ 46, 46A, and 46C \"upon petition of any bar association within the commonwealth, or of three or more members of the bar of the commonwealth, or of the attorney general, or of the district attorney within his district.\" <i>Id.</i> § 46B.</p>\n<p>REBA's amended complaint asserted there was a controversy as to \"whether Massachusetts law permits a non-lawyer who is not a party to a real estate transaction to control and supervise the conveyance of a legal interest in ... real property... where the only participation of an attorney is restricted to notarizing documents at the settlement of the transaction.\" It sought declaratory judgment that NREIS was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The complaint further stated there was disagreement as to whether NREIS could legally contract with Massachusetts attorneys to provide legal services to third parties.</p>\n<p>REBA sought declaratory judgment that \"an attorney retained to perform a conveyance of a legal interest in Massachusetts real property on behalf of a bank or lender must have a direct attorney-client relationship with the bank or mortgage lender client, and that [NREIS is] not permitted to interpose [itself] into that attorney-client relationship or otherwise control it.\" REBA also sought relief in the form of a preliminary and permanent injunction against NREIS \"engaging in any of the activities which constitute a conveyance of real property unless they are acting under the supervision or control of a Massachusetts attorney.\" REBA did not seek monetary damages.</p>\n<p>On February 6, 2007, NREIS removed the action, under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, to the federal district court in Massachusetts on diversity grounds. REBA agreed to dismiss from the original case the one nondiverse defendant, a Massachusetts attorney.</p>\n<p>At the same time, NREIS filed in the federal district court an answer to REBA's complaint denying REBA's allegations and asserting what it styled as a counterclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The counterclaim sought (1) declaratory judgment that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46A, \"if interpreted against NREIS as plaintiff contends, violates the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution,\" (2) an injunction against REBA \"preventing NREIS from engaging in interestate commerce free from restrictive state action,\" and (3) attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Certification of REBA's Claim to the SJC</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first vacate the district court's entry of judgment against REBA on its unauthorized-practice-of-law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> claim. The district court interpreted state law and held that NREIS's activities do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A. We certify questions regarding REBA's claim to the SJC.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts certification rule provides for certification \"if there are involved in any proceeding before [the federal court] questions of law of this State which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decision of this court.\" Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 § 1; <i>see also </i><i>Hundley v. Marsh</i> (<i>In re Hundley</i>), 603 F.3d 95, 98 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"When Massachusetts law is at issue, the SJC has provided that we may certify questions to it in cases where we `find[] no controlling precedent, and where the questions may be determinative of the pending cause of action.'\") (quoting <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 52) (alternation in original).</p>\n<p>The conditions for certification are met. Should the SJC decide that the activities NREIS has engaged in do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, that \"may be determinative\" of this case.</p>\n<p>There is no controlling precedent from the SJC. A 1935 opinion of the SJC, <i>In re Opinion of the Justices,</i> notes that the practice of law \"embraces conveyancing.\" 194 N.E. at 317. But there is no controlling precedent that establishes a definition for \"conveyancing\" or the extent of activities that constitute conveyancing. The district court correctly noted that there was no SJC precedent \"directly on point\" on what activities constituted conveyancing and that \"the SJC has not explicitly addressed whether the practice of law embraces all the interconnected activities of a real estate conveyance.\" <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 142-43. The district court was also correct to note that state law provided little \"guidance as to the level of involvement an attorney must have\" in the conveyancing activities. <i>Id.</i> at 143.</p>\n<p>Of course, \"even in the absence of controlling precedent, certification would be inappropriate where state law is sufficiently clear to allow us to predict its course.\" <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 53. This is not such a case. The district court's conclusion that the statute has not been violated is at least in tension with the view of the two state trial court determinations in Massachusetts, and perhaps one determination by a single SJC justice. REBA cites a decision by a single justice in a disciplinary case, <i>In re Eric Levine,</i> No. BD-2002-075, 2004 WL 5214985 (Mass. St. Bar Disp. Bd.2004), which found a suspended attorney had engaged in the practice of law when the attorney continued to provide closing services following his suspension, even though a licensed attorney attended the actual closings. <i>Id.</i> at *2. These opinions, as the district court recognized, are not opinions of the full SJC and so are not dispositive. <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 142.</p>\n<p>NREIS, in turn, relies on several SJC opinions holding that certain other economic activities, such as filling in tax forms, preparing a reaffirmation form in a bankruptcy proceeding, and conducting research on real estate titles in the registry of deeds and then reporting and making recommendations to a lawyer based on the research, did not constitute the practice of law. <i>See </i><i>In re Chimko,</i> 444 Mass. 743, 831 N.E.2d 316, 321-22 (2005); <i>Goldblatt v. Corp. Counsel of Boston,</i> 360 Mass. 660, 277 N.E.2d 273, 277 &amp; n. 4 (1971); <i>Lowell Bar Ass'n,</i> 52 N.E.2d at 34. None of those authorities is analogous to this case, and NREIS itself acknowledges that they do not directly address REBA's claim.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> Unlike other certification cases in which there is mere risk of error by the federal courts in ruling on state law issues, <i>see </i><i>Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co.,</i> 529 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.2008), here there are even stronger reasons to commit these questions to the SJC in the first instance. Apart from the lack of certainty in state law, it is especially appropriate to certify this question to the SJC because whether NREIS's various activities here constitute the unauthorized practice of law raises serious policy concerns regarding the practice of law that will certainly impact future cases. Such policy judgments are best left to the SJC, which is responsible for defining the practice of law in Massachusetts. <i>See </i><i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 57; <i>Boston Gas Co.,</i> 529 F.3d at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the interests of federalism are best served by certification. We have been particularly mindful of those concerns and have certified before when the issues concern the SJC's control over the practice of law. <i>E.g., </i><i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 57-58 (certifying, inter alia, the question of whether a state attorney lien statute applies to \"patents and patent applications\"). Federal law recognizes that states have \"an especially great\" interest in regulating the practice of law. <i>Goldfarb v. Va. State Bar,</i> 421 U.S. 773, 792, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975) (\"The interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice....\"). The authority to regulate the practice of law has been left to the states \"[s]ince the founding of the Republic.\" <i>Leis v. Flynt,</i> 439 U.S. 438, 442, 99 S.Ct. 698, 58 L.Ed.2d 717 (1979).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>There are also strong federalism interests that are furthered by providing the state courts with the opportunity to decide on underlying unsettled questions of state law. <i>Cf. </i><i>Growe v. Emison,</i> 507 U.S. 25, 32, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993) (noting circumstances in which \"principles of federalism and comity dictate\" deferring to state courts, such as \"when the federal action raises difficult questions of state law bearing on important matters of state policy\").</p>\n<p>We therefore certify to the Massachusetts SJC the following questions:</p>\n<p>1. Whether NREIS's activities, either in whole or in part, based on the record in this case and as described in the parties' filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> 2. Whether NREIS's activities, in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to attend closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other relevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in the proper resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Issuance of Injunctive and Declaratory Relief against REBA under § 1983 for Violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause Was Error</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court also granted summary judgment on NREIS's counterclaim and issued injunctive and declaratory relief against REBA.<sup>[3]</sup> Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Family Winemakers of Cal. v. Jenkins,</i> 592 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010). \"We review a district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion; we review its underlying conclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for clear error.\" <i>Shell Co. (P.R.), Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.,</i> 605 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>We bypass the question of whether a defendant may assert as a counterclaim that a statute if construed to apply would violate the dormant Commerce Clause.<sup>[4]</sup> Whatever the procedural vehicle, the theory of the counterclaim as to which injunctive relief was granted is not viable for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>We start with the ambiguity in NREIS's theory, which provided context for the odd configuration of arguments before the district court. The counterclaim stated what appeared to be a conventional defense: that if REBA's interpretation of the state statute were adopted by the court then the statute, as so interpreted (presumably by a court), would violate the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>The counterclaim, however, also alleged that \"[t]he Amended Complaint by plaintiff and its interpretation of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46A], is an act of economic protectionism by Massachusetts lawyers against out-of-state competition for settlement services.\" This could be read to allege an unusual theory, that the filing of the complaint alleging unauthorized practice was itself a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>REBA read the counterclaim to embody the first argument. It argued to the district court that the statute, if interpreted by a court to prohibit NREIS's activities, would not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, thus interpreting the theory as a conventional defense. Under that argument, if the court did not interpret the statute to apply to NREIS's activities, then the Commerce Clause claim would be hypothetical and not be reached. NREIS, however, argued it was entitled to an injunction and declaratory relief against REBA, mixing both readings of what its theory was. In a <i>reply</i> brief, NREIS said it sought an injunction based on REBA's advocacy of its theory in the litigation, the second reading.</p>\n<p>The district court took up the second theory and enjoined REBA \"from enforcing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> on NREIS its <i>interpretation</i> of the practice of law as encompassing (1) all the interconnected activities of a real estate conveyance and (2) the issuance of title insurance.\" <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 147 (emphasis added). The court held that NREIS \"is entitled to a declaratory judgment that REBA's <i>interpretation</i> of the practice of law as encompassing all the interconnected steps of a real estate conveyance violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The court said its \"holding address[ed] the constitutionality of REBA's interpretation of what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law . . ., not the constitutionality of sections 46 and 46A themselves.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 147 n. 91.</p>\n<p>The district court thus held that REBA's actions in bringing a suit before a state court seeking an adjudication that certain activities violated a state statute were themselves a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. More specifically, the court held that REBA's <i>advocacy</i> of the particular position in state court that NREIS's activities violated the state law was a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>After the court issued the injunction, REBA argued at the hearing on attorney's fees that there had been nothing to enjoin because the court had found no violation of the statute and so the issue of whether enforcement of the statute would violate the dormant Commerce Clause was not before the court. REBA also said there was nothing left for the court to \"enjoin\" given the court's ruling. REBA also argued it should not be enjoined for its advocacy in filing a lawsuit, nor should it be made to pay attorney's fees. The court rejected those arguments (and did so without explanation). <i>REBA II,</i> 642 F.Supp.2d at 64.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The District Court Erred as a Matter of Law in Affording Relief to NREIS</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>No § 1983 Claim Was Stated because REBA Is Not a State Actor</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Unless REBA was a \"state actor\" there can be no § 1983 claim against REBA. <i>Tomaiolo v. Mallinoff,</i> 281 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Yeo v. Town of Lexington,</i> 131 F.3d 241, 248-49 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1997). The § 1983 counterclaim posited that REBA, an otherwise private association, became a state actor by virtue of the role given it by § 46B. The district court agreed, holding that REBA, by bringing suit under § 46B and making the allegations it did, became a state actor because REBA had assumed a traditional public function. <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 144 n. 67. No other theory of state action was argued or considered.</p>\n<p>The public function theory requires a plaintiff to \"show more than the mere performance of a public function by a private entity.\" <i>Perkins v. Londonderry Basketball Club,</i> 196 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1999). A plaintiff must show that \"the private party performed a public function that has been `traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state,'\" <i>Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp. San Juan Capestrano,</i> 412 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Blum</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> <i>v. Yaretsky,</i> 457 U.S. 991, 1005, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982)). This is a demanding standard, and the plaintiff has the burden to meet it. <i>See </i><i>Perkins,</i> 196 F.3d at 19.</p>\n<p>Here it is clear that NREIS failed to meet its burden. And the district court's ruling, which involved no analysis of whether REBA's filing of a lawsuit and advocacy of a position in court was traditionally and <i>exclusively</i> reserved to the state, was in error.</p>\n<p>Section 46B does not delegate to private actors functions that are traditionally \"<i>exclusively</i> reserved to the State.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). It does nothing more than grant bar associations, along with three or more members of the Massachusetts bar, the attorney general, and district attorneys, standing to bring suit enforcing the unauthorized-practice-of-law statute. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B. An action undertaken by a private party does not become state action merely because the action is authorized by state statute. <i>Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks,</i> 436 U.S. 149, 164-66, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978) (holding that the defendant warehouseman's sale of goods pursuant to a statute authorizing self-help was not state action); <i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 412 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth, as a matter of policy, chose to give bar associations a defined role in bringing court actions to seek a judicial determination whether the challenged actions constitute the unauthorized practice of law. But that role was a limited one. Section 46B grants the bar association itself no power to make a determination as to whether the challenged activity is the unauthorized practice of law. REBA could not itself determine whether its interpretation was correct, nor could it enforce its interpretation. Thus, while defining what is the unauthorized practice of law is the exclusive function of state government, <i>cf. </i><i>Goldfarb,</i> 421 U.S. at 792, 95 S.Ct. 2004, that is not what is at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Lawline v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 956 F.2d 1378, 1384-85 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that bar associations that formulated but could not decide unauthorized-practice-of-law rules were not state actors).</p>\n<p>What is at issuethe bringing of a lawsuit to obtain a declaration as to legalityis far from an exclusive function of government. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 412 F.3d at 8-9 (holding that parties that filed a court petition seeking the plaintiff's involuntary commitment did not thereby become state actors); <i>cf. </i><i>Nowicki v. Ullsvik,</i> 69 F.3d 1320, 1324 (7th Cir.1995) (finding that an attorney's successful motion to exclude a paralegal from participating in judicial proceedings on unauthorized-practice-of-law grounds was not state action).</p>\n<p>Further, § 46B specifically includes private entities and people as well as public officials. It does not by its terms make those private entities into public entities. REBA is not an integrated bar, nor is it a Massachusetts state agency. \"That a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its acts state action.\" <i>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn,</i> 457 U.S. 830, 842, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982). Nor is there another statute giving REBA enforcement powers.<sup>[6]</sup> Statutes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> restricting standing do not thereby transform those granted standing into government actors.</p>\n<p>REBA also could not be found a state actor under either the state-compulsion or joint-action tests. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 412 F.3d at 4-5. Neither has been alleged. As to the state-compulsion test, there is no claim that the state \"has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the [challenged conduct] must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5 (quoting <i>Blum,</i> 457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, REBA also could not be found a state actor under the joint-action test. There is no claim that the state has \"so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [REBA] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\" <i>Perkins,</i> 196 F.3d at 21 (quoting <i>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth.,</i> 365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)). REBA is a private organization that operates independently of the state government and is not a state actor.</p>\n<blockquote>b. <i>No Dormant Commerce Clause Claim Was Stated</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, because REBA is not a state actor, but a private actor, REBA itself cannot have violated the dormant Commerce Clause. The dormant Commerce Clause is addressed to actions by states. <i>Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality,</i> 511 U.S. 93, 98, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994) (\"[T]he [Commerce] Clause has long been understood to have a `negative' aspect that denies the States the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.\"); <i>Family Winemakers of Cal.,</i> 592 F.3d at 4 n. 1. For this reason as well, the dormant Commerce Clause claim based on REBA's filing of the lawsuit should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Our Precedent in </i><i>National Revenue Corp. v. Violet</i><i> Does Not Establish a Dormant Commerce Clause Violation in This Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, the district court incorrectly reasoned that its result was consistent with a 1986 decision of this court in <i>National Revenue Corp. v. Violet,</i> 807 F.2d 285 (1st Cir.1986). In <i>Violet</i> there was a judicial determination that an unauthorized-practice-of-law statute applied to certain debt collection practices. <i>Id.</i> at 288. The issue was whether the statute, as interpreted and applied to the plaintiff, violated the Commerce Clause, as the plaintiff had asserted in defense. <i>Id.</i> A divided panel of this court held that such an application constituted a Commerce Clause violation. <i>Id.</i> at 290. This was an utterly conventional application of a Commerce Clause defense.</p>\n<p>In this case there was no judicial determination that the statute applied to NREIS, only a nonfrivolous argument by REBA that it did, and REBA cannot be found to have acted unconstitutionally by making that argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Injunction Violated REBA's First Amendment Right to Petition</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is an even more fundamental problem with the award of injunctive and declaratory relief based on REBA's having filed suit in state court. These awards undercut First Amendment protections given to the bringing of nonfrivolous lawsuits and allegations made in court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> pleadings.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, by its literal terms the injunction could be thought to enjoin REBA from taking this appeal.</p>\n<p>The right to petition the courts for redress implicates the First Amendment right of free speech and right to petition the government. <i>See </i><i>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Ill. State Bar Ass'n,</i> 389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967); <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> 371 U.S. 415, 429, 83 S.Ct, 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004). These principles have long standing in our constitutional jurisprudence, and they include the right to file lawsuits that are not baseless.<sup>[8]</sup><i>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. v. NLRB,</i> 536 U.S. 516, 524-26, 530-31, 122 S.Ct. 2390, 153 L.Ed.2d 499 (2002); <i>Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.

NLRB,</i> 461 U.S. 731, 743-44, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983). As our certification of the question to the SJC demonstrates, REBA's bringing of the declaratory judgment action and its advocacy position were far from frivolous.</p>\n<p>Nor is the claim against REBA based on a claimed violation of a federal statute, such as the Sherman Act;<sup>[9]</sup> it is based on the Constitution. This case does not involve statutory regulation of the activity of various market players, say, for example, of lawyers functioning as debt collectors. <i>Heintz v. Jenkins,</i> 514 U.S. 291, 293-94, 299, 115 S.Ct. 1489, 131 L.Ed.2d 395 (1995) (holding that lawyers who regularly collect consumer debt through litigation may be considered \"debt collectors\" under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692o, and are therefore subject to liability for litigation activities); <i>see also </i><i>Jerman v.

This First Amendment protection exists whether or not REBA's nonfrivolous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> claims are ultimately found to be meritorious. <i>BE &amp; K Constr. Co.,</i> 536 U.S. at 532, 122 S.Ct. 2390. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, even if reasonably based suits are ultimately unsuccessful, such suits nonetheless advance some First Amendment interests, including raising matters of public concern and allowing the advancement and development of legal theories. <i>Id.</i> at 532, 122 S.Ct. 2390. The filing of such suits adds legitimacy to the court system as the designated forum to resolve disputes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court's issuance of the injunction and declaratory relief transgressed those First Amendment principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>NREIS's Claim REBA Waived the Arguments that It Is Not a State Actor and that It Is Entitled to First Amendment Protections Fails</i>\n</h2>\n<p>NREIS argues REBA has waived any argument as to its status as a state actor or its entitlement to First Amendment protection and that this court cannot, as a result, reach either issue. It is true that REBA did not argue to the district court that it was not a state actor or that its actions in bringing suit and in advocating as it did were protected by the First Amendment. We have no need to address whether NREIS had some obligation to warn the court of the First Amendment hazards of its theory. Had either side done so, the district court might, forewarned, have stayed its hand.</p>\n<p>NREIS's pleadings were unclear, and it appears to have refocused its Commerce Clause theory from a conventional defense that enforcement of an applicable statute against it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause to a claim that the mere bringing of suit under §§ 46 and 46A alleging a violation was itself prohibited by the Commerce Clause. Because of the confusion caused by NREIS's pleadings and briefing, REBA's arguments did not address the theory on which the district court ultimately granted relief against it. For this reason alone, we decline to find waiver on the First Amendment argument.</p>\n<p>Even if there were waiver, we would excuse it. It is a matter of discretion in this court whether to reach the issues. <i>Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Amparo,</i> 587 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Social Workers v. Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also </i><i>Aroostook Band of Micmacs v. Ryan,</i> 484 F.3d 41, 51 n. 11 (1st Cir.2007) (exercising the court's discretion to reach an argument raised only in an amicus brief). In deciding whether to reach issues we have considered: whether the litigant's failure to raise the issue has deprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding, or whether the issue was of a purely legal nature; whether the argument was highly persuasive and failure to reach it would threaten a miscarriage of justice; whether considering the issue would cause prejudice or inequity to the adverse party; whether the failure to raise the issue was inadvertent and provided no advantage; whether the issue was of constitutional magnitude; and whether the issue implicates a matter of great public concern. <i>Montalvo,</i> 587 F.3d at 48-49; <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627-28.</p>\n<p>Both the state action and First Amendment issues satisfy our criteria. REBA gained no advantage in failing to raise these issues. REBA's failure to argue it was not a state actor before the district court and its effort to raise the issue on appeal did not deprive this court of any useful factfinding, nor does it prejudice NREIS. <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627-28.</p>\n<p>As to the First Amendment issue, it is clearly one of \"constitutional magnitude.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628. It is also an issue of great <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> public concern, <i>id.,</i> having significance to the administration of justice in the federal courts. No party bringing suit should fear that its nonfrivolous advocacy of a reasonable position in federal court will, on that basis alone, lead to an injunction and declaration against it based on the dormant Commerce Clause. Much less should a party be made, based on its conduct in bringing such a suit, to fear the imposition of attorney's fees. Further, this is a pure issue of law; no party is harmed by the absence of fact finding. <i>Id.</i> at 627-28. The law is quite clear and this court has received the benefit of briefing on the issue from NREIS and the amicus Boston Bar Association.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>This brings us to the appropriate relief. We vacate the judgment of the district court entering judgment against REBA, reverse all relief awarded on the counterclaim and vacate the award of attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n<p>We certify the questions specified below to the SJC:</p>\n<p>1. Whether NREIS's activities, either in whole or in part, based on the record in this case and as described in the parties' filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>2. Whether NREIS's activities, in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to attend closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other relevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in the proper resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p>The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the Massachusetts SJC, under the official seal of this court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision in this case, along with a copy of the briefs and appendix filed by the parties in the federal proceeding and the district court record, which set forth all facts relevant to the issues certified. We retain jurisdiction over REBA's claims pending the SJC's determination. The case shall be stayed until receipt of the response of the SJC.</p>\n<p>Costs of this appeal are awarded to REBA.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"An `integrated' bar is an association of attorneys in which membership and dues are required as a condition of practicing law in the jurisdiction.\" <i>Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico,</i> 917 F.2d 620, 623 n. 1 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[2]  We note that REBA sought to obtain a ruling in state court and that its efforts were thwarted by the removal of the case to the federal court. REBA did not choose to have the state law question decided by a federal court. NREIS made that decision through removal. The existence of diversity sufficient to permit the exercise of federal jurisdiction is an insufficient reason to deprive the SJC of its normal role as arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law in Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>NREIS argues that REBA failed to move for certification to the SJC in the district court and for that reason we must have a compelling reason to certify. This factor is one of many to be considered in the exercise of our discretion. <i>See </i><i>Boston Car Co., Inc. v. Acura Auto. Div., Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d 811, 817 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992). This court has discretion to certify questions to the SJC when a party fails to move for certification in the district court, or to do so sua sponte. <i>Hundley,</i> 603 F.3d at 98; <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 57 n. 10; <i>Me. Drilling and Blasting, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 34 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994). The arguments for certification in this case are compelling.</p>\n<p>NREIS also argues that REBA raises a theory in its petition for certification that REBA did not present to the district court: that the individual steps in a real estate transaction, and not just the process as a whole, constitute the practice of law. We decline to reach this question.</p>\n<p>[3]  Based upon these findings, the court concluded that NREIS was a prevailing party in a § 1983 action and awarded attorney's fees and costs of $904,076.17 against REBA under § 1988. Because we vacate the findings of liability on all theories, NREIS cannot be a prevailing party, and it is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p>[4]  The parties have not briefed this question, and so we vacate the district court's holding on other grounds. We note, however, that the assertion that a statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause can be and usually is raised as an affirmative defense, as NREIS also did in this case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sadler v. NCR Corp.,</i> 928 F.2d 48, 53-56 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, the court could not have ruled on the constitutionality of these provisions of state law because that would, in light of its holding that these provisions were inapplicable, have been an advisory opinion, forbidden by Article III. <i>Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA,</i> 383 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A court cannot hear an action that loses `its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.'\") (quoting <i>Hall v. Beals,</i> 396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p>[6]  The parties apparently failed to call to the court's attention our decision in <i>Werle v. Rhode Island Bar Association,</i> 755 F.2d 195 (1st Cir.1985). There, a Committee of the Bar Association sent a letter requesting that plaintiff cease and desist from the practice of law. <i>Id.</i> at 197. The district court held that this was insufficient to make the association a state actor. <i>Id.</i> This court held that even if the bar association were a state actor, the association would enjoy either absolute immunity like prosecutors or qualified immunity like government officials. <i>Id.</i> at 198.</p>\n<p>[7]  We do not consider whether, if REBA were a state actor, its filing of the lawsuit would be protected under the government speech doctrine. <i>See Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___ ___, 129 S.Ct. 1125, 1131-32, 172 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009); <i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> 584 F.3d 314, 329-30 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[8]  Even public employees, who are subject to far more restrictions on their speech than private entities such as REBA, enjoy some protection against retaliation for speech on matters of public concern; albeit there are countervailing public interests. <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 417-20, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006); <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 142, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir.2007). As we said in <i>Dixon v. International Brotherhood of Police Officers,</i> 504 F.3d 73 (1st Cir.2007),\n</p>\n<p>The First Amendment protects an individual's right to petition the courts, but that right is not absolute. For example, in the labor and antitrust contexts, \"sham\" suits can lead to civil liability if those suits \"were both objectively baseless and subjectively motivated by an unlawful purpose.\"</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 86 (quoting <i>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. v. NLRB,</i> 536 U.S. 516, 531, 122 S.Ct. 2390, 1533 L.Ed.2d 499 (2002)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[9]  By parallel, in light of First Amendment concerns, the Supreme Court has construed the Sherman Act to prohibit only lawsuits that are both objectively baseless and subjectively intended to abuse process. <i>Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 49, 60-61, 113 S.Ct. 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 611 (1993).</p>\n\n</div>",

(\"REBA\") brought suit in state court against National Real Estate Information Services, Inc., later also naming National Real Estate Information Services (collectively \"NREIS\"), as REBA was given standing to do as a bar association under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B. REBA sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that certain activities NREIS engaged in constituted the unauthorized practice of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A. Those activities stemmed from NREIS's provision of real estate settlement services and its business as a title insurance agent.</p>\n<p>NREIS removed the case to federal district court on diversity grounds. The district court proved inhospitable to REBA's claims. Although the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") had never opined on these modern conveyancing practices by nonlawyers and had last addressed the general topic of conveyancing in 1935, the district court construed the sparse state case law and declared the practices at issue did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law. The district court entered judgment against REBA on its suit. <i>See Real Estate Bar Ass'n for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs.</i> (<i>REBA I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571849/real-estate-bar-assn-for-mass-inc-v-national-real-estate-information/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 143-44 (D.Mass.2009).</p>\n<p>The district court went further and issued injunctive and declaratory relief against the bar association, finding for NREIS on its purported counterclaim, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that REBA's very bringing of the lawsuit in state court had violated the dormant Commerce Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 147. The court then ordered REBA to pay attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $904,076.17 to NREIS as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. <i>Real Estate Bar Ass'n for Mass., Inc. v. Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs.</i> (<i>REBA II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416763/the-real-estate-bar-assn-for-mass-v-nreis/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 73 (D.Mass.2009).</p>\n<p>REBA appeals from the district court's summary judgment rulings and is supported by amicus briefs from two major bar associations in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Bar Association argues the district court was wrong in finding there was no violation of the unauthorized-practice-of-law statute. The Boston Bar Association argues that the issuance of the injunction and declaratory relief against REBA for having brought suit violated the First Amendment. REBA also requests this court to certify to the SJC the unauthorized-practice-of-law question that is the subject of its suit and to reverse all relief against it on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p>We vacate the district court's judgment against REBA on its unauthorized-practice-of-law claim. In Massachusetts, the state judicial branch, and the SJC in particular, is solely responsible for defining what is the practice of law. <i>See </i><i>Superadio Ltd. P'ship v. Winstar Radio Prods., LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span>, 250 (2006) (\"[T]he judicial department is necessarily the sole arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law ....\") (quoting <i>Lowell Bar Ass'n v.

Because there is no controlling precedent from the SJC which addresses whether NREIS's various activities constitute the unauthorized practice of law and because the answer to that question is unclear and may be determinative of this litigation, we certify that question to the SJC. <i>See</i> Mass. S.J.C. Rule 1:03; <i>Ropes &amp; Gray LLP v. Jalbert</i> (<i>In re Engage, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We also reverse the district court's decision on NREIS's dormant Commerce Clause counterclaim. Without reaching the question of whether a defendant may assert as a counterclaim that the plaintiff is relying on an unconstitutional statute, we hold that issuance of relief here was improper. REBA is not a state actor, NREIS has not stated a dormant Commerce Clause claim against REBA, and REBA's bringing of its suit against NREIS under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46B is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We present the essential facts giving rise to this controversy which, unless otherwise indicated, are uncontested.</p>\n<p>The underlying legal dispute in this case is whether the activities required to transfer title in real estate and to issue insurance policies on the transfer of title in whole or in part constitute the practice of law. While the parties disagree as to what specific activities are required to transfer title, they generally agree that these transactions involve an inspection of the seller's legal title to the real estate before the transfer and, if necessary, resolution of any flaws in the seller's title to the property; execution of legal documents and the exchange of those documents and promised consideration at a \"closing;\" and recording of the legal documents at the registry of deeds.</p>\n<p>Title insurance policies can be issued at the time of closing by title insurance agents, who are independent of the title <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> insurance company, either to insure the owner or purchaser's interest in the real estate or to insure the interest of the mortgage lender. These policies incorporate an inspection of the title at the time of the closing, and any unresolved defects, liens, or encumbrances on the property may be identified as exceptions to the policy.</p>\n<p>REBA, formerly known as the Massachusetts Conveyancers' Association, Inc., is a 150-year-old bar association with a membership of approximately 3,000 Massachusetts real estate attorneys. REBA's website describes its members as representing \"lenders, buyers, sellers, owners, landlords and tenants in every real estate practice area and specialty including resolving title issues and title insurance, commercial leasing, transactional matters for both residential and commercial property, affordable housing, environmental, zoning, permitting and land use, alternative dispute resolution and litigation.\" Real Estate Bar Association of Massachusetts, About REBA, http://www.reba.net/ page/about (last visited June 3, 2010). It is not an integrated bar,<sup>[1]</sup> nor has the SJC delegated to it the resolution of questions about what is the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p>NREIS is a Pennsylvania-based corporation that provides real estate closing (which NREIS also calls \"vendor management\") and title insurance-related services for mortgage lenders throughout the country. It is a member of the Title/Appraisal Vendor Management Association (\"TAVMA\"), a national trade association of companies providing real estate closing services. NREIS's customers are mostly national mortgage loan companies. NREIS provides these companies with centralized back-office operations in support of their lending transactions. Aside from third-party lawyers with whom NREIS contracts to attend closings, NREIS does not employ any lawyers to provide its services. NREIS asserts that it does not hold itself out to its customers as practicing law or having the ability or qualifications to practice law.</p>\n<p>REBA has a history of attempting to curtail what it calls \"witness\" or \"notary\" real estate closings, in which all of the documents required to complete a real estate transaction are compiled by nonlawyer third parties and an attorney only witnesses the closing of the transaction.</p>\n<p>REBA believes that the essential tasks involved in a real estate transaction are an \"interconnected series of activities that must be performed in order to convey the various legal interests in ... real estate,\" and each of the activities must be overseen, if not personally conducted, by an attorney. REBA's position is that some mechanical tasks, such as creating title abstracts, may be delegated to nonattorneys, so long as \"the lawyer maintains a direct relationship with the client, supervises the delegated work, and has responsibility for the work product.\" REBA also alleges that the issuing of title insurance policies is the practice of law because title insurance policies are issued based on the examination and legal analysis of the seller's legal title in the property, which REBA asserts must be conducted by an attorney.</p>\n<p>Consistent with its views, REBA has opposed bills in the legislature that would formally recognize witness closings in Massachusetts and has tried to persuade affiliated bar associations to petition the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> SJC to adopt, through rulemaking, REBA's own definition of the practice of law into the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. REBA also filed and won two lawsuits in 1993 and 2001 in Massachusetts Superior Court to enjoin local companies, not run by lawyers, from providing real estate settlement services. <i>See Mass. Conveyancers Assoc., Inc. v. Colonial Title &amp; Escrow, Inc.,</i> No. Civ. 96-2746-C, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">669280</span></span> (Mass.Super.2001) (finding the defendant corporation engaged in unauthorized practice of law and enjoining the defendant from, inter alia, evaluating title and closing agreements, drafting legal documents, explaining legal documents at closing, and issuing title insurance policies based on the defendant's title evaluations); <i>Mass. Assoc. of Bank Counsel, Inc. v. Closings, Ltd.,</i> No. 903053C, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">818916</span></span>, at *2 (Mass.Super.1993) (granting default judgment, finding defendant engaged in unauthorized practice of law and enjoining defendant from drafting instruments related to real estate and giving advice in connection with real estate closings, as well as \"handling all aspects of residential real estate closings\"). Neither decision was appealed to the SJC. This suit, REBA hoped, would ultimately result in an authoritative judgment by the SJC on these continuing issues.</p>\n<p>NREIS both provides real estate closing services and acts as a title insurance agent in Massachusetts. In helping to coordinate a real estate closing, NREIS, at the lender's request, may provide any of the following services in Massachusetts: (1) obtaining valuations of a property and third-party reports such as tax certifications and flood reports; (2) obtaining title searches from a third-party vendor; (3) drafting the settlement statement; (4) scheduling the closing with a Massachusetts attorney who will attend and transmitting the lender's documents to that attorney for the closing; (5) disbursing settlement funds, held by NREIS in its own bank account until the mortgage has been executed by a borrower; and (6) ensuring that the transaction documents were completed properly and properly recorded. NREIS describes these activities as administrative and not legal.</p>\n<p>The title search is conducted by a third-party vendor under contract to NREIS. One of those companies, Connelly Title, itself does not employ any lawyers and purports only to provide title abstracting services and no legal analysis. NREIS does not conduct its own review of the title abstract provided by Connelly Title.</p>\n<p>When a lender-customer requests that NREIS provide a deed for a transaction, NREIS contracts with another third-party vendor, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based company. That company is not a law firm.</p>\n<p>As to the closings themselves, NREIS schedules the closing to be attended by a Massachusetts attorney, selected from a list it maintains of around seventy-four lawyers. Before the closing, NREIS sends the relevant documents to the attorney. NREIS does not provide any instructions as to how the attorney should conduct the closing.</p>\n<p>NREIS also acts as a title insurance agent on its transactions when requested. When acting as an agent, NREIS does not review the status of the real estate title. It prepares the title insurance policy based on a title abstract provided by a third-party vendor, simply copying the contents of the abstract into the policy documents. NREIS issues polices for several companies that write title insurance in Massachusetts, including Stewart Title, First American, Ticor Title, and Old Republic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>REBA filed its original complaint on November 6, 2006, and its amended complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> on February 2, 2007, in Suffolk County Superior Court, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A, and 46B, seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction against NREIS's activities in Massachusetts. The statute, at § 46, states that aside from corporations established to practice law, \"[n]o corporation or association shall practice or appear as an attorney for any person other than itself\" and explicitly prohibits corporations from drafting legal documents or giving legal advice not relating to their own businesses, or holding themselves out to the public as being able to practice law. <i>Id.</i> § 46. Section 46A provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o individual, other than a member, in good standing, of the bar of this commonwealth shall practice law, or, by word, sign, letter, advertisement or otherwise, hold himself out as authorized, entitled, competent, qualified or able to practice law.\" <i>Id.</i> § 46A.</p>\n<p>Section 46B provides concurrent jurisdiction to the SJC and Massachusetts superior courts to restrain violations of §§ 46, 46A, and 46C \"upon petition of any bar association within the commonwealth, or of three or more members of the bar of the commonwealth, or of the attorney general, or of the district attorney within his district.\" <i>Id.</i> § 46B.</p>\n<p>REBA's amended complaint asserted there was a controversy as to \"whether Massachusetts law permits a non-lawyer who is not a party to a real estate transaction to control and supervise the conveyance of a legal interest in ... real property... where the only participation of an attorney is restricted to notarizing documents at the settlement of the transaction.\" It sought declaratory judgment that NREIS was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The complaint further stated there was disagreement as to whether NREIS could legally contract with Massachusetts attorneys to provide legal services to third parties.</p>\n<p>REBA sought declaratory judgment that \"an attorney retained to perform a conveyance of a legal interest in Massachusetts real property on behalf of a bank or lender must have a direct attorney-client relationship with the bank or mortgage lender client, and that [NREIS is] not permitted to interpose [itself] into that attorney-client relationship or otherwise control it.\" REBA also sought relief in the form of a preliminary and permanent injunction against NREIS \"engaging in any of the activities which constitute a conveyance of real property unless they are acting under the supervision or control of a Massachusetts attorney.\" REBA did not seek monetary damages.</p>\n<p>On February 6, 2007, NREIS removed the action, under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, to the federal district court in Massachusetts on diversity grounds. REBA agreed to dismiss from the original case the one nondiverse defendant, a Massachusetts attorney.</p>\n<p>At the same time, NREIS filed in the federal district court an answer to REBA's complaint denying REBA's allegations and asserting what it styled as a counterclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The counterclaim sought (1) declaratory judgment that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46A, \"if interpreted against NREIS as plaintiff contends, violates the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution,\" (2) an injunction against REBA \"preventing NREIS from engaging in interestate commerce free from restrictive state action,\" and (3) attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Certification of REBA's Claim to the SJC</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first vacate the district court's entry of judgment against REBA on its unauthorized-practice-of-law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> claim. The district court interpreted state law and held that NREIS's activities do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46, 46A. We certify questions regarding REBA's claim to the SJC.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts certification rule provides for certification \"if there are involved in any proceeding before [the federal court] questions of law of this State which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decision of this court.\" Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 § 1; <i>see also </i><i>Hundley v.

Should the SJC decide that the activities NREIS has engaged in do not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, that \"may be determinative\" of this case.</p>\n<p>There is no controlling precedent from the SJC. A 1935 opinion of the SJC, <i>In re Opinion of the Justices,</i> notes that the practice of law \"embraces conveyancing.\" 194 N.E. at 317. But there is no controlling precedent that establishes a definition for \"conveyancing\" or the extent of activities that constitute conveyancing. The district court correctly noted that there was no SJC precedent \"directly on point\" on what activities constituted conveyancing and that \"the SJC has not explicitly addressed whether the practice of law embraces all the interconnected activities of a real estate conveyance.\" <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 142-43. The district court was also correct to note that state law provided little \"guidance as to the level of involvement an attorney must have\" in the conveyancing activities. <i>Id.</i> at 143.</p>\n<p>Of course, \"even in the absence of controlling precedent, certification would be inappropriate where state law is sufficiently clear to allow us to predict its course.\" <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 53. This is not such a case. The district court's conclusion that the statute has not been violated is at least in tension with the view of the two state trial court determinations in Massachusetts, and perhaps one determination by a single SJC justice. REBA cites a decision by a single justice in a disciplinary case, <i>In re Eric Levine,</i> No. BD-2002-075, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5214985</span></span> (Mass. St. Bar Disp. Bd.2004), which found a suspended attorney had engaged in the practice of law when the attorney continued to provide closing services following his suspension, even though a licensed attorney attended the actual closings. <i>Id.</i> at *2. These opinions, as the district court recognized, are not opinions of the full SJC and so are not dispositive. <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 142.</p>\n<p>NREIS, in turn, relies on several SJC opinions holding that certain other economic activities, such as filling in tax forms, preparing a reaffirmation form in a bankruptcy proceeding, and conducting research on real estate titles in the registry of deeds and then reporting and making recommendations to a lawyer based on the research, did not constitute the practice of law. <i>See </i><i>In re Chimko,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span>, 321-22 (2005); <i>Goldblatt v.

Apart from the lack of certainty in state law, it is especially appropriate to certify this question to the SJC because whether NREIS's various activities here constitute the unauthorized practice of law raises serious policy concerns regarding the practice of law that will certainly impact future cases. Such policy judgments are best left to the SJC, which is responsible for defining the practice of law in Massachusetts. <i>See </i><i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 57; <i>Boston Gas Co.,</i> 529 F.3d at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the interests of federalism are best served by certification.

The counterclaim stated what appeared to be a conventional defense: that if REBA's interpretation of the state statute were adopted by the court then the statute, as so interpreted (presumably by a court), would violate the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>The counterclaim, however, also alleged that \"[t]he Amended Complaint by plaintiff and its interpretation of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 46A], is an act of economic protectionism by Massachusetts lawyers against out-of-state competition for settlement services.\" This could be read to allege an unusual theory, that the filing of the complaint alleging unauthorized practice was itself a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>REBA read the counterclaim to embody the first argument. It argued to the district court that the statute, if interpreted by a court to prohibit NREIS's activities, would not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, thus interpreting the theory as a conventional defense. Under that argument, if the court did not interpret the statute to apply to NREIS's activities, then the Commerce Clause claim would be hypothetical and not be reached. NREIS, however, argued it was entitled to an injunction and declaratory relief against REBA, mixing both readings of what its theory was. In a <i>reply</i> brief, NREIS said it sought an injunction based on REBA's advocacy of its theory in the litigation, the second reading.</p>\n<p>The district court took up the second theory and enjoined REBA \"from enforcing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> on NREIS its <i>interpretation</i> of the practice of law as encompassing (1) all the interconnected activities of a real estate conveyance and (2) the issuance of title insurance.\" <i>REBA I,</i> 609 F.Supp.2d at 147 (emphasis added). The court held that NREIS \"is entitled to a declaratory judgment that REBA's <i>interpretation</i> of the practice of law as encompassing all the interconnected steps of a real estate conveyance violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The court said its \"holding address[ed] the constitutionality of REBA's interpretation of what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law . . ., not the constitutionality of sections 46 and 46A themselves.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 147 n. 91.</p>\n<p>The district court thus held that REBA's actions in bringing a suit before a state court seeking an adjudication that certain activities violated a state statute were themselves a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. More specifically, the court held that REBA's <i>advocacy</i> of the particular position in state court that NREIS's activities violated the state law was a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>After the court issued the injunction, REBA argued at the hearing on attorney's fees that there had been nothing to enjoin because the court had found no violation of the statute and so the issue of whether enforcement of the statute would violate the dormant Commerce Clause was not before the court. REBA also said there was nothing left for the court to \"enjoin\" given the court's ruling. REBA also argued it should not be enjoined for its advocacy in filing a lawsuit, nor should it be made to pay attorney's fees. The court rejected those arguments (and did so without explanation). <i>REBA II,</i> 642 F.Supp.2d at 64.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The District Court Erred as a Matter of Law in Affording Relief to NREIS</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>No § 1983 Claim Was Stated because REBA Is Not a State Actor</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Unless REBA was a \"state actor\" there can be no § 1983 claim against REBA. <i>Tomaiolo v.

In <i>Violet</i> there was a judicial determination that an unauthorized-practice-of-law statute applied to certain debt collection practices. <i>Id.</i> at 288. The issue was whether the statute, as interpreted and applied to the plaintiff, violated the Commerce Clause, as the plaintiff had asserted in defense. <i>Id.</i> A divided panel of this court held that such an application constituted a Commerce Clause violation. <i>Id.</i> at 290. This was an utterly conventional application of a Commerce Clause defense.</p>\n<p>In this case there was no judicial determination that the statute applied to NREIS, only a nonfrivolous argument by REBA that it did, and REBA cannot be found to have acted unconstitutionally by making that argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Injunction Violated REBA's First Amendment Right to Petition</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is an even more fundamental problem with the award of injunctive and declaratory relief based on REBA's having filed suit in state court.

The filing of such suits adds legitimacy to the court system as the designated forum to resolve disputes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court's issuance of the injunction and declaratory relief transgressed those First Amendment principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>NREIS's Claim REBA Waived the Arguments that It Is Not a State Actor and that It Is Entitled to First Amendment Protections Fails</i>\n</h2>\n<p>NREIS argues REBA has waived any argument as to its status as a state actor or its entitlement to First Amendment protection and that this court cannot, as a result, reach either issue. It is true that REBA did not argue to the district court that it was not a state actor or that its actions in bringing suit and in advocating as it did were protected by the First Amendment. We have no need to address whether NREIS had some obligation to warn the court of the First Amendment hazards of its theory. Had either side done so, the district court might, forewarned, have stayed its hand.</p>\n<p>NREIS's pleadings were unclear, and it appears to have refocused its Commerce Clause theory from a conventional defense that enforcement of an applicable statute against it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause to a claim that the mere bringing of suit under §§ 46 and 46A alleging a violation was itself prohibited by the Commerce Clause. Because of the confusion caused by NREIS's pleadings and briefing, REBA's arguments did not address the theory on which the district court ultimately granted relief against it. For this reason alone, we decline to find waiver on the First Amendment argument.</p>\n<p>Even if there were waiver, we would excuse it. It is a matter of discretion in this court whether to reach the issues. <i>Montalvo v.

In deciding whether to reach issues we have considered: whether the litigant's failure to raise the issue has deprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding, or whether the issue was of a purely legal nature; whether the argument was highly persuasive and failure to reach it would threaten a miscarriage of justice; whether considering the issue would cause prejudice or inequity to the adverse party; whether the failure to raise the issue was inadvertent and provided no advantage; whether the issue was of constitutional magnitude; and whether the issue implicates a matter of great public concern. <i>Montalvo,</i> 587 F.3d at 48-49; <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627-28.</p>\n<p>Both the state action and First Amendment issues satisfy our criteria. REBA gained no advantage in failing to raise these issues. REBA's failure to argue it was not a state actor before the district court and its effort to raise the issue on appeal did not deprive this court of any useful factfinding, nor does it prejudice NREIS. <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627-28.</p>\n<p>As to the First Amendment issue, it is clearly one of \"constitutional magnitude.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628. It is also an issue of great <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> public concern, <i>id.,</i> having significance to the administration of justice in the federal courts. No party bringing suit should fear that its nonfrivolous advocacy of a reasonable position in federal court will, on that basis alone, lead to an injunction and declaration against it based on the dormant Commerce Clause. Much less should a party be made, based on its conduct in bringing such a suit, to fear the imposition of attorney's fees. Further, this is a pure issue of law; no party is harmed by the absence of fact finding. <i>Id.</i> at 627-28. The law is quite clear and this court has received the benefit of briefing on the issue from NREIS and the amicus Boston Bar Association.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>This brings us to the appropriate relief. We vacate the judgment of the district court entering judgment against REBA, reverse all relief awarded on the counterclaim and vacate the award of attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n<p>We certify the questions specified below to the SJC:</p>\n<p>1. Whether NREIS's activities, either in whole or in part, based on the record in this case and as described in the parties' filings, constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>2. Whether NREIS's activities, in contracting with Massachusetts attorneys to attend closings, violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, §§ 46 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other relevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in the proper resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p>The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the Massachusetts SJC, under the official seal of this court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision in this case, along with a copy of the briefs and appendix filed by the parties in the federal proceeding and the district court record, which set forth all facts relevant to the issues certified. We retain jurisdiction over REBA's claims pending the SJC's determination. The case shall be stayed until receipt of the response of the SJC.</p>\n<p>Costs of this appeal are awarded to REBA.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"An `integrated' bar is an association of attorneys in which membership and dues are required as a condition of practicing law in the jurisdiction.\" <i>Schneider v.

REBA did not choose to have the state law question decided by a federal court. NREIS made that decision through removal. The existence of diversity sufficient to permit the exercise of federal jurisdiction is an insufficient reason to deprive the SJC of its normal role as arbiter of what constitutes the practice of law in Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>NREIS argues that REBA failed to move for certification to the SJC in the district court and for that reason we must have a compelling reason to certify. This factor is one of many to be considered in the exercise of our discretion. <i>See </i><i>Boston Car Co., Inc. v. Acura Auto. Div., Am.

This court has discretion to certify questions to the SJC when a party fails to move for certification in the district court, or to do so sua sponte. <i>Hundley,</i> 603 F.3d at 98; <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 57 n. 10; <i>Me.

The arguments for certification in this case are compelling.</p>\n<p>NREIS also argues that REBA raises a theory in its petition for certification that REBA did not present to the district court: that the individual steps in a real estate transaction, and not just the process as a whole, constitute the practice of law. We decline to reach this question.</p>\n<p>[3]  Based upon these findings, the court concluded that NREIS was a prevailing party in a § 1983 action and awarded attorney's fees and costs of $904,076.17 against REBA under § 1988. Because we vacate the findings of liability on all theories, NREIS cannot be a prevailing party, and it is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p>[4]  The parties have not briefed this question, and so we vacate the district court's holding on other grounds. We note, however, that the assertion that a statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause can be and usually is raised as an affirmative defense, as NREIS also did in this case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sadler v.

There, a Committee of the Bar Association sent a letter requesting that plaintiff cease and desist from the practice of law. <i>Id.</i> at 197. The district court held that this was insufficient to make the association a state actor. <i>Id.</i> This court held that even if the bar association were a state actor, the association would enjoy either absolute immunity like prosecutors or qualified immunity like government officials. <i>Id.</i> at 198.</p>\n<p>[7]  We do not consider whether, if REBA were a state actor, its filing of the lawsuit would be protected under the government speech doctrine. <i>See Pleasant Grove City v.
