In a hearing  conducted on\n                              \n\nMay 29, 1990, the appellant, Edward Hager, entered a plea of\n\nguilty to a charge of  unlawfully importing four wild animal\n\npelts  from  Mexico into  the  United States.  16  U.S.C.   \n\n3372(a)(2)(A) (prohibiting importation of wildlife  taken or\n\npossessed  in  violation   of  foreign  law),  3373(d)(1)(A)\n\n(setting  criminal  penalties for  violation).   Immediately\n\nafter  the hearing, the  court sentenced Hager  to serve one\n\nyear of  unsupervised probation and  to pay a  $75,000 fine.\n\nHe  did not  appeal the  court's judgment.   On  November 2,\n\n1992, he asked the district  court to issue a writ  of coram\n\nnobis,  setting  aside his  conviction.    See 28  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n1651(a)(\"All Writs Act\"); United  States v. Morgan, 346 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n502, 512 (1954).  The district court denied the petition for\n\nthe writ.  And, Hager appeals the court's decision.\n\n          Hager  makes  one argument  on  this  appeal.   He\n\npoints  out  that the  district  court,  before accepting  a\n\nguilty plea, must make certain that the defendant's \"plea is\n\nvoluntary.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d); see also North Carolina\n                                                            \n\nv. Alford, 400 U.S.  25, 31 (1970) (plea must  be \"voluntary\n         \n\nand  intelligent choice  among  the alternative  courses  of\n\naction open to  the defendant\").   Hager says  that, in  his\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ncase, the district court  failed to make this determination.\n\nThe court asked him \n\n          \"Now, have  there been any  threats made\n          by anyone  against  you, any  member  of\n          your family, or anyone  near and dear to\n          you which compels you to offer a plea of\n          guilty here this morning?\"\n\nThe appellant replied,\n\n          \"Only the threat to my health, sir.\"\n\nHow,  asks  the appellant,  could  the  district court  know\n\nenough about the matter after this brief exchange to satisfy\n\nitself that the \"threat\" to his \"health\" was not so grave as\n\nto make his plea essentially involuntary?  Unless there is a\n\nsatisfactory answer  to this question, he  adds, his \"guilty\n\nplea\"  proceeding  was so  seriously  flawed  as to  warrant\n\nissuance of the coram nobis writ.  \n\n          The legal answer  to appellant's question  is that\n\nthe  writ of  coram nobis  is an  unusual legal  animal that\n\ncourts  will  use  to  set  aside  a  criminal  judgment  of\n\nconviction only \"under  circumstances compelling such action\n\nto  achieve justice.\"  See  Morgan, 346 U.S.  at 511.  Those\n                                  \n\ncircumstances include  an explanation  of why a  coram nobis\n\npetitioner did  not earlier  seek relief from  the judgment,\n\nsee  United States v. Osser, 864 F.2d 1056, 1061-62 (3d Cir.\n                           \n\n1988), Kiger v. United States, 315 F.2d 778, 779 (7th Cir.),\n                             \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\ncert.  denied,  375  U.S. 924  (1963);  a  showing that  the\n             \n\npetitioner  continues  to   suffer  significant   collateral\n\nconsequences from the judgment, see Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512-\n                                          \n\n13, Howard v.  United States,  962 F.2d 651,  653 (7th  Cir.\n                            \n\n1992);  and  a demonstration  that  an  error of  \"the  most\n\nfundamental  character,\"  relevant  to  the  plea  decision,\n\noccurred. See Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512. \n                    \n\n          The appellant has neither explained why he did not\n\npursue  a timely  appeal nor  shown  significant, continuing\n\ncollateral consequences  flowing from his conviction.   And,\n\nhe has  conceded the following facts: (1) at the time of the\n\nplea hearing,  the district court  was aware of  his medical\n\nproblems, both from the record of earlier proceedings in the\n\ncase  prior  to  its  transfer to  New  Hampshire  and  from\n\nappellant's own description of  these problems, later in the\n\ncourse  of the hearing; (2) when asked whether there was any\n\nreason  why the  court should  not accept  appellant's plea,\n\nappellant replied  that there  was not,  see  Key v.  United\n                                                            \n\nStates,  806  F.2d 133,  136  (7th  Cir. 1986)  (defendant's\n      \n\nrepresentations  at   plea   hearing  strong   obstacle   to\n\nsuccessful collateral attack on conviction); (3) appellant's\n\ncounsel,  in response  to  the court's  inquiry, stated  his\n\nopinion  that  the plea  was in  the  best interests  of his\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nclient, see United States  v. Guichard, 779 F.2d  1139, 1145\n                                      \n\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1127 (1986) (unless overt\n                        \n\ncoercion  alleged,   counsel's  opinion  good   evidence  of\n\nvoluntary  and intelligent  plea), citing  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nAraiza,  693  F.2d 382,  385 (5th  Cir.  1982); and  (4) the\n      \n\ngovernment demonstrated at the coram nobis proceeding before\n\nthe district court that, two months after entering his plea,\n\nappellant was well enough  to travel to Africa to  hunt wild\n\nanimals.     These   facts,  together,   convince   us  that\n\nappellant's  plea was  not \"involuntary;\"  that the  court's\n\nfailure  to  ask  more   health-related  questions  was  not\n\nerroneous; and,  certainly, that no error  of a \"fundamental\n\ncharacter\" occurred.  See  Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512;  Fed. R.\n                                 \n\nCrim. P. 11(h)  (no redress for Rule 11 error which does not\n\nviolate  substantial rights); cf. United States v. Timmreck,\n                                                           \n\n441  U.S.  780,  784   (1979)  (to  justify  habeas  relief,\n\nviolation  of  Rule  11  must be  \"complete  miscarriage  of\n\njustice\"  or  \"omission  inconsistent with  the  rudimentary\n\ndemands of fair procedure,\" not just technical violation).\n\n          The judgment  of  the district  court denying  the\n\npetition for a writ of coram nobis is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n",
