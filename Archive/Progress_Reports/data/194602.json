Andre Lopez Polanco  was convicted of\n                    \n\nsentence.   He  now  appeals  the  district  court's  summary\nand  abetting  the  possession   with  intent  to  distribute\nconspiring to distribute cocaine and of possessing and aiding\nconspiring to  possess  with  intent  to  distribute  and  of\n\ndismissal of his motion.  We affirm.\nPolanco brought a motion under 28 U.S.C.   2255 to vacate his\ncocaine.   After  we  confirmed  his  conviction  on  appeal,\n\nit did not tell the jury what its final decision was; (3) the\nfollowing grounds for  relief:  (1)  he received  ineffective\n\ntelephone conversation; (2) the district court told the  jury\nchallenge the court's admission of testimony about a  certain\nassistance of counsel because his appellate attorney did  not\n\nfinal ruling after all  the evidence had been  presented, but\nthat it would admit  that testimony conditionally and make  a\n\nfour-level increase  in his  base offense  level for  being a\n          In his  section 2255  motion,  Polanco alleged  the\n\ntestimony of  witnesses hoping  to receive  lesser sentences,\n\nhave  distributed  was  calculated  by  adding  together  the\na  conviction\"; (4) the quantity of cocaine he was alleged to\n\namounts the government's  witnesses stated they  had received\nrendering  such testimony \"a form of coercion in order to get\n\ntwo-level  increase  in  offense  level  for  obstruction  of\nfrom him, amounts which  could have been fabricated;  (5) the\nleader  and organizer was wrong  because it was  based on the\n\njustice,  which the  court  based on  his  perjury at  trial,\nviolated his  \"right to  self-defense\"; and (6)  the district\n\ncourt did not hold an evidentiary hearing.  \n\n          We   have   stated   that  summary   dismissal   is\n\nappropriate when a section 2255 petition is inadequate on its\n\nface, or is conclusively  refuted as to the alleged  facts by\n\nthe files and records of the case.

Summary dismissal\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing is also proper  if the grounds\n\nfor   relief   stated   in   the   motion    are   conclusory\n\ngeneralizations    or   assertions    without   \"sufficiently\n\nparticular  and supportive  allegations of fact\"  showing why\n\nhabeas  relief is warranted.  Id.; see also Bernier v. Moore,\n                                                            \n\n441  F.2d 395,  396 (1st  Cir. 1971)  (per curiam);  Aubut v.\n                                                          \n\nMaine,  431 F.2d 688, 689 (1st Cir. 1970).  Because Polanco's\n     \n\nmotion is inadequate on its face, presenting claims which are\n\neither refuted as  to alleged facts by the record, conclusory\n\nor  otherwise  without  merit,  we affirm  the  dismissal  of\n\nPolanco's petition.  \n\n          1.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n                                               \n\n          Polanco alleges that his appellate counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance  by not challenging the  trial court's\n\nadmission of testimony about a certain telephone conversation\n\nwhich Polanco  alleges was hearsay.   A claim  of ineffective\n\nassistance of  counsel is properly  raised in a  section 2255\n\nmotion,  see United States v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 100 (1st\n                                      \n\n                             -3-\n\nCir.   1990),  but   Polanco's  claim   fails  for   lack  of\n\nspecificity.   Polanco provides  no identifying details about\n\nthe conversation he is  referring to, and does not  say which\n\nwitness testified  about  the  conversation.    Although  the\n\ntranscripts submitted to this court contain testimony about a\n\ntelephone conversation which is probably the one in question,\n\nother  trial  transcripts were  not  made  available to  this\n\ncourt, and so we  cannot know for sure that  the conversation\n\nin  the transcripts we have is the relevant conversation.  In\n\nany  event,  Polanco  does   not  explain  how  admission  of\n\ntestimony  about that telephone  conversation prejudiced him,\n\nand  prejudice  is  not  apparent from  the  record.    Three\n\nwitnesses independently testified  that Polanco had  provided\n\nthem with cocaine, which they distributed, that they had paid\n\nthe proceeds  from their cocaine  sales to Polanco,  and that\n\nthey  had made  out-of-state trips  with Polanco  to  pick up\n\ncocaine for distribution within the state.  That evidence was\n\nsufficient to convict him of the drug charges against him.   \n\n          We  have said that  it is well  within the district\n\ncourt's  discretion to  decline  to hold  a  hearing where  a\n\nhabeas petitioner merely states what counsel's alleged act or\n\nomission is  without  explaining why  it  constituted  \"gross\n\nimpropriety or prejudicial misconduct.\"  Bernier, 441 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n396.  This is so even  where the petitioner is proceeding pro\n\n                             -4-\n\nse.  Id.  Because Polanco did not provide any factual details\n        \n\nto support  his claim  of ineffective assistance  of counsel,\n\nand the  record suggests  that no  such facts  exist, summary\n\ndismissal was appropriate.\n\n          2.  Remaining Claims\n                              \n\n          In view of the fact that Polanco's remaining claims\n\nhave  no merit and have  been waived, as  described below, we\n\nneed not  consider  whether they  are properly  brought in  a\n\nsection 2255 proceeding.  \n\n          Polanco complains  that the district  court did not\n\nconfirm  for  the  jury   that  certain  testimony  had  been\n\ncorrectly  admitted,  but  he  does  not  describe  how  that\n\nomission  prejudiced him.   Nor  can we  see how  the court's\n\nfailure to  confirm at the  conclusion of trial  that certain\n\nevidence  had  been properly  admitted could  have prejudiced\n\nPolanco.    Had the  court determined  that  it had  erred in\n\nadmitting the evidence, and then failed to inform the jury of\n\nits decision, obviously Polanco could have been prejudiced by\n\nthe jury's consideration of the improperly admitted evidence.\n\nHere, however, the  evidence was found to have  been properly\n\nadmitted, and so the jury's consideration of the evidence was\n\nentirely appropriate  and the court's failure  to verify that\n\ncould not have prejudiced Polanco.  \n\n        Polanco  also claims  that the  increase in  his base\n\noffense  level for  being a  leader and  organizer  was wrong\n\n                             -5-\n\nbecause  it was based on the testimony of witnesses hoping to\n\nreceive lesser  sentences.   Thus, Polanco does  not actually\n\nchallenge the court's  finding that Polanco was  a leader and\n\norganizer, but  essentially assails  the  credibility of  the\n\nwitnesses  testifying against  him.   On  direct examination,\n\nthose witnesses  described the  nature of their  agreement to\n\ncooperate   with  the   government,  and   Polanco's  counsel\n\nthoroughly cross-examined them on that subject, providing the\n\njury  an  adequate  basis  for  judging   their  credibility.\n\nConsequently, we find no merit in this claim of error.  \n\n        Nor  is  there  merit  in Polanco's  claim  that  the\n\nquantity  of drugs  he allegedly  distributed  was improperly\n\nbased on testimony given at trial.  Polanco's only  challenge\n\nto  that testimony is his bare speculation that it might have\n\nbeen fabricated.  Again, Polanco's  counsel vigorously cross-\n\nexamined   the  witnesses  in   question.    Furthermore,  at\n\nsentencing his counsel conceded that the presentence report's\n\nstatement  of  the amounts  of  drugs distributed  accurately\n\nreflected their testimony.  \n\n        Finally,  Polanco claims that  enhancing his sentence\n\nfor obstruction of justice because of his trial testimony was\n\na violation of his right to testify in his own defense.  That\n\nbare allegation is insufficient to  state a claim for relief.\n\nThe  district  court  determined  that  Polanco  --  who  had\n\ntestified that  he had not  been involved  in any way  in the\n\n                             -6-\n\nalleged  distribution  of cocaine  --  had  committed perjury\n\nduring  the trial.   Polanco  does  not dispute  the district\n\ncourt's finding before  this court.  In  fact, he practically\n\nconfirmed  his perjury  by asking  the district  court before\n\nsentencing whether there was \"some way that I can collaborate\n\nwith the government,\" complaining that no one had  ever asked\n\nhim whether he wished  to collaborate.  Case law  makes clear\n\nthat  a defendant's right to  testify on his  own behalf does\n\nnot include the right  to commit perjury, and thus  Polanco's\n\nclaim must  fail.  See  Nix v. Whiteside,  475 U.S. 157,  173\n                                        \n\n(1986)  (\"Whatever the  scope  of a  constitutional right  to\n\ntestify, it is elementary  that such a right does  not extend\n\nto  testifying  falsely.\")  (emphasis  in  original);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Grayson,  438  U.S. 41,  54  (1978) (\"[t]he  right\n                  \n\nguaranteed by law  to a  defendant is narrowly  the right  to\n\ntestify  truthfully in accordance with  [his] oath .  . . \");\n\nsee  also United States  v. Batista-Polanco, 927  F.2d 14, 22\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir.  1991) (the obstruction of  justice enhancement for\n\nfalsely testifying in one's own defense  does not implicate a\n\nconstitutional  right); United  States v.  Akitoye, 923  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n221,  228  (1st  Cir.   1991)  (the  obstruction  of  justice\n\nenhancement  for  false  trial  testimony does  not  chill  a\n\ndefendant's exercise of sixth amendment rights).\n\n          Finally,  we   note  that,  although   Polanco  was\n\nrepresented  by counsel, he failed  to raise the above claims\n\n                             -7-\n\nin his direct  appeal, thereby waiving  them unless he  shows\n\ncause  and prejudice under  United States v.  Frady, 456 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n152,  167 (1982).  See  United States v.  Biberfeld, 957 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n98, 104 (3d  Cir. 1992) (the  waiver of a section  2255 claim\n\nmay be  excused where  the defendant  shows cause  and actual\n\nprejudice).   Polanco has made  no such showing  and does not\n\nallege that his attorney  rendered him ineffective assistance\n\nof  counsel  in  failing  to raise  these  issues  on appeal.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that summary dismissal of his motion\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing was proper.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -8-\n",

Caggiano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538794\"><a href=\"/opinion/538794/united-states-v-allen-j-caggiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1st\n                                      \n\n                             -3-\n\nCir.   1990),  but   Polanco's  claim   fails  for   lack  of\n\nspecificity.   Polanco provides  no identifying details about\n\nthe conversation he is  referring to, and does not  say which\n\nwitness testified  about  the  conversation.    Although  the\n\ntranscripts submitted to this court contain testimony about a\n\ntelephone conversation which is probably the one in question,\n\nother  trial  transcripts were  not  made  available to  this\n\ncourt, and so we  cannot know for sure that  the conversation\n\nin  the transcripts we have is the relevant conversation.  In\n\nany  event,  Polanco  does   not  explain  how  admission  of\n\ntestimony  about that telephone  conversation prejudiced him,\n\nand  prejudice  is  not  apparent from  the  record.    Three\n\nwitnesses independently testified  that Polanco had  provided\n\nthem with cocaine, which they distributed, that they had paid\n\nthe proceeds  from their cocaine  sales to Polanco,  and that\n\nthey  had made  out-of-state trips  with Polanco  to  pick up\n\ncocaine for distribution within the state.  That evidence was\n\nsufficient to convict him of the drug charges against him.   \n\n          We  have said that  it is well  within the district\n\ncourt's  discretion to  decline  to hold  a  hearing where  a\n\nhabeas petitioner merely states what counsel's alleged act or\n\nomission is  without  explaining why  it  constituted  \"gross\n\nimpropriety or prejudicial misconduct.\"  Bernier, 441 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n396.  This is so even  where the petitioner is proceeding pro\n\n                             -4-\n\nse.  Id.  Because Polanco did not provide any factual details\n        \n\nto support  his claim  of ineffective assistance  of counsel,\n\nand the  record suggests  that no  such facts  exist, summary\n\ndismissal was appropriate.\n\n          2.  Remaining Claims\n                              \n\n          In view of the fact that Polanco's remaining claims\n\nhave  no merit and have  been waived, as  described below, we\n\nneed not  consider  whether they  are properly  brought in  a\n\nsection 2255 proceeding.  \n\n          Polanco complains  that the district  court did not\n\nconfirm  for  the  jury   that  certain  testimony  had  been\n\ncorrectly  admitted,  but  he  does  not  describe  how  that\n\nomission  prejudiced him.   Nor  can we  see how  the court's\n\nfailure to  confirm at the  conclusion of trial  that certain\n\nevidence  had  been properly  admitted could  have prejudiced\n\nPolanco.    Had the  court determined  that  it had  erred in\n\nadmitting the evidence, and then failed to inform the jury of\n\nits decision, obviously Polanco could have been prejudiced by\n\nthe jury's consideration of the improperly admitted evidence.\n\nHere, however, the  evidence was found to have  been properly\n\nadmitted, and so the jury's consideration of the evidence was\n\nentirely appropriate  and the court's failure  to verify that\n\ncould not have prejudiced Polanco.  \n\n        Polanco  also claims  that the  increase in  his base\n\noffense  level for  being a  leader and  organizer  was wrong\n\n                             -5-\n\nbecause  it was based on the testimony of witnesses hoping to\n\nreceive lesser  sentences.   Thus, Polanco does  not actually\n\nchallenge the court's  finding that Polanco was  a leader and\n\norganizer, but  essentially assails  the  credibility of  the\n\nwitnesses  testifying against  him.   On  direct examination,\n\nthose witnesses  described the  nature of their  agreement to\n\ncooperate   with  the   government,  and   Polanco's  counsel\n\nthoroughly cross-examined them on that subject, providing the\n\njury  an  adequate  basis  for  judging   their  credibility.\n\nConsequently, we find no merit in this claim of error.  \n\n        Nor  is  there  merit  in Polanco's  claim  that  the\n\nquantity  of drugs  he allegedly  distributed  was improperly\n\nbased on testimony given at trial.  Polanco's only  challenge\n\nto  that testimony is his bare speculation that it might have\n\nbeen fabricated.  Again, Polanco's  counsel vigorously cross-\n\nexamined   the  witnesses  in   question.    Furthermore,  at\n\nsentencing his counsel conceded that the presentence report's\n\nstatement  of  the amounts  of  drugs distributed  accurately\n\nreflected their testimony.  \n\n        Finally,  Polanco claims that  enhancing his sentence\n\nfor obstruction of justice because of his trial testimony was\n\na violation of his right to testify in his own defense.  That\n\nbare allegation is insufficient to  state a claim for relief.\n\nThe  district  court  determined  that  Polanco  --  who  had\n\ntestified that  he had not  been involved  in any way  in the\n\n                             -6-\n\nalleged  distribution  of cocaine  --  had  committed perjury\n\nduring  the trial.   Polanco  does  not dispute  the district\n\ncourt's finding before  this court.  In  fact, he practically\n\nconfirmed  his perjury  by asking  the district  court before\n\nsentencing whether there was \"some way that I can collaborate\n\nwith the government,\" complaining that no one had  ever asked\n\nhim whether he wished  to collaborate.  Case law  makes clear\n\nthat  a defendant's right to  testify on his  own behalf does\n\nnot include the right  to commit perjury, and thus  Polanco's\n\nclaim must  fail.  See  Nix v.
