In late 1990, plaintiff  Paul\n                                 \n\nGay, founder  and president of  Plastic Card Systems,  Inc., sold\n\nhis stock in the company to the defendants,  who are PCSI's other\n\nofficers and directors.   In this  securities action, he  alleges\n\nthat   the  defendants   intentionally   failed  to   disclose  a\n\nsubstantial business prospect for  PCSI, causing him to sell  his\n\nstock for substantially less  than its real value.   The district\n\ncourt, following  a bench trial, found  no violation of law.   We\n\naffirm. \n\n                          I. Background\n                                       \n\n     Paul Gay founded  PCSI in  1987 and initially  was its  sole\n\nshareholder,  director  and  officer.    Defendant  Robert Axline\n\njoined the company,  which distributes thermal  printing machines\n\nfor  an Austrian  manufacturer,1 as  a fifty  percent shareholder\n\nand  chief executive  officer  the next  year.   When  the  other\n\ndefendants  became  shareholders in  1990,  Gay  and Axline  each\n\nretained 38.5 percent ownership.\n\n     In late 1988, PCSI collaborated with FIMA S.p.A., an Italian\n\ncompany, to form FIMA USA, Inc. (FIMA USA).  Gay  and Axline each\n\nowned 20  percent of FIMA USA, and  FIMA S.p.A. owned 60 percent.\n\nAxline became president of FIMA USA and Gay became executive vice\n\npresident.   FIMA USA distributed plastic  cards, personalization\n\nequipment for  credit  cards, and  other plastic  card and  metal\n\nplate  devices, as  well as  equipment for producing  such cards.\n\nThe company served as  exclusive marketing agent for  PCSI's line\n\n                    \n\n     1 These machines are used for printing on plastic cards.\n\n                               -2-\n\nof  thermal printers,  and  also  marketed  a line  of  embossing\n\nmachines  for FIMA  S.p.A.   PCSI and  FIMA USA  shared  the same\n\npremises.\n\n     In  mid-1990, FIMA  S.p.A. ordered  Gay's termination  as an\n\nofficer and director  of FIMA  USA.  Gay  remained, however,  the\n\npresident, a  director, and the controlling  shareholder of PCSI.\n\nHe became  entitled to vote the majority of the PCSI shares until\n\nall debt owed by PCSI to him and all debt owed by Axline  to PCSI\n\nwas paid in full.  After  his termination from FIMA USA, Gay went\n\nto the office  only irregularly and,  following a birthday  party\n\nfor him on October 29, he did not return.\n\n     A  few days after the party,  Gay initiated discussions with\n\nAxline about  ending their PCSI relationship.   Axline originally\n\noffered to sell his PCSI  shares to Gay for about $50,000,  their\n\napproximate  book value  at the  time as  calculated by  Gay with\n\nassistance  from   PCSI's  accountant.    The   company's  assets\n\nconsisted virtually entirely of 36 thermal printing machines.  It\n\nhad no  employees, and neither Gay nor Axline placed any value on\n\npossible  projects that were in various stages of discussion.  In\n\nthe course of negotiations, Gay and Axline changed buying/selling\n\npositions and, on about  December 12, they agreed that  Gay would\n\nreceive a total  of $50,000 consideration for his shares ($42,000\n\nin book value and $8,000 in loan forgiveness).  A closing on this\n\ndeal took place on December 20, 1990.\n\n     Meanwhile,  on  November  30,  1990, an  inactive  FIMA  USA\n\ndistributor, Dave Campbell, had called the company asking for the\n\n                               -3-\n\nuse of a PCSI machine for a demonstration for a  possible sale in\n\nMexico.   In subsequent phone  calls early in  December, Campbell\n\nexplained  that  a Kodak  affiliate in  Mexico  was bidding  on a\n\nproject  involving  plastic  voter  identification  cards.     At\n\nCampbell's request, Axline provided a letter detailing FIMA USA's\n\nfinancial  condition and experience with ID cards.  FIMA USA sent\n\nCampbell a machine  for the demonstration,  and a technician  who\n\nregularly worked  as an  independent contractor on  PCSI machines\n\nalso traveled to  Mexico on December  9 to assist.   Campbell had\n\noffered to pay for this technical support.\n\n     The original  indication from  Campbell was that  the Mexico\n\nproject  would involve the  purchase of 17  or 18 machines.   The\n\nnumber increased to 48  by December 4, and eventually grew to 82.\n\nAlthough  Axline   remained  in  contact  with  Campbell  through\n\nDecember, he testified that  he gave little consideration to  the\n\nproject   because  it   seemed   an  unlikely   prospect.     The\n\nspecifications called for processes outside the capability of the\n\nPCSI machines, Kodak was competing with several other contractors\n\nfor the job, and PCSI was competing as subcontractor with a large\n\ncompany  (DataCard) whose  technology was considered  superior to\n\nits own.\n\n     The  nature  of FIMA  USA  and PCSI's  involvement  with the\n\nMexico project  changed  at the  end of  December, when  Campbell\n\ndropped out  as an intermediary  and Axline began  direct contact\n\nwith  Kodak.   On  two occasions  in  early January,  Axline  and\n\nanother FIMA USA  officer, Peter Kline, met with  Kodak officials\n\n                               -4-\n\nin  Rochester.   After  the second  meeting,  which was  held  on\n\nJanuary  10,  FIMA USA  informed  its  Austrian supplier  of  the\n\npossibility of a large sale.  A contract was signed between Kodak\n\nand  the  Mexican  government   on  January  14,  and  defendants\n\ntestified  that they were informed  on January 22  of the Mexican\n\ngovernment's intent to order 82 PCSI machines.  The equipment was\n\nshipped between February and April.\n\n     Gay subsequently filed this securities action, alleging that\n\nthe defendants'  failure to  tell him  about the  Mexican project\n\nbefore the stock closing violated various state and federal laws,\n\nincluding Section 10(b)  of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934,\n\n15  U.S.C.    78j(b), and  SEC Rule  10b-5.   He claims  that, if\n\ndefendants had disclosed the  deal, he would have waited  to sell\n\nhis stock, and would have received substantially more for it.\n\n     The  district court  denied  a motion  for summary  judgment\n\nfiled  by  defendants because  an  affidavit from  a  former PCSI\n\nemployee,  Sobieski,  suggested   that  defendants   deliberately\n\nwithheld  from Gay all information about the Mexican project.  In\n\na  footnote to its pretrial order, however, the court noted that,\n\n\"[a]s  stated  in Court  on  January 26,  1993  [the date  of the\n\nunrecorded summary judgment hearing], the facts as stated  in the\n\ndefendant's  motion  for  summary judgment  are  deemed  admitted\n\nexcept  as specifically controverted  by the plaintiff.\"   In the\n\ncourt's  view, all that remained to be resolved was the affiant's\n\ncredibility, which would lead to a finding of  who knew what, and\n\nwhen, regarding the Mexican project. \n\n                               -5-\n\n     Following a non-jury trial, the court found that the Mexican\n\nproject  was  in such  a preliminary  stage  at the  time  of the\n\nclosing that  it was  not \"material\" information  that defendants\n\nhad  an obligation to disclose  under either Rule  10b-5 or state\n\nfiduciary duty standards.   The court found incredible Sobieski's\n\ntestimony that  defendants took  measures to conceal  the project\n\nfrom  Gay.  It therefore  granted judgment for  defendants on all\n\nclaims.\n\n     On appeal,  Gay asserts  that the district  court's judgment\n\nsuffers from both procedural and substantive defects.  First,  he\n\nargues  that the district  court improperly considered affidavits\n\nand  depositions  that  were  submitted in  connection  with  the\n\nsummary judgment motion  but were not  admitted into evidence  at\n\ntrial.   Second, he  contends that the  district court improperly\n\nresolved factual  disputes at  the summary judgment  hearing, and\n\nerred in excluding  those issues  from the trial.   Finally,  Gay\n\ncontests  the  district  court's  determination  that  defendants\n\nviolated neither federal securities  law nor state fiduciary duty\n\nstandards.\n\n                      II. Procedural Matters\n                                            \n\n     Gay  claims that the district court  mishandled this case in\n\ntwo ways.  In  our view, these asserted problems, even  if error,\n\nneither  undermine  the  court's decision  nor  require  extended\n\ndiscussion.\n\n     A. Depositions and Affidavits.\n                                  \n\n                               -6-\n\n     The district  court stated in its opinion  that, in reaching\n\nits   decision,   it   had  considered   depositions   and   \"the\n\nuncontroverted  portions  of affidavits\"  that were  submitted in\n\nsupport  of  defendants'  motion   for  summary  judgment.    Gay\n\ncomplains that these materials were not admitted into evidence at\n\ntrial, that  they constituted inadmissible hearsay,  and that the\n\ncourt's reliance on them therefore was reversible error.\n\n     Gay  accepts,  however, that  an  appellate  court will  not\n\nreverse a  trial court in a non-jury  case based on the admission\n\nof incompetent evidence  unless it appears  from the record  that\n\nthe  court relied upon that evidence to make an essential finding\n\nthat otherwise would not  have been made.  See  generally Hampton\n                                                                 \n\nSchool Dist. v. Dobrowolski,  976 F.2d 48, 52-53 (1st  Cir. 1992)\n                           \n\n(district  court  judgment will  not  be  reversed for  technical\n\nerrors  that do  not affect  substantial rights of  the parties);\n\nDaSilva v. American  Brands, Inc.,  845 F.2d 356,  363 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1988)  (retrial  not required  when  erroneous  findings are  not\n\nprejudicial).   Gay  identifies only  a single  deposition and  a\n\nlimited series of findings as problematic.\n\n     Scott Pomerantz, the head of  the Mexican project for Kodak,\n\nwas deposed but did not testify  at trial.  The district  court's\n\nopinion  included  the  following  statements  about  FIMA  USA's\n\nprospects early in January:\n\n     Pomerantz  had not  made any  decision as to  who would\n     supply the machines if Kodak were awarded the contract.\n     Kodak  was  competing with  at  least  two other  prime\n     contractors, and  FIMA USA  was competing  with another\n     subcontractor,  DataCard  Corporation,  a   very  large\n\n                               -7-\n\n     competitor with technology considered more suitable for\n     the project.\n\nGay contends that these  were \"critical findings relating  to the\n\nstate of mind of  Kodak and Pomerantz,\" that they  evidently were\n\ndrawn  from Pomerantz'  inadmissible  deposition,  and that  they\n\nunfairly  led the  court to  conclude that  PCSI was  unlikely to\n\nobtain the Kodak subcontract.\n\n     Whether or  not  the district  court  considered  Pomerantz'\n\ndeposition  in  making  these  findings  is  immaterial   because\n\ntestimony  elicited  at  trial  warranted  the  same  inferences.\n\nAxline  testified  that, at  the time  he  and Kline  traveled to\n\nRochester  on January 2, 1990, they knew that they were competing\n\nwith DataCard.  He stated  that he saw DataCard equipment  at the\n\nKodak facility, and was  told by Kodak officials that  they still\n\nwere considering DataCard.  \n\n     Kline also  testified that the  Rochester trip on  January 2\n\nwas  for the purpose of demonstrating that the PCSI machine could\n\nperform as well  as DataCard's, which apparently was preferred at\n\nthat  time  because  it  was  believed  to have  better  printing\n\nquality.  Because Pomerantz  was the person with whom  Axline and\n\nKline  dealt in Rochester, the court properly could find based on\n\ntheir  testimony that Pomerantz had not yet decided which company\n\nwould supply the machines if Kodak won the Mexican contract.\n\n     Thus, regardless of the propriety of the court's reliance on\n\nsummary judgment  depositions and  affidavits --  and we  make no\n\nruling on  that issue -- no reversible  error occurred.  The only\n\n                               -8-\n\nfindings  that Gay  identifies as  crucial were  otherwise proven\n\nthrough admissible evidence.\n\n     2. Disputed facts at summary judgment  \n                                          \n\n     As  noted  earlier, see  supra  at 5,  the  district court's\n                                   \n\npretrial  order stated  that all  facts contained  in defendants'\n\nmotion for  summary judgment  and  not specifically  controverted\n\nwould be deemed admitted.   The court, however, did not  list any\n\nparticular facts as already determined.  At the opening of trial,\n\nthe  court  observed  that  the proceeding  was  being  held  \"to\n\nconclude  the fact  finding,\"  and indicated  that the  remaining\n\nfactual dispute concerned Sobieski's testimony; specifically, was\n\nSobieski  telling  the  truth  in charging  that  the  defendants\n\nconcealed  the  Mexico project  from Gay  knowing  that it  was a\n\nlucrative opportunity for PCSI.2\n\n     Gay  claims  that,  in  confining the  trial  to  Sobieski's\n\ncredibility, the district court  essentially found disputed facts\n\non the motion for summary judgment, thus improperly denying him a\n\nfull hearing  on his claims.   He points to three  issues that he\n\nbelieves were improperly found at the summary judgment stage:\n\n     *DataCard remained in contention  to supply the machines for\n\nthe Mexican project until mid-January 1991;\n\n                    \n\n     2 Sobieski testified that he had been instructed not to tell\nGay anything about the Mexican project because \"there was [a] lot\nof money for all to be made in this deal . . . [a]nd he no longer\nwas a part of the company.\"  He also claimed to have been told to\ntake  various security measures to limit Gay's access to the PCSI\noffice  and warehouse space, such as fixing window blinds so that\nGay could not see in and keeping certain doors locked \"in case of\nan  unannounced visit.\"   Sobieski  was fired  from PCSI  in 1991\nbecause of insubordination and poor job performance.\n\n                               -9-\n\n     *the  project was unlikely for FIMA USA and PCSI because the\n\nspecifications included  processes outside the capability  of the\n\nPCSI machines; and\n\n     *pricing  information was first  submitted to Kodak's Mexico\n\naffiliate on January 16, 1991.\n\n     We think  it unnecessary to explore the proper boundaries of\n\nthe district court's authority  to resolve these issues following\n\nthe  summary  judgment hearing  because  any  such findings  were\n\nrevisited fully  at trial,3 and  Gay was given  ample opportunity\n\nto disprove them.   During the course of the  two-day proceeding,\n\nthe district court heard extensive testimony about all aspects of\n\nthe  Mexican deal from  the principals of  FIMA USA and  PCSI, as\n\n                    \n\n     3 Indeed, it is not clear that the court actually viewed the\nfacts contested  by Gay as  having been found before  trial.  The\ncourt at one point  described broadly the matters that  needed to\nbe explored at trial:\n\n     Motions for summary judgment . . . were denied  because\n     there was an issue of fact; that is,  what Mr. Gay knew\n     and when  did he know it and who told him, and what Mr.\n     Axline and others knew and what they concealed from Mr.\n     Gay,  if they did, and the role that Mr. Sobieski plays\n     in this case.\n\nThe judge later noted  that it was unnecessary to  hear testimony\non the background facts concerning Gay's founding of PCSI and his\nrelationship with  the company because \"[w]e all  know that. That\nwas undisputed.\"  He went on: \n\n          The question now is  what happened in November and\n     December of  1990, what was  concealed from Mr.  Gay by\n     Axline and others,  and what they said to  Mr. Sobieski\n     about his role.\n\n                               -10-\n\nwell as from the plaintiff and his witnesses.  Each  of the three\n\npoints raised as crucial by Gay was addressed.4 \n\n     We  already have  noted evidence  identifying DataCard  as a\n\ncompetitor  of PCSI's through at  least the beginning of January.\n\nSee supra at 7-8.  Whether that status continued for another week\n         \n\nor so is of no consequence, since the crucial  point of reference\n\nis   the  December  20th  closing.    As  for  the  date  pricing\n\ninformation was provided to Kodak, the district court heard ample\n\ntestimony explaining that the pricing originally was done through\n\nthe distributor  Campbell and  that  FIMA USA  first submitted  a\n\nprice list directly to  Kodak on January 16th or 17th.   Axline's\n\ntestimony  at trial  also  permitted the  district court  to find\n\nthat, regardless of the  capability of the PCSI machines  to meet\n\nthe specifications of the Mexican project as they ultimately were\n\ndefined, FIMA USA's principals initially felt the deal was beyond\n\ntheir range  because PCSI's  equipment could not  accommodate the\n\nMexican  government's desire to include a photograph on the voter\n\nID card.\n\n     In sum, the district court allowed the parties wide scope in\n\npresenting   evidence  at   trial  notwithstanding   its  limited\n\narticulation of the issues that remained to be resolved.  We have\n\n                    \n\n     4  Gay has not identified any testimony or other evidence on\nthese issues  that he was barred  from presenting as  a result of\nthe district court's pretrial  order.  Indeed, at the  opening of\nthe  trial,  Gay's attorney  noted  his  view that,  despite  the\npretrial order, he  viewed the major  issues as controverted  and\ntherefore sought  to introduce all  of his  proposed 25  exhibits\ninto evidence.   The  court allowed all  the exhibits,  reserving\nruling on their credibility, relevance and weight.  \n\n                               -11-\n\nno  basis  for concluding  that  the court  made  its factfinding\n\nprematurely  on any  significant issues.   Moreover,  at no  time\n\nfollowing  issuance  of  the   amended  pretrial  order  did  Gay\n\nmeaningfully seek reconsideration or clarification of the court's\n\nruling.5     Certainly  in  these  circumstances   there  was  no\n\nreversible error in the court's procedure.\n\n                      III. Securities Claim\n                                           \n\n     To  prevail  with  a  claim  under  section  10(b)  of   the\n\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Act,  and  associated  Rule  10b-5,  a\n\nplaintiff   must  prove   scienter,   a  material   omission   or\n\nmisrepresentation by the  defendant, reliance and  due diligence.\n\nSee Milton  v. Van Dorn Co.,  961 F.2d 965, 969  (1st Cir. 1992);\n                           \n\nHolmes v.  Batson,  583  F.2d 542,  551  (1st Cir.  1978).    The\n                 \n\ndistrict court in  this case reached  only the material  omission\n\nelement.   It concluded  that the information  about the  Mexican\n\nproject known by  the defendants  at the time  of Gay's  December\n\n20th stock closing was not material and that, consequently, their\n\nfailure to disclose it was not actionable.\n\n     Gay argues that the evidence unequivocally demonstrated that\n\nthe  information  was material,  and  he  attributes the  court's\n\n                    \n\n     5  At the end of his pretrial memorandum, following the list\nof  exhibits  to  be introduced  at  trial,  Gay  noted that  the\ndocument  was  filed  in  accordance with  footnote  two  of  the\ndistrict  court's  amended  pretrial  order.    He  then  stated:\n\"Plaintiff objects  to the ruling  in said footnote  and reserves\nhis rights with respect  thereto.\"  A similar statement  was made\nin another memorandum filed with the court before trial.\n\n                               -12-\n\nerroneous conclusion at  least in  part to its  mistaken view  of\n\ncertain  critical  facts.   We  agree  that the  court's  opinion\n\nreflects two relevant factual  mistakes, see infra at 14,  and we\n                                                  \n\nconsequently  have reviewed  the record  and the  court's opinion\n\nwith particular care.  We believe that neither error, nor both in\n\ncombination, is  sufficiently crucial  to  undermine the  court's\n\nfinding on materiality.\n\n     The  standard used  in our  circuit for  determining whether\n\nundisclosed information  is material follows the  formulation set\n\nout by the  Supreme Court  in TSC Industries,  Inc. v.  Northway,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976): \"whether there is `a substantial\n    \n\nlikelihood that,  under all  the circumstances, the  omitted fact\n\nwould have assumed  actual significance in the deliberations of a\n\nreasonable shareholder,'\" SEC v.

As we  recently\n                          \n\nemphasized,  not  every piece  of  relevant  information will  be\n\ndeemed material:\n\n          The   mere  fact  that   an  investor  might  find\n     information interesting or desirable is  not sufficient\n     to   satisfy  the  materiality  requirement.    Rather,\n     information is \"material\" only  if its disclosure would\n     alter  the  \"total  mix\"  of  facts  available  to  the\n     investor and \"if there is a substantial likelihood that\n     a reasonable  shareholder would consider  it important\"\n     to the investment decision.\n\nMilton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).\n      \n\n     We  further  have recognized  that  if  an alleged  omission\n\ninvolves   \"speculative  judgments  about   future  events,\"  id.\n                                                                 \n\n(emphasis omitted), materiality will  depend upon \"a balancing of\n\nboth  the indicated probability that the event will occur and the\n                               \n\n                               -13-\n\nanticipated  magnitude of the event  in light of  the totality of\n                                   \n\nthe  company activity,\"  id. (emphasis  in original).   See  also\n                                                                 \n\nMcDonald,  699  F.2d  at  50.   In  other  words,  the  fact that\n        \n\ndiscussion  has   begun  about  a  project   with  a  potentially\n\nsubstantial impact  on a  company's stock price  ordinarily would\n\nnot be material if the likelihood of its happening were extremely\n\nremote.\n\n     The district  court concluded  that the defendants  were not\n\nrequired  to inform Gay about the Mexican project because, at the\n\ntime  of the  closing,  the  deal  was \"extremely  uncertain  and\n\ncontingent  in  nature.\"     The  court  noted   that  both  \"the\n\nanticipated magnitude  of the sale  and the  probability that  it\n\nwould  occur were both small as of  December 20.\"  The court also\n\ndeemed significant Gay's lack of  interest in other pending  PCSI\n\nprojects of which he was aware.  It observed that Gay consciously\n\nplaced  no   value  on   these  business  opportunities   in  the\n\nnegotiations.\n\n     The  district  court's  analysis  suffers  from two  factual\n\nflaws.  First,  its statement that  the anticipated magnitude  of\n\nthe Mexican  project as of December 20  was small does not square\n\nwith  the undisputed evidence that the  number of machines needed\n\nhad swelled to 48 by early December.  This number exceeded PCSI's\n\ninventory.   Because the  inventory constituted virtually  all of\n\nPCSI's  assets, the  Mexican  project's potential  impact on  the\n\ncompany's  value fairly  could be  described only  as substantial\n\nonce the deal encompassed all of the remaining machines.\n\n                               -14-\n\n     Second, in noting  Gay's lack of  interest in other  ongoing\n\nPCSI  business dealings,  the  court singled  out  a project  for\n\nAmerican  Express.    In fact,  PCSI  was  not  involved in  that\n\nproject.   The American Express deal was the subject of testimony\n\nat trial because it  was a significant opportunity for  FIMA USA,\n\nbut it would have had no effect on PCSI's value.\n\n     In  our view,  these errors  are not  fatal to  the district\n\ncourt's materiality  analysis, which rested much  more heavily on\n\nthe  uncertain nature of the  Mexican project than  on its scope.\n\nThat  the court  erroneously described the  project as  small may\n\nchip  the foundation  of  its analysis,  but  the weight  of  the\n\nprobability  finding prevents its collapse.   See infra at 16-17.\n                                                       \n\nThe mistaken  reference to the American  Express project likewise\n\nhas limited impact.   The  court cited Gay's  failure to  inquire\n\nabout  the progress of that  deal as illustrative  of his general\n\nattitude toward various ongoing business dealings involving PCSI.\n\nAlthough  Gay argues that the American Express project was unique\n\nbecause it was so developed and had great potential (and thus was\n\nmore similar to  the Mexican  deal), the district  court did  not\n\nsingle out the American Express deal on that basis.  It described\n\nAmerican Express  as \"one of  several other  projects during  the\n\npre-closing period which  were more advanced  and more likely  to\n\nbear fruit.\"   The finding for which the  district court used the\n\nAmerican  Express project -- that Gay valued his PCSI stock based\n\nsolely  on  its equipment  inventory  --  remains supported  even\n\nwithout American Express.  See infra at 18.\n                                    \n\n                               -15-\n\n     Having  concluded that  the  court's errors  do not  require\n\nreversal  of its judgment, we now turn  to a more complete review\n\nof  its determination  that  defendants did  not violate  section\n\n10(b) in failing  to disclose  what they knew  about the  Mexican\n\nproject before the December 20th closing.  Our review, of course,\n\nis  only  for clear  error.   See  Crellin Technologies,  Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nEquipmentlease Corp., No.  93-1615, slip op.  at 13-15 (1st  Cir.\n                    \n\nMarch  8,  1994) (findings  in a  bench  trial are  reviewed with\n\n\"considerable  solicitude\"); Gamma  Audio &amp;  Video, Inc.  v. Ean-\n                                                                 \n\nChea,  11 F.3d 1106, 1111  (1st Cir. 1993)  (factual findings and\n    \n\nmixed  questions of  fact  and law  both  reviewed under  clearly\n\nerroneous standard).\n\n     As indicated above, the district court based its materiality\n\nruling on two primary determinations  -- that the probability  of\n\nthe sale  was  small  as  of  December  20th  and  that  Gay  had\n\ndemonstrated  a lack  of interest  in prospective  PCSI projects.\n\nNeither of these can be termed clearly erroneous. \n\n     The Mexican  project first came  to PCSI's attention  in the\n\nphone  call from Campbell, the distributor, on November 30th.  By\n\nthe  time of the closing, three weeks later, the following events\n\nhad  occurred: Michael  Rochette, an  independent  contractor who\n\nworked on  PCSI machines,  had traveled  to Mexico at  Campbell's\n\nrequest and expense to participate, with other  competitors, in a\n\ndemonstration  for  the Mexican  government;  also  at Campbell's\n\nrequest, Axline had faxed a letter containing financial and other\n\nbackground  information about FIMA USA to Mexico; Axline had been\n\n                               -16-\n\nin regular contact with Campbell, from both Campbell's home  base\n\nin Canada  and from  Mexico, throughout  December; the  number of\n\nmachines at stake in  the project had increased from  an original\n\nestimate of 17 or 18 to at least 48.\n\n     There is no evidence that, during this period, Axline or any\n\nother defendant was  given reason  to believe that  FIMA USA  had\n\nmore than a remote chance of obtaining the Mexican business.  The\n\ndemonstration in  which Rochette  participated on  about December\n\n10th included three different Kodak proposals (only one involving\n\nPCSI machines) as  well as efforts by  two other companies.   Not\n\nonly  did Axline and others  testify that they  believed the PCSI\n\nmachines  could  not  perform  the  work,  but  there   also  was\n\nskepticism about Campbell's ability to land a deal in Mexico from\n\nhis  base  in Canada.   See,  e.g.,  Testimony of  Frank Gubello,\n                                  \n\nnational  service manager  for FIMA  USA, Tr.  II, at  88-89 (\"It\n\nsounded kind of fishy  to me . . . . [I]t  just didn't sound like\n\nit was  going to come  off.\").  Axline testified  that FIMA USA's\n\nactivity  in December  simply  was routine  effort  to support  a\n\ndealer: \"It was just another one of those things that  come in on\n\na regular basis which you work on . . . . We gave it very limited\n\npotential.  In fact, [we] didn't think much about it.\"\n\n     Nothing  cited  by  the  plaintiff, with  the  exception  of\n\nSobieski's  affidavit and testimony,  contradicts the defendants'\n\nassertion that the  deal appeared to be no more  than a long shot\n\nuntil  early   January,  after  Axline  and   Kline's  visits  to\n\nRochester.  The  district court found Sobieski's testimony  to be\n\n                               -17-\n\n\"inherently  implausible,\"  and  we will  not  second-guess  this\n\ncredibility judgment.  See  Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc., 11 F.3d at\n                                                     \n\n1115 (\"It is established beyond cavil that the  trial judge is in\n\nthe  best position to assess  the credibility of  witnesses . . .\n\n.\").  The district court's summary of the evidence on probability\n\nis  therefore uncontradicted: \"What little contact the defendants\n\nhad  with the  project prior  to December  20  was merely  in the\n\nnature  of an  inquiry by  a distributor  and a  demonstration of\n\nmachines which  had, as far  as these defendants  were concerned,\n\nvery little chance of ripening into a sale.\"\n\n     Gay claims  that the court improperly  ignored the imminence\n\nof the Mexican government's decision on a contractor,  and argues\n\nthat the court  should have recognized that a reasonable investor\n\nwould have held  his stock  pending the decision.   Although  the\n\nadvantage  of hindsight  gives  this assertion  some appeal,  the\n\ncourt's  supportable conclusion  was  that there  was nothing  of\n\nsubstance to  wait for as of December 20th.  Had the closing been\n\nten days later,  after the  direct contact between  FIMA USA  and\n\nKodak, Gay's point would  be more compelling, even with  no other\n\nevidence  of FIMA USA's chances  of winning the  subcontract.  At\n\nthat  stage, unlike  on  December 20th,  there  was a  basis  for\n\nviewing FIMA USA and PCSI's relationship with the project as more\n\nthan just a distributor's inquiry.6\n\n                    \n\n     6 Gay cites language from SEC.  v. McDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 50\n                                                \n(1st  Cir.  1983),  to  the  effect  that  \"[a]  `reasonable,  if\nspeculative, investor' would consider information indicating even\nthe  possible  occurrence   of  an  event  of  magnitude   to  be\nimportant.\"  This statement did not mean that a major event would\n\n                               -18-\n\n     The court's  assessment of materiality also  was informed by\n\nevidence demonstrating  Gay's lack  of interest in  other pending\n\nPCSI projects.  Although  he remained president of PCSI  until he\n\nsold his stock, Gay stopped coming to the office after October 29\n\nbecause he felt uncomfortable being  in an office where  everyone\n\nelse was employed by FIMA USA.  At no time did  he ask the status\n\nof any of the \"development  ideas and projects\" in which  he knew\n\nPCSI  had a hand  at the  time he and  Axline began to  discuss a\n\nstock buyout,  including a  project with  the United  States Post\n\nOffice that had resulted in the sale of a machine.\n\n     Gay maintains that none of  these other possibilities was as\n\nsignificant in size or as imminent as the Mexican project, and he\n\ninsists that his lack of interest in them is therefore irrelevant\n\nin determining the materiality of the Kodak deal.  In so arguing,\n\nhowever, Gay presumes that  the Mexican project was so  developed\n\nbefore December  20th that it obviously  was distinguishable from\n\nPCSI's  other opportunities.   The  district court,  in rejecting\n\nSobieski's testimony  and  crediting defendants',  found  to  the\n\ncontrary.\n\n     In our view, the evidence  indicating that Campbell's bid on\n\nbehalf  of PCSI  was  a long-shot,  together with  Gay's explicit\n\ntestimony that he was uninterested in \"incipient business ideas,\"\n\n                    \n\nbe  deemed  material within  the meaning  of  Rule 10b-5  even if\nwholly improbable.  In McDonald,  the probability was strong that\n                               \nthe relevant  event  would take  place, see  id. at  49, and  the\n                                                \ncourt's finding was that \"the future event was sufficiently large\nto remain material even  discounting for whatever uncertainty may\nbe thought to have existed.\" Id. at 50.\n                                \n\n                               -19-\n\nsupports  the district  court's finding  that disclosure  of what\n\ndefendants knew  about the  Mexican project  as of  December 20th\n\nwould not have \"alter[ed]  the `total mix' of facts  available to\n\nthe  investor,\" Milton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).  This\n                      \n\nis enough to  foreclose us  from finding that  the court  clearly\n\nerred.  We therefore affirm its judgment on the 10(b) claim.\n\n                     IV. Fiduciary Duty Claim\n                                             \n\n     Gay argues that,  even if the district court  properly found\n\nthat defendants were not required to disclose the Mexican project\n\nunder  Rule  10b-5,  they  still  may  be  found  responsible for\n\nviolating state fiduciary  duty standards.  He  contends that the\n\nburden of  disclosure for fiduciaries under  Massachusetts law is\n\ngreater than that imposed by federal securities law.\n\n     Gay relies heavily on Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New\n                                                                 \n\nEngland,  367  Mass. 578,  328 N.E.2d  505  (1975), in  which the\n       \n\nMassachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court  quoted  language from  an\n\nopinion by  Justice Cardozo  describing the standard  of behavior\n\namong  partners in a joint  venture as \"[n]ot  honesty alone, but\n\nthe punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.\"  367 Mass. at 594.\n\nSee  also Wartski  v. Bedford, 926  F.2d 11,  13 (1st  Cir. 1991)\n                             \n\n(quoting  Donahue).  Gay maintains that,  under the \"punctilio of\n                 \n\nhonor\" standard,  whatever information  defendants had  about the\n\nMexican project  should  have been  disclosed in  advance of  the\n\nstock closing.\n\n     We  cannot agree.    The basic  fiduciary requirement  under\n\nMassachusetts law  is that business partners  and stockholders in\n\n                               -20-\n\nclose  corporations   refrain  from   acting  out   of  \"avarice,\n\nexpediency  or  self-interest  in  derogation of  their  duty  of\n\nloyalty  to  the  other  stockholders and  to  the  corporation,\"\n\nDonahue, 367  Mass.  at  593; 328  N.E.2d  at 515.    In  quoting\n       \n\nCardozo's language, the SJC in Donahue simply  was restating this\n                                      \n\nstrict good  faith standard and  distinguishing it from  what the\n\nSJC viewed as  the lesser  standard of \"good  faith and  inherent\n\nfairness\"  to which directors and stockholders must adhere in the\n\nnormal discharge of their responsibilities.7\n\n     We  see   nothing  to  be  gained  from   discussing,  as  a\n\ncategorical  matter,  whether  the  Massachusetts  fiduciary duty\n\nstandard requires  greater disclosure than  Rule 10b-5.   But see\n                                                                 \n\nSugarman  v.

The court permissibly  found that\n\nit  did not  occur to them  to discuss the  Mexico project simply\n\nbecause of  their good faith  belief that  the project was  not a\n\nrealistic  opportunity for PCSI.   It further found  that Gay was\n\nnot in a disadvantaged position vis-a-vis the defendants because,\n\nas  president and  majority shareholder  of PCSI,  he had  \"every\n\nopportunity to  look after his  own interests.\"   Defendants  had\n\nneither   superior  business   knowledge  nor   more  substantial\n\nexperience than Gay, a well educated businessman  who was advised\n\nthroughout the negotiations process by a lawyer and accountant.8\n\n     In  short,  Gay  has failed  to  prove  a  violation of  the\n\nstandard of \"utmost  good faith and loyalty,\" Donahue,  367 Mass.\n                                                     \n\nat 593.

A. David Mazzone, Senior U.S. District Judge ]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gerald H. Abrams for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steven E. Kramer for appellees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.Mass.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Torruella, Circuit Judge, Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge, and Boudin, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1990, plaintiff Paul Gay, founder and president of Plastic Card Systems, Inc., sold his stock in the company to the defendants, who are PCSI's other officers and directors.  In this securities action, he alleges that the defendants intentionally failed to disclose a substantial business prospect for PCSI, causing him to sell his stock for substantially less than its real value.  The district court, following a bench trial, found no violation of law.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paul Gay founded PCSI in 1987 and initially was its sole shareholder, director and officer.  Defendant Robert Axline joined the company, which distributes thermal printing machines for an Austrian manufacturer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> as a fifty percent shareholder and chief executive officer the next year.  When the other defendants became shareholders in 1990, Gay and Axline each retained 38.5 percent ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1988, PCSI collaborated with FIMA S.p.A., an Italian company, to form FIMA USA, Inc.  (FIMA USA).  Gay and Axline each owned 20 percent of FIMA USA, and FIMA S.p.A. owned 60 percent.  Axline became president of FIMA USA and Gay became executive vice president.  FIMA USA distributed plastic cards, personalization equipment for credit cards, and other plastic card and metal plate devices, as well as equipment for producing such cards.  The company served as exclusive marketing agent for PCSI's line of thermal printers, and also marketed a line of embossing machines for FIMA S.p.A. PCSI and FIMA USA shared the same premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1990, FIMA S.p.A. ordered Gay's termination as an officer and director of FIMA USA.  Gay remained, however, the president, a director, and the controlling shareholder of PCSI.  He became entitled to vote the majority of the PCSI shares until all debt owed by PCSI to him and all debt owed by Axline to PCSI was paid in full.  After his termination from FIMA USA, Gay went to the office only irregularly and, following a birthday party for him on October 29, he did not return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after the party, Gay initiated discussions with Axline about ending their PCSI relationship.  Axline originally offered to sell his PCSI shares to Gay for about $50,000, their approximate book value at the time as calculated by Gay with assistance from PCSI's accountant.  The company's assets consisted virtually entirely of 36 thermal printing machines.  It had no employees, and neither Gay nor Axline placed any value on possible projects that were in various stages of discussion.  In the course of negotiations, Gay and Axline changed buying/selling positions and, on about December 12, they agreed that Gay would receive a total of $50,000 consideration for his shares ($42,000 in book value and $8,000 in loan forgiveness).  A closing on this deal took place on December 20, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 30, 1990, an inactive FIMA USA distributor, Dave Campbell, had called the company asking for the use of a PCSI machine for a demonstration for a possible sale in Mexico.  In subsequent phone calls early in December, Campbell explained that a Kodak affiliate in Mexico was bidding on a project involving plastic voter identification cards.  At Campbell's request, Axline provided a letter detailing FIMA USA's financial condition and experience with ID cards.  FIMA USA sent Campbell a machine for the demonstration, and a technician who regularly worked as an independent contractor on PCSI machines also traveled to Mexico on December 9 to assist.  Campbell had offered to pay for this technical support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original indication from Campbell was that the Mexico project would involve the purchase of 17 or 18 machines.  The number increased to 48 by December 4, and eventually grew to 82.  Although Axline remained in contact with Campbell through December, he testified that he gave little consideration to the project because it seemed an unlikely prospect.  The specifications called for processes outside the capability of the PCSI machines, Kodak was competing with several other contractors for the job, and PCSI was competing as subcontractor with a large company (DataCard) whose technology was considered superior to its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of FIMA USA and PCSI's involvement with the Mexico project changed at the end of December, when Campbell dropped out as an intermediary and Axline began direct contact with Kodak.  On two occasions in early January, Axline and another FIMA USA officer, Peter Kline, met with Kodak officials in Rochester.  After the second meeting, which was held on January 10, FIMA USA informed its Austrian supplier of the possibility of a large sale.  A contract was signed between Kodak and the Mexican government on January 14, and defendants testified that they were informed on January 22 of the Mexican government's intent to order 82 PCSI machines.  The equipment was shipped between February and April.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay subsequently filed this securities action, alleging that the defendants' failure to tell him about the Mexican project before the stock closing violated various state and federal laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5.  He claims that, if defendants had disclosed the deal, he would have waited to sell his stock, and would have received substantially more for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants because an affidavit from a former PCSI employee, Sobieski, suggested that defendants deliberately withheld from Gay all information about the Mexican project.  In a footnote to its pretrial order, however, the court noted that, \"[a]s stated in Court on January 26, 1993 [the date of the unrecorded summary judgment hearing], the facts as stated in the defendant's motion for summary judgment are deemed admitted except as specifically controverted by the plaintiff.\"  In the court's view, all that remained to be resolved was the affiant's credibility, which would lead to a finding of who knew what, and when, regarding the Mexican project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a non-jury trial, the court found that the Mexican project was in such a preliminary stage at the time of the closing that it was not \"material\" information that defendants had an obligation to disclose under either Rule 10b-5 or state fiduciary duty standards.  The court found incredible Sobieski's testimony that defendants took measures to conceal the project from Gay.  It therefore granted judgment for defendants on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gay asserts that the district court's judgment suffers from both procedural and substantive defects.  First, he argues that the district court improperly considered affidavits and depositions that were submitted in connection with the summary judgment motion but were not admitted into evidence at trial.  Second, he contends that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes at the summary judgment hearing, and erred in excluding those issues from the trial.  Finally, Gay contests the district court's determination that defendants violated neither federal securities law nor state fiduciary duty standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that the district court mishandled this case in two ways.  In our view, these asserted problems, even if error, neither undermine the court's decision nor require extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Depositions and Affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated in its opinion that, in reaching its decision, it had considered depositions and \"the uncontroverted portions of affidavits\" that were submitted in support of defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Gay complains that these materials were not admitted into evidence at trial, that they constituted inadmissible hearsay, and that the court's reliance on them therefore was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay accepts, however, that an appellate court will not reverse a trial court in a non-jury case based on the admission of incompetent evidence unless it appears from the record that the court relied upon that evidence to make an essential finding that otherwise would not have been made.   See generally Hampton School Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976 F.2d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1992) (district court judgment will not be reversed for technical errors that do not affect substantial rights of the parties);   DaSilva v. American Brands, Inc., 845 F.2d 356, 363 (1st Cir. 1988) (retrial not required when erroneous findings are not prejudicial).  Gay identifies only a single deposition and a limited series of findings as problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pomerantz, the head of the Mexican project for Kodak, was deposed but did not testify at trial.  The district court's opinion included the following statements about FIMA USA's prospects early in January:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Pomerantz had not made any decision as to who would supply the machines if Kodak were awarded the contract.  Kodak was competing with at least two other prime contractors, and FIMA USA was competing with another subcontractor, DataCard Corporation, a very large competitor with technology considered more suitable for the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay contends that these were \"critical findings relating to the state of mind of Kodak and Pomerantz,\" that they evidently were drawn from Pomerantz' inadmissible deposition, and that they unfairly led the court to conclude that PCSI was unlikely to obtain the Kodak subcontract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the district court considered Pomerantz' deposition in making these findings is immaterial because testimony elicited at trial warranted the same inferences.  Axline testified that, at the time he and Kline traveled to Rochester on January 2, 1990, they knew that they were competing with DataCard.  He stated that he saw DataCard equipment at the Kodak facility, and was told by Kodak officials that they still were considering DataCard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kline also testified that the Rochester trip on January 2 was for the purpose of demonstrating that the PCSI machine could perform as well as DataCard's, which apparently was preferred at that time because it was believed to have better printing quality.  Because Pomerantz was the person with whom Axline and Kline dealt in Rochester, the court properly could find based on their testimony that Pomerantz had not yet decided which company would supply the machines if Kodak won the Mexican contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, regardless of the propriety of the court's reliance on summary judgment depositions and affidavits-and we make no ruling on that issue-no reversible error occurred.  The only findings that Gay identifies as crucial were otherwise proven through admissible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Disputed facts at summary judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, see supra at 5, the district court's pretrial order stated that all facts contained in defendants' motion for summary judgment and not specifically controverted would be deemed admitted.  The court, however, did not list any particular facts as already determined.  At the opening of trial, the court observed that the proceeding was being held \"to conclude the fact finding,\" and indicated that the remaining factual dispute concerned Sobieski's testimony;  specifically, was Sobieski telling the truth in charging that the defendants concealed the Mexico project from Gay knowing that it was a lucrative opportunity for PCSI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that, in confining the trial to Sobieski's credibility, the district court essentially found disputed facts on the motion for summary judgment, thus improperly denying him a full hearing on his claims.  He points to three issues that he believes were improperly found at the summary judgment stage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*DataCard remained in contention to supply the machines for the Mexican project until mid-January 1991;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*the project was unlikely for FIMA USA and PCSI because the specifications included processes outside the capability of the PCSI machines;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*pricing information was first submitted to Kodak's Mexico affiliate on January 16, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it unnecessary to explore the proper boundaries of the district court's authority to resolve these issues following the summary judgment hearing because any such findings were revisited fully at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and Gay was given ample opportunity to disprove them.  During the course of the two-day proceeding, the district court heard extensive testimony about all aspects of the Mexican deal from the principals of FIMA USA and PCSI, as well as from the plaintiff and his witnesses.  Each of the three points raised as crucial by Gay was addressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We already have noted evidence identifying DataCard as a competitor of PCSI's through at least the beginning of January.  See supra at 7-8.  Whether that status continued for another week or so is of no consequence, since the crucial point of reference is the December 20th closing.  As for the date pricing information was provided to Kodak, the district court heard ample testimony explaining that the pricing originally was done through the distributor Campbell and that FIMA USA first submitted a price list directly to Kodak on January 16th or 17th.  Axline's testimony at trial also permitted the district court to find that, regardless of the capability of the PCSI machines to meet the specifications of the Mexican project as they ultimately were defined, FIMA USA's principals initially felt the deal was beyond their range because PCSI's equipment could not accommodate the Mexican government's desire to include a photograph on the voter ID card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court allowed the parties wide scope in presenting evidence at trial notwithstanding its limited articulation of the issues that remained to be resolved.  We have no basis for concluding that the court made its factfinding prematurely on any significant issues.  Moreover, at no time following issuance of the amended pretrial order did Gay meaningfully seek reconsideration or clarification of the court's ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Certainly in these circumstances there was no reversible error in the court's procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Securities Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail with a claim under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, and associated Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must prove scienter, a material omission or misrepresentation by the defendant, reliance and due diligence.   See Milton v. Van Dorn Co., 961 F.2d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1992);   Holmes v. Batson, 583 F.2d 542, 551 (1st Cir. 1978).  The district court in this case reached only the material omission element.  It concluded that the information about the Mexican project known by the defendants at the time of Gay's December 20th stock closing was not material and that, consequently, their failure to disclose it was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay argues that the evidence unequivocally demonstrated that the information was material, and he attributes the court's erroneous conclusion at least in part to its mistaken view of certain critical facts.  We agree that the court's opinion reflects two relevant factual mistakes, see infra at 14, and we consequently have reviewed the record and the court's opinion with particular care.  We believe that neither error, nor both in combination, is sufficiently crucial to undermine the court's finding on materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard used in our circuit for determining whether undisclosed information is material follows the formulation set out by the Supreme Court in  TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976):  \"whether there is 'a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of a reasonable shareholder,' \" SEC v. McDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 49 (1st Cir. 1983).   See Milton, 961 F.2d at 969.  As we recently emphasized, not every piece of relevant information will be deemed material:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>The mere fact that an investor might find information interesting or desirable is not sufficient to satisfy the materiality requirement.  Rather, information is \"material\" only if its disclosure would alter the \"total mix\" of facts available to the investor and \"if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important\" to the investment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further have recognized that if an alleged omission involves \"speculative judgments about future events,\" id.  (emphasis omitted), materiality will depend upon \"a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity,\" id.  (emphasis in original).  See also McDonald, 699 F.2d at 50.  In other words, the fact that discussion has begun about a project with a potentially substantial impact on a company's stock price ordinarily would not be material if the likelihood of its happening were extremely remote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the defendants were not required to inform Gay about the Mexican project because, at the time of the closing, the deal was \"extremely uncertain and contingent in nature.\"  The court noted that both \"the anticipated magnitude of the sale and the probability that it would occur were both small as of December 20.\"  The court also deemed significant Gay's lack of interest in other pending PCSI projects of which he was aware.  It observed that Gay consciously placed no value on these business opportunities in the negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis suffers from two factual flaws.  First, its statement that the anticipated magnitude of the Mexican project as of December 20 was small does not square with the undisputed evidence that the number of machines needed had swelled to 48 by early December.  This number exceeded PCSI's inventory.  Because the inventory constituted virtually all of PCSI's assets, the Mexican project's potential impact on the company's value fairly could be described only as substantial once the deal encompassed all of the remaining machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in noting Gay's lack of interest in other ongoing PCSI business dealings, the court singled out a project for American Express.  In fact, PCSI was not involved in that project.  The American Express deal was the subject of testimony at trial because it was a significant opportunity for FIMA USA, but it would have had no effect on PCSI's value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, these errors are not fatal to the district court's materiality analysis, which rested much more heavily on the uncertain nature of the Mexican project than on its scope.  That the court erroneously described the project as small may chip the foundation of its analysis, but the weight of the probability finding prevents its collapse.  See infra at 16-17.  The mistaken reference to the American Express project likewise has limited impact.  The court cited Gay's failure to inquire about the progress of that deal as illustrative of his general attitude toward various ongoing business dealings involving PCSI.  Although Gay argues that the American Express project was unique because it was so developed and had great potential (and thus was more similar to the Mexican deal), the district court did not single out the American Express deal on that basis.  It described American Express as \"one of several other projects during the pre-closing period which were more advanced and more likely to bear fruit.\"  The finding for which the district court used the American Express project-that Gay valued his PCSI stock based solely on its equipment inventory-remains supported even without American Express.  See infra at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the court's errors do not require reversal of its judgment, we now turn to a more complete review of its determination that defendants did not violate section 10(b) in failing to disclose what they knew about the Mexican project before the December 20th closing.  Our review, of course, is only for clear error.  See Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., No. 93-1615, slip op. at 13-15 (1st Cir.  March 8, 1994) (findings in a bench trial are reviewed with \"considerable solicitude\");   Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea, 11 F.3d 1106, 1111 (1st Cir. 1993) (factual findings and mixed questions of fact and law both reviewed under clearly erroneous standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated above, the district court based its materiality ruling on two primary determinations-that the probability of the sale was small as of December 20th and that Gay had demonstrated a lack of interest in prospective PCSI projects.  Neither of these can be termed clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mexican project first came to PCSI's attention in the phone call from Campbell, the distributor, on November 30th.  By the time of the closing, three weeks later, the following events had occurred:  Michael Rochette, an independent contractor who worked on PCSI machines, had traveled to Mexico at Campbell's request and expense to participate, with other competitors, in a demonstration for the Mexican government;  also at Campbell's request, Axline had faxed a letter containing financial and other background information about FIMA USA to Mexico;  Axline had been in regular contact with Campbell, from both Campbell's home base in Canada and from Mexico, throughout December;  the number of machines at stake in the project had increased from an original estimate of 17 or 18 to at least 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that, during this period, Axline or any other defendant was given reason to believe that FIMA USA had more than a remote chance of obtaining the Mexican business.  The demonstration in which Rochette participated on about December 10th included three different Kodak proposals (only one involving PCSI machines) as well as efforts by two other companies.  Not only did Axline and others testify that they believed the PCSI machines could not perform the work, but there also was skepticism about Campbell's ability to land a deal in Mexico from his base in Canada.  See, e.g., Testimony of Frank Gubello, national service manager for FIMA USA, Tr. II, at 88-89 (\"It sounded kind of fishy to me....  [I]t just didn't sound like it was going to come off.\").  Axline testified that FIMA USA's activity in December simply was routine effort to support a dealer:  \"It was just another one of those things that come in on a regular basis which you work on....  We gave it very limited potential.  In fact, [we] didn't think much about it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing cited by the plaintiff, with the exception of Sobieski's affidavit and testimony, contradicts the defendants' assertion that the deal appeared to be no more than a long shot until early January, after Axline and Kline's visits to Rochester.  The district court found Sobieski's testimony to be \"inherently implausible,\" and we will not second-guess this credibility judgment.   See Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc., 11 F.3d at 1115 (\"It is established beyond cavil that the trial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses....\").   The district court's summary of the evidence on probability is therefore uncontradicted:  \"What little contact the defendants had with the project prior to December 20 was merely in the nature of an inquiry by a distributor and a demonstration of machines which had, as far as these defendants were concerned, very little chance of ripening into a sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that the court improperly ignored the imminence of the Mexican government's decision on a contractor, and argues that the court should have recognized that a reasonable investor would have held his stock pending the decision.  Although the advantage of hindsight gives this assertion some appeal, the court's supportable conclusion was that there was nothing of substance to wait for as of December 20th.  Had the closing been ten days later, after the direct contact between FIMA USA and Kodak, Gay's point would be more compelling, even with no other evidence of FIMA USA's chances of winning the subcontract.  At that stage, unlike on December 20th, there was a basis for viewing FIMA USA and PCSI's relationship with the project as more than just a distributor's inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's assessment of materiality also was informed by evidence demonstrating Gay's lack of interest in other pending PCSI projects.  Although he remained president of PCSI until he sold his stock, Gay stopped coming to the office after October 29 because he felt uncomfortable being in an office where everyone else was employed by FIMA USA.  At no time did he ask the status of any of the \"development ideas and projects\" in which he knew PCSI had a hand at the time he and Axline began to discuss a stock buyout, including a project with the United States Post Office that had resulted in the sale of a machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay maintains that none of these other possibilities was as significant in size or as imminent as the Mexican project, and he insists that his lack of interest in them is therefore irrelevant in determining the materiality of the Kodak deal.  In so arguing, however, Gay presumes that the Mexican project was so developed before December 20th that it obviously was distinguishable from PCSI's other opportunities.  The district court, in rejecting Sobieski's testimony and crediting defendants', found to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the evidence indicating that Campbell's bid on behalf of PCSI was a long-shot, together with Gay's explicit testimony that he was uninterested in \"incipient business ideas,\" supports the district court's finding that disclosure of what defendants knew about the Mexican project as of December 20th would not have \"alter[ed] the 'total mix' of facts available to the investor,\"  Milton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).  This is enough to foreclose us from finding that the court clearly erred.  We therefore affirm its judgment on the 10(b) claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Fiduciary Duty Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay argues that, even if the district court properly found that defendants were not required to disclose the Mexican project under Rule 10b-5, they still may be found responsible for violating state fiduciary duty standards.  He contends that the burden of disclosure for fiduciaries under Massachusetts law is greater than that imposed by federal securities law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay relies heavily on  Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, 367 Mass. 578, 328 N.E.2d 505 (1975), in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court quoted language from an opinion by Justice Cardozo describing the standard of behavior among partners in a joint venture as \"[n]ot honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.\"  367 Mass. at 594.  See  also Wartski v. Bedford, 926 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Donahue ).  Gay maintains that, under the \"punctilio of honor\" standard, whatever information defendants had about the Mexican project should have been disclosed in advance of the stock closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree.  The basic fiduciary requirement under Massachusetts law is that business partners and stockholders in close corporations refrain from acting out of \"avarice, expediency or self-interest in derogation of their duty of loyalty to the other stockholders and to the corporation,\"  Donahue, 367 Mass. at 593;  328 N.E.2d at 515.  In quoting Cardozo's language, the SJC in Donahue simply was restating this strict good faith standard and distinguishing it from what the SJC viewed as the lesser standard of \"good faith and inherent fairness\" to which directors and stockholders must adhere in the normal discharge of their responsibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see nothing to be gained from discussing, as a categorical matter, whether the Massachusetts fiduciary duty standard requires greater disclosure than Rule 10b-5.   But see Sugarman v. Sugarman, 797 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Majority shareholders ... must fully disclose all the material facts and circumstances surrounding or affecting a proposed transaction.\")  (emphasis added);  Pavlidis v.  New England Patriots Football Club, 675 F. Supp. 696, 698 (D. Mass. 1987) (\"The fiduciary duty imposed on a majority shareholder under Massachusetts law is to disclose material information.\")  (citing Sugarman ).  It suffices to say that, in this case, the district court did not err in rejecting Gay's fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record fails to demonstrate that defendants took actions to benefit themselves without regard for, or in spite of, their obligation of loyalty to Gay.  The court permissibly found that it did not occur to them to discuss the Mexico project simply because of their good faith belief that the project was not a realistic opportunity for PCSI.  It further found that Gay was not in a disadvantaged position vis-a-vis the defendants because, as president and majority shareholder of PCSI, he had \"every opportunity to look after his own interests.\"  Defendants had neither superior business knowledge nor more substantial experience than Gay, a well educated businessman who was advised throughout the negotiations process by a lawyer and accountant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Gay has failed to prove a violation of the standard of \"utmost good faith and loyalty,\"  Donahue, 367 Mass. at 593.  We consequently find no error in the district court's ruling on the fiduciary duty claim, and for similar reasons, endorse the judgment for defendants on Gay's claim under Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These machines are used for printing on plastic cards</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sobieski testified that he had been instructed not to tell Gay anything about the Mexican project because \"there was [a] lot of money for all to be made in this deal ... [a]nd he no longer was a part of the company.\"  He also claimed to have been told to take various security measures to limit Gay's access to the PCSI office and warehouse space, such as fixing window blinds so that Gay could not see in and keeping certain doors locked \"in case of an unannounced visit.\"  Sobieski was fired from PCSI in 1991 because of insubordination and poor job performance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Indeed, it is not clear that the court actually viewed the facts contested by Gay as having been found before trial.

That was undisputed.\"  He went on:</p>\n        <p>The question now is what happened in November and December of 1990, what was concealed from Mr. Gay by Axline and others, and what they said to Mr. Sobieski about his role.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Gay has not identified any testimony or other evidence on these issues that he was barred from presenting as a result of the district court's pretrial order.  Indeed, at the opening of the trial, Gay's attorney noted his view that, despite the pretrial order, he viewed the major issues as controverted and therefore sought to introduce all of his proposed 25 exhibits into evidence.  The court allowed all the exhibits, reserving ruling on their credibility, relevance and weight</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At the end of his pretrial memorandum, following the list of exhibits to be introduced at trial, Gay noted that the document was filed in accordance with footnote two of the district court's amended pretrial order.  He then stated:  \"Plaintiff objects to the ruling in said footnote and reserves his rights with respect thereto.\"  A similar statement was made in another memorandum filed with the court before trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Gay cites language from SEC. v. McDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1983), to the effect that \"[a] 'reasonable, if speculative, investor' would consider information indicating even the possible occurrence of an event of magnitude to be important.\"  This statement did not mean that a major event would be deemed material within the meaning of Rule 10b-5 even if wholly improbable.  In McDonald, the probability was strong that the relevant event would take place, see id. at 49, and the court's finding was that \"the future event was sufficiently large to remain material even discounting for whatever uncertainty may be thought to have existed.\"   Id. at 50</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In fact, the full Cardozo quotation in Donahue more clearly reflects the distinction being made between simple \"honesty\" and fiduciary duty:</p>\n        <p>Joint adventurers, like copartners, owe to one another, while the enterprise continues, the duty of the finest loyalty.  Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary duties....

In this securities action, he alleges that the defendants intentionally failed to disclose a substantial business prospect for PCSI, causing him to sell his stock for substantially less than its real value.  The district court, following a bench trial, found no violation of law.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paul Gay founded PCSI in 1987 and initially was its sole shareholder, director and officer.  Defendant Robert Axline joined the company, which distributes thermal printing machines for an Austrian manufacturer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> as a fifty percent shareholder and chief executive officer the next year.  When the other defendants became shareholders in 1990, Gay and Axline each retained 38.5 percent ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1988, PCSI collaborated with FIMA S.p.A., an Italian company, to form FIMA USA, Inc.  (FIMA USA).  Gay and Axline each owned 20 percent of FIMA USA, and FIMA S.p.A. owned 60 percent.  Axline became president of FIMA USA and Gay became executive vice president.  FIMA USA distributed plastic cards, personalization equipment for credit cards, and other plastic card and metal plate devices, as well as equipment for producing such cards.  The company served as exclusive marketing agent for PCSI's line of thermal printers, and also marketed a line of embossing machines for FIMA S.p.A. PCSI and FIMA USA shared the same premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1990, FIMA S.p.A. ordered Gay's termination as an officer and director of FIMA USA.  Gay remained, however, the president, a director, and the controlling shareholder of PCSI.  He became entitled to vote the majority of the PCSI shares until all debt owed by PCSI to him and all debt owed by Axline to PCSI was paid in full.  After his termination from FIMA USA, Gay went to the office only irregularly and, following a birthday party for him on October 29, he did not return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after the party, Gay initiated discussions with Axline about ending their PCSI relationship.  Axline originally offered to sell his PCSI shares to Gay for about $50,000, their approximate book value at the time as calculated by Gay with assistance from PCSI's accountant.  The company's assets consisted virtually entirely of 36 thermal printing machines.  It had no employees, and neither Gay nor Axline placed any value on possible projects that were in various stages of discussion.  In the course of negotiations, Gay and Axline changed buying/selling positions and, on about December 12, they agreed that Gay would receive a total of $50,000 consideration for his shares ($42,000 in book value and $8,000 in loan forgiveness).  A closing on this deal took place on December 20, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 30, 1990, an inactive FIMA USA distributor, Dave Campbell, had called the company asking for the use of a PCSI machine for a demonstration for a possible sale in Mexico.  In subsequent phone calls early in December, Campbell explained that a Kodak affiliate in Mexico was bidding on a project involving plastic voter identification cards.  At Campbell's request, Axline provided a letter detailing FIMA USA's financial condition and experience with ID cards.  FIMA USA sent Campbell a machine for the demonstration, and a technician who regularly worked as an independent contractor on PCSI machines also traveled to Mexico on December 9 to assist.  Campbell had offered to pay for this technical support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original indication from Campbell was that the Mexico project would involve the purchase of 17 or 18 machines.  The number increased to 48 by December 4, and eventually grew to 82.  Although Axline remained in contact with Campbell through December, he testified that he gave little consideration to the project because it seemed an unlikely prospect.  The specifications called for processes outside the capability of the PCSI machines, Kodak was competing with several other contractors for the job, and PCSI was competing as subcontractor with a large company (DataCard) whose technology was considered superior to its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of FIMA USA and PCSI's involvement with the Mexico project changed at the end of December, when Campbell dropped out as an intermediary and Axline began direct contact with Kodak.  On two occasions in early January, Axline and another FIMA USA officer, Peter Kline, met with Kodak officials in Rochester.  After the second meeting, which was held on January 10, FIMA USA informed its Austrian supplier of the possibility of a large sale.  A contract was signed between Kodak and the Mexican government on January 14, and defendants testified that they were informed on January 22 of the Mexican government's intent to order 82 PCSI machines.  The equipment was shipped between February and April.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay subsequently filed this securities action, alleging that the defendants' failure to tell him about the Mexican project before the stock closing violated various state and federal laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5.  He claims that, if defendants had disclosed the deal, he would have waited to sell his stock, and would have received substantially more for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants because an affidavit from a former PCSI employee, Sobieski, suggested that defendants deliberately withheld from Gay all information about the Mexican project.  In a footnote to its pretrial order, however, the court noted that, \"[a]s stated in Court on January 26, 1993 [the date of the unrecorded summary judgment hearing], the facts as stated in the defendant's motion for summary judgment are deemed admitted except as specifically controverted by the plaintiff.\"  In the court's view, all that remained to be resolved was the affiant's credibility, which would lead to a finding of who knew what, and when, regarding the Mexican project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a non-jury trial, the court found that the Mexican project was in such a preliminary stage at the time of the closing that it was not \"material\" information that defendants had an obligation to disclose under either Rule 10b-5 or state fiduciary duty standards.  The court found incredible Sobieski's testimony that defendants took measures to conceal the project from Gay.  It therefore granted judgment for defendants on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gay asserts that the district court's judgment suffers from both procedural and substantive defects.  First, he argues that the district court improperly considered affidavits and depositions that were submitted in connection with the summary judgment motion but were not admitted into evidence at trial.  Second, he contends that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes at the summary judgment hearing, and erred in excluding those issues from the trial.  Finally, Gay contests the district court's determination that defendants violated neither federal securities law nor state fiduciary duty standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that the district court mishandled this case in two ways.  In our view, these asserted problems, even if error, neither undermine the court's decision nor require extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Depositions and Affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated in its opinion that, in reaching its decision, it had considered depositions and \"the uncontroverted portions of affidavits\" that were submitted in support of defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Gay complains that these materials were not admitted into evidence at trial, that they constituted inadmissible hearsay, and that the court's reliance on them therefore was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay accepts, however, that an appellate court will not reverse a trial court in a non-jury case based on the admission of incompetent evidence unless it appears from the record that the court relied upon that evidence to make an essential finding that otherwise would not have been made.   See generally Hampton School Dist. v. Dobrowolski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591386\"><a href=\"/opinion/591386/hampton-school-district-v-charles-dobrowolski/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1992) (district court judgment will not be reversed for technical errors that do not affect substantial rights of the parties);   DaSilva v.

Gay identifies only a single deposition and a limited series of findings as problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pomerantz, the head of the Mexican project for Kodak, was deposed but did not testify at trial.  The district court's opinion included the following statements about FIMA USA's prospects early in January:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Pomerantz had not made any decision as to who would supply the machines if Kodak were awarded the contract.  Kodak was competing with at least two other prime contractors, and FIMA USA was competing with another subcontractor, DataCard Corporation, a very large competitor with technology considered more suitable for the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay contends that these were \"critical findings relating to the state of mind of Kodak and Pomerantz,\" that they evidently were drawn from Pomerantz' inadmissible deposition, and that they unfairly led the court to conclude that PCSI was unlikely to obtain the Kodak subcontract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the district court considered Pomerantz' deposition in making these findings is immaterial because testimony elicited at trial warranted the same inferences.  Axline testified that, at the time he and Kline traveled to Rochester on January 2, 1990, they knew that they were competing with DataCard.  He stated that he saw DataCard equipment at the Kodak facility, and was told by Kodak officials that they still were considering DataCard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kline also testified that the Rochester trip on January 2 was for the purpose of demonstrating that the PCSI machine could perform as well as DataCard's, which apparently was preferred at that time because it was believed to have better printing quality.  Because Pomerantz was the person with whom Axline and Kline dealt in Rochester, the court properly could find based on their testimony that Pomerantz had not yet decided which company would supply the machines if Kodak won the Mexican contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, regardless of the propriety of the court's reliance on summary judgment depositions and affidavits-and we make no ruling on that issue-no reversible error occurred.  The only findings that Gay identifies as crucial were otherwise proven through admissible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Disputed facts at summary judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, see supra at 5, the district court's pretrial order stated that all facts contained in defendants' motion for summary judgment and not specifically controverted would be deemed admitted.  The court, however, did not list any particular facts as already determined.  At the opening of trial, the court observed that the proceeding was being held \"to conclude the fact finding,\" and indicated that the remaining factual dispute concerned Sobieski's testimony;  specifically, was Sobieski telling the truth in charging that the defendants concealed the Mexico project from Gay knowing that it was a lucrative opportunity for PCSI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that, in confining the trial to Sobieski's credibility, the district court essentially found disputed facts on the motion for summary judgment, thus improperly denying him a full hearing on his claims.  He points to three issues that he believes were improperly found at the summary judgment stage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*DataCard remained in contention to supply the machines for the Mexican project until mid-January 1991;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*the project was unlikely for FIMA USA and PCSI because the specifications included processes outside the capability of the PCSI machines;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*pricing information was first submitted to Kodak's Mexico affiliate on January 16, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it unnecessary to explore the proper boundaries of the district court's authority to resolve these issues following the summary judgment hearing because any such findings were revisited fully at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and Gay was given ample opportunity to disprove them.  During the course of the two-day proceeding, the district court heard extensive testimony about all aspects of the Mexican deal from the principals of FIMA USA and PCSI, as well as from the plaintiff and his witnesses.  Each of the three points raised as crucial by Gay was addressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We already have noted evidence identifying DataCard as a competitor of PCSI's through at least the beginning of January.  See supra at 7-8.  Whether that status continued for another week or so is of no consequence, since the crucial point of reference is the December 20th closing.  As for the date pricing information was provided to Kodak, the district court heard ample testimony explaining that the pricing originally was done through the distributor Campbell and that FIMA USA first submitted a price list directly to Kodak on January 16th or 17th.  Axline's testimony at trial also permitted the district court to find that, regardless of the capability of the PCSI machines to meet the specifications of the Mexican project as they ultimately were defined, FIMA USA's principals initially felt the deal was beyond their range because PCSI's equipment could not accommodate the Mexican government's desire to include a photograph on the voter ID card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court allowed the parties wide scope in presenting evidence at trial notwithstanding its limited articulation of the issues that remained to be resolved.  We have no basis for concluding that the court made its factfinding prematurely on any significant issues.  Moreover, at no time following issuance of the amended pretrial order did Gay meaningfully seek reconsideration or clarification of the court's ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Certainly in these circumstances there was no reversible error in the court's procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Securities Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail with a claim under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, and associated Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must prove scienter, a material omission or misrepresentation by the defendant, reliance and due diligence.   See Milton v. Van Dorn Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581509\"><a href=\"/opinion/581509/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96601-james-w-milton-v-van-dorn-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 969 (1st Cir. 1992);   Holmes v.

The district court in this case reached only the material omission element.  It concluded that the information about the Mexican project known by the defendants at the time of Gay's December 20th stock closing was not material and that, consequently, their failure to disclose it was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay argues that the evidence unequivocally demonstrated that the information was material, and he attributes the court's erroneous conclusion at least in part to its mistaken view of certain critical facts.  We agree that the court's opinion reflects two relevant factual mistakes, see infra at 14, and we consequently have reviewed the record and the court's opinion with particular care.  We believe that neither error, nor both in combination, is sufficiently crucial to undermine the court's finding on materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard used in our circuit for determining whether undisclosed information is material follows the formulation set out by the Supreme Court in  TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109481\"><a href=\"/opinion/109481/tsc-industries-inc-v-northway-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 449 (1976):  \"whether there is 'a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of a reasonable shareholder,' \" SEC v.

See Milton, 961 F.2d at 969.  As we recently emphasized, not every piece of relevant information will be deemed material:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>The mere fact that an investor might find information interesting or desirable is not sufficient to satisfy the materiality requirement.  Rather, information is \"material\" only if its disclosure would alter the \"total mix\" of facts available to the investor and \"if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important\" to the investment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further have recognized that if an alleged omission involves \"speculative judgments about future events,\" id.  (emphasis omitted), materiality will depend upon \"a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity,\" id.  (emphasis in original).  See also McDonald, 699 F.2d at 50.  In other words, the fact that discussion has begun about a project with a potentially substantial impact on a company's stock price ordinarily would not be material if the likelihood of its happening were extremely remote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the defendants were not required to inform Gay about the Mexican project because, at the time of the closing, the deal was \"extremely uncertain and contingent in nature.\"  The court noted that both \"the anticipated magnitude of the sale and the probability that it would occur were both small as of December 20.\"  The court also deemed significant Gay's lack of interest in other pending PCSI projects of which he was aware.  It observed that Gay consciously placed no value on these business opportunities in the negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis suffers from two factual flaws.  First, its statement that the anticipated magnitude of the Mexican project as of December 20 was small does not square with the undisputed evidence that the number of machines needed had swelled to 48 by early December.  This number exceeded PCSI's inventory.  Because the inventory constituted virtually all of PCSI's assets, the Mexican project's potential impact on the company's value fairly could be described only as substantial once the deal encompassed all of the remaining machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in noting Gay's lack of interest in other ongoing PCSI business dealings, the court singled out a project for American Express.  In fact, PCSI was not involved in that project.  The American Express deal was the subject of testimony at trial because it was a significant opportunity for FIMA USA, but it would have had no effect on PCSI's value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, these errors are not fatal to the district court's materiality analysis, which rested much more heavily on the uncertain nature of the Mexican project than on its scope.  That the court erroneously described the project as small may chip the foundation of its analysis, but the weight of the probability finding prevents its collapse.  See infra at 16-17.  The mistaken reference to the American Express project likewise has limited impact.  The court cited Gay's failure to inquire about the progress of that deal as illustrative of his general attitude toward various ongoing business dealings involving PCSI.  Although Gay argues that the American Express project was unique because it was so developed and had great potential (and thus was more similar to the Mexican deal), the district court did not single out the American Express deal on that basis.  It described American Express as \"one of several other projects during the pre-closing period which were more advanced and more likely to bear fruit.\"  The finding for which the district court used the American Express project-that Gay valued his PCSI stock based solely on its equipment inventory-remains supported even without American Express.  See infra at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the court's errors do not require reversal of its judgment, we now turn to a more complete review of its determination that defendants did not violate section 10(b) in failing to disclose what they knew about the Mexican project before the December 20th closing.  Our review, of course, is only for clear error.  See Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., No. 93-1615, slip op. at 13-15 (1st Cir.  March 8, 1994) (findings in a bench trial are reviewed with \"considerable solicitude\");   Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658777\"><a href=\"/opinion/658777/gamma-audio-video-inc-v-ean-chea-dba-overseas-video/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span>, 1111 (1st Cir. 1993) (factual findings and mixed questions of fact and law both reviewed under clearly erroneous standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated above, the district court based its materiality ruling on two primary determinations-that the probability of the sale was small as of December 20th and that Gay had demonstrated a lack of interest in prospective PCSI projects.  Neither of these can be termed clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mexican project first came to PCSI's attention in the phone call from Campbell, the distributor, on November 30th.  By the time of the closing, three weeks later, the following events had occurred:  Michael Rochette, an independent contractor who worked on PCSI machines, had traveled to Mexico at Campbell's request and expense to participate, with other competitors, in a demonstration for the Mexican government;  also at Campbell's request, Axline had faxed a letter containing financial and other background information about FIMA USA to Mexico;  Axline had been in regular contact with Campbell, from both Campbell's home base in Canada and from Mexico, throughout December;  the number of machines at stake in the project had increased from an original estimate of 17 or 18 to at least 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that, during this period, Axline or any other defendant was given reason to believe that FIMA USA had more than a remote chance of obtaining the Mexican business.  The demonstration in which Rochette participated on about December 10th included three different Kodak proposals (only one involving PCSI machines) as well as efforts by two other companies.  Not only did Axline and others testify that they believed the PCSI machines could not perform the work, but there also was skepticism about Campbell's ability to land a deal in Mexico from his base in Canada.  See, e.g., Testimony of Frank Gubello, national service manager for FIMA USA, Tr. II, at 88-89 (\"It sounded kind of fishy to me....  [I]t just didn't sound like it was going to come off.\").  Axline testified that FIMA USA's activity in December simply was routine effort to support a dealer:  \"It was just another one of those things that come in on a regular basis which you work on....  We gave it very limited potential.  In fact, [we] didn't think much about it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing cited by the plaintiff, with the exception of Sobieski's affidavit and testimony, contradicts the defendants' assertion that the deal appeared to be no more than a long shot until early January, after Axline and Kline's visits to Rochester.  The district court found Sobieski's testimony to be \"inherently implausible,\" and we will not second-guess this credibility judgment.   See Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc., 11 F.3d at 1115 (\"It is established beyond cavil that the trial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses....\").   The district court's summary of the evidence on probability is therefore uncontradicted:  \"What little contact the defendants had with the project prior to December 20 was merely in the nature of an inquiry by a distributor and a demonstration of machines which had, as far as these defendants were concerned, very little chance of ripening into a sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay claims that the court improperly ignored the imminence of the Mexican government's decision on a contractor, and argues that the court should have recognized that a reasonable investor would have held his stock pending the decision.  Although the advantage of hindsight gives this assertion some appeal, the court's supportable conclusion was that there was nothing of substance to wait for as of December 20th.  Had the closing been ten days later, after the direct contact between FIMA USA and Kodak, Gay's point would be more compelling, even with no other evidence of FIMA USA's chances of winning the subcontract.  At that stage, unlike on December 20th, there was a basis for viewing FIMA USA and PCSI's relationship with the project as more than just a distributor's inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's assessment of materiality also was informed by evidence demonstrating Gay's lack of interest in other pending PCSI projects.  Although he remained president of PCSI until he sold his stock, Gay stopped coming to the office after October 29 because he felt uncomfortable being in an office where everyone else was employed by FIMA USA.  At no time did he ask the status of any of the \"development ideas and projects\" in which he knew PCSI had a hand at the time he and Axline began to discuss a stock buyout, including a project with the United States Post Office that had resulted in the sale of a machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay maintains that none of these other possibilities was as significant in size or as imminent as the Mexican project, and he insists that his lack of interest in them is therefore irrelevant in determining the materiality of the Kodak deal.  In so arguing, however, Gay presumes that the Mexican project was so developed before December 20th that it obviously was distinguishable from PCSI's other opportunities.  The district court, in rejecting Sobieski's testimony and crediting defendants', found to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the evidence indicating that Campbell's bid on behalf of PCSI was a long-shot, together with Gay's explicit testimony that he was uninterested in \"incipient business ideas,\" supports the district court's finding that disclosure of what defendants knew about the Mexican project as of December 20th would not have \"alter[ed] the 'total mix' of facts available to the investor,\"  Milton, 961 F.2d at 969 (emphasis omitted).  This is enough to foreclose us from finding that the court clearly erred.  We therefore affirm its judgment on the 10(b) claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Fiduciary Duty Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay argues that, even if the district court properly found that defendants were not required to disclose the Mexican project under Rule 10b-5, they still may be found responsible for violating state fiduciary duty standards.  He contends that the burden of disclosure for fiduciaries under Massachusetts law is greater than that imposed by federal securities law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gay relies heavily on  Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059671\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059671/donahue-v-rodd-electrotype-co-of-new-england-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059671\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059671/donahue-v-rodd-electrotype-co-of-new-england-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span> (1975), in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court quoted language from an opinion by Justice Cardozo describing the standard of behavior among partners in a joint venture as \"[n]ot honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.\"  367 Mass. at 594.

Gay maintains that, under the \"punctilio of honor\" standard, whatever information defendants had about the Mexican project should have been disclosed in advance of the stock closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree.  The basic fiduciary requirement under Massachusetts law is that business partners and stockholders in close corporations refrain from acting out of \"avarice, expediency or self-interest in derogation of their duty of loyalty to the other stockholders and to the corporation,\"  Donahue, 367 Mass. at 593;  328 N.E.2d at 515.  In quoting Cardozo's language, the SJC in Donahue simply was restating this strict good faith standard and distinguishing it from what the SJC viewed as the lesser standard of \"good faith and inherent fairness\" to which directors and stockholders must adhere in the normal discharge of their responsibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see nothing to be gained from discussing, as a categorical matter, whether the Massachusetts fiduciary duty standard requires greater disclosure than Rule 10b-5.   But see Sugarman v. Sugarman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474183\"><a href=\"/opinion/474183/jon-sugarman-v-leonard-sugarman-and-statler-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Majority shareholders ... must fully disclose all the material facts and circumstances surrounding or affecting a proposed transaction.\")  (emphasis added);  Pavlidis v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 698 (D. Mass. 1987) (\"The fiduciary duty imposed on a majority shareholder under Massachusetts law is to disclose material information.\")  (citing Sugarman ).  It suffices to say that, in this case, the district court did not err in rejecting Gay's fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record fails to demonstrate that defendants took actions to benefit themselves without regard for, or in spite of, their obligation of loyalty to Gay.  The court permissibly found that it did not occur to them to discuss the Mexico project simply because of their good faith belief that the project was not a realistic opportunity for PCSI.  It further found that Gay was not in a disadvantaged position vis-a-vis the defendants because, as president and majority shareholder of PCSI, he had \"every opportunity to look after his own interests.\"  Defendants had neither superior business knowledge nor more substantial experience than Gay, a well educated businessman who was advised throughout the negotiations process by a lawyer and accountant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Gay has failed to prove a violation of the standard of \"utmost good faith and loyalty,\"  Donahue, 367 Mass. at 593.  We consequently find no error in the district court's ruling on the fiduciary duty claim, and for similar reasons, endorse the judgment for defendants on Gay's claim under Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These machines are used for printing on plastic cards</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sobieski testified that he had been instructed not to tell Gay anything about the Mexican project because \"there was [a] lot of money for all to be made in this deal ...

Indeed, at the opening of the trial, Gay's attorney noted his view that, despite the pretrial order, he viewed the major issues as controverted and therefore sought to introduce all of his proposed 25 exhibits into evidence.  The court allowed all the exhibits, reserving ruling on their credibility, relevance and weight</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At the end of his pretrial memorandum, following the list of exhibits to be introduced at trial, Gay noted that the document was filed in accordance with footnote two of the district court's amended pretrial order.  He then stated:  \"Plaintiff objects to the ruling in said footnote and reserves his rights with respect thereto.\"  A similar statement was made in another memorandum filed with the court before trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Gay cites language from SEC. v.

In McDonald, the probability was strong that the relevant event would take place, see id. at 49, and the court's finding was that \"the future event was sufficiently large to remain material even discounting for whatever uncertainty may be thought to have existed.\"   Id. at 50</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In fact, the full Cardozo quotation in Donahue more clearly reflects the distinction being made between simple \"honesty\" and fiduciary duty:</p>\n        <p>Joint adventurers, like copartners, owe to one another, while the enterprise continues, the duty of the finest loyalty.  Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary duties....
