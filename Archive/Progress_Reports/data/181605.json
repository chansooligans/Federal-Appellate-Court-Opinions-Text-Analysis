Pat Godin, the former principal of\n\nthe Fort O'Brien Elementary School in Machiasport, Maine, brought\n\nsuit against the Machiasport School Department Board of Directors\n\n(\"Machiasport\") and School Union No. 134 in March 2009, alleging a\n\nviolation of her due process rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                   She\n\nalso    sued    three    individual   school     system   employees    who    had\n\nseparately stated in meetings with officials their views that Godin\n\nhad acted abusively toward students at the school.                    Plaintiff\n\nbrought state-law claims that these allegations were defamatory and\n\nled the school system to terminate her employment; the school\n\nsystem says her job was terminated due to budgetary shortfalls.\n\n               Many states have enacted special statutory protections\n\nfor individuals, like the individual school system employees in\n\nthis case, named as defendants as a result of the exercise of their\n\nconstitutional rights to petition the government.                  These anti-\n\n\"SLAPP\" (\"strategic litigation against public participation\") laws\n\nprovide such defendants with procedural and substantive defenses\n\nmeant    to    prevent    meritless   suits      from   imposing   significant\n\nlitigation costs and chilling protected speech.              The two federal\n\nappellate courts that have addressed whether they must enforce\n\nthese   state     anti-SLAPP   statutes     in    federal   proceedings      have\n\nconcluded that they must.         See Henry v. Lake Charles Am. Press,\n\nLLC, 566 F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2009); United States ex rel. Newsham v.\n\nLockheed Missiles & Space Co., 190 F.3d 963 (9th Cir. 1999). See\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\falso Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick, 264 F.3d 832, 845-47 (9th\n\nCir. 2001) (limiting application of one anti-SLAPP provision where\n\ninformation was within exclusive control of the defendant).           This\n\nquestion, here as it applies to Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, is one\n\nof first impression for this court, and lies at the center of this\n\nappeal.    We hold the Maine anti-SLAPP statute must be applied.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Basic background facts set the stage.           Shortly after\n\nGodin began working as a teacher and principal at the Fort O'Brien\n\nElementary School in August 2006, Machiasport began receiving\n\ncomplaints from other employees concerning her conduct toward\n\nstudents,     including   complaints     from   the   three    individual\n\ndefendants,    Patty   Schencks,   Joleen   Nicely,   and   Donna   Metta.1\n\nMachiasport conducted an investigation of Godin's conduct in May\n\n2008.     The June 4, 2008 investigation report concluded that the\n\nallegations that Godin's conduct was abusive and inappropriate were\n\nnot supported.\n\n            Two days after the report was issued, Godin received\n\nnotice from the Superintendent of Machiasport Schools that her\n\n\n     1\n          Nicely offered statements to both the Superintendent of\nSchools and the School Board that she felt Godin's treatment of an\neight-year-old child, which Nicely observed first hand, was\n\"inappropriate and abusive.\"       Schencks reported to Maine's\nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Maine State Police\nher observation of Godin's December 2007 treatment of a four-year-\nold child. Metta informed the Machiasport School Board that, on\ntwo occasions in January 2007, she observed Godin treat a student\nin a manner that in her view was abusive.\n\n                                   -3-\n\femployment contract, which would have expired in 2011, was being\n\nterminated due to budgetary constraints caused by \"significant\n\nsubsidy loss.\"   Godin was told that her position would be filled by\n\na \"teaching principal,\" which occurred on August 12, 2008.\n\n           On March 2, 2009, Godin brought suit in federal court,\n\nasserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Union\n\nand Machiasport, and a number of state claims, including claims\n\nagainst    the   individual   defendants   for   interference   with\n\nadvantageous contractual relationships and defamation.2\n\n           The individual defendants filed a special motion to\n\ndismiss under Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, which creates a special\n\nprocess by which a defendant may move to dismiss any claim that\n\narises from the defendant's exercise of the right of petition under\n\neither the United States Constitution or the Constitution of\n\nMaine.3   Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, § 556 (\"Section 556\").   Godin does\n\nnot dispute that her claims against the individual defendants are\n\n\n\n     2\n          Godin's other state claims include a breach of contract\nclaim against the Union and Machiasport and a claim for punitive\ndamages against all defendants.\n     3\n          The federal Constitution provides: \"Congress shall make\nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or\nthe right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. Const. amend. I.\n          The Maine Constitution provides: \"The people have a right\nat all times in an orderly and peaceable manner to assemble to\nconsult upon the common good, to give instructions to their\nrepresentatives, and to request, of either department of the\ngovernment by petition or remonstrance, redress of their wrongs and\ngrievances.\" Me. Const. art. 1, § 15.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fbased on conduct that falls within the statute's broad definition\n\nof \"a party's exercise of its right of petition.\"            Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 14, § 556.\n\n           The statute provides that once a defendant brings such a\n\n\"special motion to dismiss\" and demonstrates that the claims in\n\nquestion are based on the defendant's petitioning activity, the\n\ncourt \"shall advance [the motion] so that it may be heard and\n\ndetermined with as little delay as possible.\"          Id.   The court shall\n\ngrant the special motion \"unless the party against whom the special\n\nmotion is made shows that the moving party's exercise of its right\n\nof petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any\n\narguable basis in law and that the moving party's acts caused\n\nactual injury to the responding party.\"        Id.   In assessing whether\n\nto grant the special motion, \"the court shall consider the pleading\n\nand supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which\n\nthe liability or defense is based.\"            Id.     A court may order\n\ndiscovery specific to the Section 556 motion for good cause shown.\n\nId.   Evidence considered in reviewing a special motion to dismiss\n\nshould be viewed \"in the light most favorable to the moving party\n\nbecause the responding party bears the burden of proof when the\n\nstatute applies.\"    Morse Bros., Inc. v. Webster, 772 A.2d 842, 849\n\n(Me. 2001).\n\n           The district court denied the individual defendants'\n\nspecial   motion   under   Section    556,   holding    that   Section   556\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconflicts with Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 and 56 and so does not apply in\n\nfederal court.\n\n            This   interlocutory      appeal    raises   issues     of   first\n\nimpression within this circuit, namely: (1) whether, under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine, this court has appellate jurisdiction\n\nover an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a special motion\n\nto dismiss brought under Section 556 on the basis that Section 556\n\ncannot be reconciled with federal procedure; and (2) whether\n\nSection 556 applies in federal court proceedings.             We hold on the\n\nfacts   here   that   we   have   appellate    jurisdiction   and   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in not applying Maine's anti-SLAPP statute,\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, § 556.        We reverse and remand for further\n\nproceedings, including proceedings under Section 556.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We address two preliminary jurisdictional issues: (1)\n\nwhether federal subject-matter jurisdiction exists over the state-\n\nlaw claims against the non-diverse individual defendants even\n\nthough no federal claim has been brought against them, and (2)\n\nwhether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the individual\n\ndefendants' interlocutory appeal by virtue of the collateral order\n\ndoctrine.\n\nA.          Federal Subject-Matter Jurisdiction: The Supplemental\n            Jurisdiction Doctrine\n\n            Although the parties have not questioned subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over the claims at issue, \"a court has an obligation\n\n                                     -6-\n\fto inquire sua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction, and to\n\nproceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.\"            In re\n\nRecticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1002 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          In   her   complaint,   Godin   asserts   federal   question\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 et seq. as to the claims\n\nagainst the school system, and that there exists a common nucleus\n\nof operative facts between the state claims and her federal claims\n\nsufficient to establish supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1367.\n\n          With certain exceptions not applicable here, a federal\n\ncourt may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims\n\n\"that are so related to claims in the action within [a court's]\n\noriginal jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or\n\ncontroversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"4\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).   While it might be questioned whether Godin's\n\nstate-law claims that her job termination was caused by defamatory\n\ncomments from the individual defendants arise out of the same\n\n\n\n     4\n          Section    1367(a)   further   provides    that   \"[s]uch\nsupplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the\njoinder or intervention of additional parties.\"        28 U.S.C. §\n1367(a). That § 1367(a) confers on federal courts jurisdiction\nover state-law claims against non-diverse parties--often termed\n\"pendent party jurisdiction\"--is particularly clear in light of\nthat statute's origins. See 13D Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure § 3567, at 320-23 (3d ed. 2008) (describing § 1367's\nenactment as directly responsive to the Supreme Court's holding in\nFinley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), that the Federal Tort\nClaims Act does not allow for the assertion of pendent jurisdiction\nover additional parties).\n\n                                  -7-\n\ftransaction as her federal claim that the schools did not afford\n\ndue process in reaching the termination decision, that is not the\n\ntest.       See Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England Inc., 603 F.3d\n\n71, 88 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"No Supreme Court case had ever established\n\nthe same transaction-or-occurrence test as the boundary of Article\n\nIII case-or-controversy requirement.\" (citing United Mine Workers\n\nof America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966))).                     We conclude it\n\nwould       not   offend   the   Constitution         to    assert     supplemental\n\njurisdiction       over    Godin's      state-law      claims.5        Accordingly,\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction exists over Godin's state-law claims\n\nunder § 1367(a).\n\nB.             Appellate     Jurisdiction:            The    Collateral       Order\n               Doctrine\n\n               Godin   objects   that    we    lack    appellate      jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the order denying application of Section 556 does not\n\nmeet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.                        \"The\n\nburden of establishing jurisdiction rests with the party who\n\nasserts its existence,\" here the three individual defendants.\n\nCampbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp., 407 F.3d 546, 551 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          Because the issue is one of whether there is subject-\nmatter jurisdiction based on the pleadings, we reach this\nconclusion having accepted as true the well-pleaded facts of\nGodin's complaint and assessed them in the light most favorable to\nher theory of liability.    See United States ex rel. Duxbury v.\nOrtho Biotech Prods., L.P., 579 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                         -8-\n\f            The collateral order doctrine \"allows courts to hear\n\nappeals from judgments that are not complete and final if they\n\n'fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right\n\nseparable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,\n\ntoo important to be denied review and too independent of the cause\n\nitself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until\n\nthe whole case is adjudicated.'\"           Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico,\n\n353 F.3d 108, 123 n.13 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949)).          For the collateral\n\norder doctrine to apply, the interlocutory order must present: (1)\n\na conclusive decision, (2) distinct from the merits of the action,\n\n(3)   on   an   important   issue,   (4)    which   would   effectively   be\n\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Awuah v. Coverall N.\n\nAm. Inc., 585 F.3d 479, 480 (1st Cir. 2009); see also Will v.\n\nHallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349 (2006).\n\n            Three federal circuit decisions hold there is appellate\n\njurisdiction over an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss,\n\nHilton v. Hallmark Cards, 580 F.3d 874, 880 (9th Cir. 2009), Henry,\n\n566 F.3d at 181, and Batzel v. Smith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1024-26 (9th\n\nCir. 2003), while one, also from the Ninth Circuit, holds to the\n\ncontrary, see Englert v. MacDonnell, 551 F.3d 1099 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n            The issue here is narrower and concerned only with the\n\nimmediate appealability of an order that a state anti-SLAPP statute\n\ndoes not apply at all to federal court proceedings due to Federal\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fRules 12 and 56.         We defer to another day resolution of the\n\nquestion of whether an order addressed to the merits of a ruling\n\nunder an anti-SLAPP statute is immediately appealable.\n\n            We   have   appellate   jurisdiction.      First,      the   order\n\nconclusively decides that relief under Maine's Section 556 is\n\nunavailable to the individual defendants. The relevant inquiry for\n\ncollateral    order     doctrine   purposes   is   whether   the   order    is\n\nconclusive as to \"the disputed question,\" not the action as a\n\nwhole.    Will, 546 U.S. at 349 (quoting Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer\n\nAuth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993)).\n\n            Second, the issue of whether a defendant can utilize\n\nSection 556 in federal court is distinct from the merits of Godin's\n\naction.     The legal issue before us is not so intertwined with\n\nfactual issues as to make it \"highly unlikely to affect, or even be\n\nconsequential to, anyone aside from the parties.\"            Lee-Barnes v.\n\nPuerto Ven Quarry Corp., 513 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Third, this appeal raises an important issue of law\n\nbecause the issue raised is \"weightier than the societal interests\n\nadvanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.\"6\n\nId. (quoting Gill v. Gulfstream Park Racing Ass'n Inc., 399 F.3d\n\n391, 399 (1st Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted).              The\n\nseminal Supreme Court case of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\n\n\n     6\n          Because of the important public interests at stake, Will\nv. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 353 (2006), contrary to Godin's\narguments, reinforces our conclusion.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fCorp. itself involved an interlocutory appeal from a district\n\ncourt's determination that a state statute was not applicable to a\n\nstate-law claim brought in federal court.7    337 U.S. at 546.   The\n\nCohen court permitted interlocutory review, and in so doing, carved\n\nout the collateral order doctrine. Likewise, the parallel question\n\nof whether this state anti-SLAPP statute applies to a state-law\n\nclaim brought in federal court qualifies as \"too important to be\n\ndenied review.\"   Id.\n\n          Finally, the order appealed from would be effectively\n\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.    It is relevant, but\n\nnot conclusive, that the Maine Supreme Court's interpretation of\n\nSection 556 has led it to permit interlocutory appeals of orders\n\ndenying special motions to dismiss in its own courts, because \"a\n\nfailure to grant review of these decisions at this stage would\n\nimpose additional litigation costs on defendants, the very harm the\n\nstatute seeks to avoid, and would result in a loss of defendants'\n\nsubstantial rights.\"    Schelling v. Lindell, 942 A.2d 1226, 1229-30\n\n(Me. 2008); see also Maietta Const., Inc. v. Wainwright, 847 A.2d\n\n1169, 1173 (Me. 2004) (discussing purpose of Section 556).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          The New Jersey statute at issue in Cohen made the\nplaintiff in a stockholder's derivative action \"liable for all\nexpenses, including attorney's fees, of the defense\" and required\n\"security for their payment as a condition of prosecuting the\naction.\" Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 543\n(1949).\n\n                                -11-\n\f            That is relevant not because state law determines the\n\navailability of appellate review here--it does not--but rather\n\nbecause \"lawmakers wanted to protect speakers from the trial itself\n\nrather than merely from liability.\"         Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1025; see\n\nalso Englert, 551 F.3d at 1107 (whether state anti-SLAPP statute\n\nprovides    for   interlocutory   appeals    is   significant   to   whether\n\ninterlocutory appeals should be permitted in federal courts).8\n\nThere is a \"crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and\n\na right whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges.\"             Midland\n\nAsphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 801 (1989) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U.S. 263, 269 (1982)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). We conclude that the order at\n\nissue here involves \"an asserted right the legal and practical\n\nvalue of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before\n\ntrial.\"     Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 499 (1989)\n\n(quoting Midland Asphalt Corp., 489 U.S. at 799) (quotation mark\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          Godin's reliance on Englert is thus misplaced. There, in\ndismissing the defendants' consolidated interlocutory appeals on\nthe basis that an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion could be\neffectively reviewed after final judgment, the Ninth Circuit found\nit important that Oregon's anti-SLAPP statute did not itself make\ninterlocutory appeals available in state-court proceedings.\nEnglert v. MacDonnell, 551 F.3d 1099, 1106-07 (9th Cir. 2009).\nEnglert, with its heavy reliance on the view of Oregon law\nregarding the availability of interlocutory appeals, cuts against\nGodin's position given the availability of such appeals in this\ncontext under Maine law.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          The district court's order rests on a determination of\n\nlaw, which we review de novo.     See Levin v. Dalva Bros. Inc., 459\n\nF.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 2006).    It is often said that a federal court\n\nsitting in diversity jurisdiction9 applies the state's substantive\n\nlaw and the federal procedural rules.      See Gasperini v. Ctr. for\n\nHumanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996); Erie R. Co. v. Thompson, 304\n\nU.S. 64 (1938); Hoyos v. Telecorp. Comm., Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. General Elec.\n\nDel Caribe, Inc., 145 F.3d 463, 478 (1st Cir. 1998).10   At the same\n\ntime, there is what we have called \"an enduring conundrum--the line\n\nbetween substance and procedure.\"       United States v. Poland, 562\n\nF.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2009).      What are matters of substance and\n\nwhat are matters of procedure is difficult to distinguish, and the\n\ntwo are not mutually exclusive categories.    Shady Grove Orthopedic\n\nAssocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S. Ct. 1431, 1450 (2010)\n\n(Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n     9\n          Our analysis regarding this pendent state-law claim\nproceeds as it would were this a state-law claim brought in federal\ncourt by virtue of diversity jurisdiction. See Doty v. Sewall, 908\nF.2d 1053, 1063 (1st Cir. 1990).\n     10\n          We have held that a nominally procedural state rule\nauthorizing an award of attorney's fees as a sanction for obstinate\nlitigation is substantive for purposes of Erie analysis. Servicios\nComerciales Andinos, S.A. v. Gen. Elec. Del Caribe, Inc., 145 F.3d\n463, 478 (1st Cir. 1998). State conflict of laws rules are also\nconsidered substantive. Day & Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423\nU.S. 3, 4 (1975).\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            Here,   the   issue   falls   into   the   special   category\n\nconcerning the relationship between the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure and a state statute that governs both procedure and\n\nsubstance in the state courts.      The issue is whether Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56 preclude application of Section\n\n556 in federal court.       This is not the classic Erie question.\n\nCompare Erie R. Co., 304 U.S. 64, with Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S.\n\n460 (1965).\n\n            Until the last several decades, federal courts addressing\n\nsimilar issues posed the relevant question, as articulated in\n\nWalker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740 (1980), as whether there\n\nwas a \"direct conflict\" between a state law and a federal rule of\n\ncivil procedure.      Id. at 752.     That is no longer the initial\n\nquestion.   See Stewart Org., Inc., v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 26\n\n& n.4 (1988).11 In getting at the potential rub in the relationship\n\nbetween a Federal Rule of Procedure and the state law, courts now\n\nask if the federal rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue\n\nbefore the court.\"    Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1451 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring) (quoting Walker, 446 U.S. at 749-50).        If so, then the\n\n\n\n     11\n          This shift was described in our opinion in Gil de Rebollo\nv. Miami Heat Ass'ns, Inc., 137 F.3d 56, 65 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998).\nOne concern motivating the shift was the fact that it \"would make\nno sense for the supremacy of federal law to wane precisely because\nthere is no state law directly on point.\" Stewart Org., Inc. v.\nRicoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 26 n.4 (1988). Another concern may well\nbe that the supremacy of the Federal Rules should not depend only\non whether there is a direct conflict.\n\n                                   -14-\n\ffederal     rule   must   be   given    effect   despite    the   existence   of\n\ncompeting state law so long as the rule complies with the Rules\n\nEnabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072.12          Id.\n\n             We conclude that neither Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) nor\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56, on a straightforward reading of its language,\n\nwas meant to control the particular issues under Section 556 before\n\nthe district court.        Given this result we do not reach the next\n\nlevel question as to whether Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 comply with the\n\nRules Enabling Act.\n\n             Our conclusion that Rules 12 (particularly Rule 12(b)(6))\n\nand 56 do not control Section 556 proceedings does not end the\n\nanalysis.     If a federal rule is not so broad as to control the\n\nissues raised, a federal court might nonetheless decline to apply\n\nstate law if so declining would better advance the dual aims of\n\nErie:      \"discouragement     of      forum-shopping      and    avoidance   of\n\ninequitable administration of the laws.\"            Hanna, 380 U.S. at 468;\n\nsee also Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1437; Walker, 446 U.S. at 752-\n\n53.     As to this prong of the analysis, we hold that the dual\n\npurposes of Erie are best served by enforcement of Section 556 in\n\nfederal court.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n          The caveat exists because \"[t]he [Federal] Civil Rules\ncannot roam at will.\"   McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., 950\nF.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 1991).     They must relate to practice or\nprocedure, 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a), and may not \"abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify any substantive right,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fA.        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56 are not\n          Sufficiently Broad to Control Section 556 Proceedings\n\n          The test of whether a federal rule is \"sufficiently broad\n\nto control the issue before the court,\" Walker, 446 U.S. at 749-50,\n\nwas most recently examined by the Supreme Court in Shady Grove, 130\n\nS. Ct. 1431.   The question presented was whether a New York Rule,\n\nN.Y.C.P.L.R. § 901(b), which prevents parties from bringing class\n\naction lawsuits on claims seeking the minimum measure of recovery\n\nimposed by statute, was preempted by Fed. R.       Civ. P. 23 in\n\ndiversity cases.    Writing for a five member majority, Justice\n\nScalia concluded that, because § 901(b) \"attempts to answer the\n\nsame question\" as Rule 23, namely, the categorical question of when\n\na class action may be brought, § 901(b) could not be applied to bar\n\nclass actions in federal diversity cases, so long as Rule 23\n\ncomplies with the Rules Enabling Act.   Id. at 1437.\n\n          Joined only by three other Justices, Justice Scalia went\n\non to reason that Rule 23's validity under the Rules Enabling Act\n\ndepends entirely on whether it \"really regulate[s] procedure,\"\n\nwhich he concluded it did.      Id. at 1442 (plurality opinion)\n\n(quoting Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)).     This\n\nconclusion was reached without any inquiry into whether § 901(b)\n\nwas procedural or substantive, as in his view that question \"makes\n\nno difference\" for Rules Enabling Act purposes.   Id. at 1444.\n\n          Justice Stevens joined the Court's narrow holding that\n\nRule 23 was sufficiently broad to preempt § 901(b), and that Rule\n\n                               -16-\n\f23 complied with the Rules Enabling Act.          Id. at 1448 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring).      But in a concurring opinion, joined in relevant part\n\nby four other Justices, he held that whether a Federal Rule is\n\nvalid under the Rules Enabling Act depends not on the Federal Rule\n\nalone, but also on the nature of the state rule it seeks to\n\ndisplace.     Id. at 1452-53.    The critical question is not \"whether\n\nthe state law at issue takes the form of what is traditionally\n\ndescribed as substantive or procedural,\" but rather \"whether the\n\nstate law actually is part of a State's framework of substantive\n\nrights or remedies.\"       Id. at 1449.    Justice Stevens also noted that\n\nthis inquiry under the Rules Enabling Act \"may well bleed back\"\n\ninto the inquiry of whether a Federal Rule is sufficiently broad to\n\ncontrol the issue before the court.             Id. at 1452.     This is so\n\nbecause a Federal Rule \"cannot govern a particular case in which\n\nthe rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the\n\nordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right\n\nor   remedy    that   it    functions     to   define   the   scope   of   the\n\nstate-created right.\" Id. To avoid such a result, the concurrence\n\nconcludes, \"[w]hen a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge, or\n\nmodify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether\n\nthe rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible\n\nresult.\"    Id.\n\n            The Court's fractured holding regarding when a Federal\n\nRule is \"sufficiently broad\" to control an issue of state law is\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fgiven content by other language used by the Court.           The concepts of\n\ncongruence, co-extensiveness, difference, and direct or indirect\n\nconflict continue to play a role in the analysis.           Shady Grove uses\n\nthe language of \"potential conflict,\" \"compatible\" and \"collision\n\nwith state law.\" Id. at 1440-42 (majority opinion). The plurality\n\nalso characterizes the first step of the analysis as \"determining\n\nwhether the federal and state rules can be reconciled (because they\n\nanswer different questions)\". Id. at 1445 (plurality opinion); see\n\nalso id. at 1451 (Stevens, J., concurring) (stating the first step\n\nof the analysis asks whether the federal rule leaves \"no room for\n\nthe operation of seemingly conflicting state law.\").               Our own case\n\nlaw also provides guidance.        See Morel v. DaimlerChrysler AG, 565\n\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2009) (asking whether the state rule is\n\n\"inconsistent\"); Gil de Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ass'ns, Inc., 137\n\nF.3d    56,    65   n.5   (1st   Cir.    1998)   (asking   about    \"potential\n\nconflict\").     And we give the federal rules a literal reading.           See\n\nWalker, 556 U.S. at 750 n.9.\n\n              We also take some guidance from history. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n23.1, which governs shareholder derivative suits, is not so broad\n\nas to cover some state bond requirements for such suits.                Cohen,\n\n337 U.S. at 555-57.       But the class action Rule 23 is broad enough\n\nto preclude state prohibitions on certain class actions seeking\n\npenalties or statutory minimum damages. Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n1431.    It is also commonly accepted that in diversity cases state\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fstatutes of limitations apply.13        Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326\n\nU.S. 99, 110 (1945).       And Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), governing the\n\nrelation back of complaints, displaces an inconsistent state rule.\n\nMorel, 565 F.3d at 24.\n\n            Applying these principles to the case before us, we\n\nconclude that Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),14 which governs motions to\n\ndismiss on the pleadings, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, which governs\n\nmotions for summary judgment, are not so broad as to cover the\n\nissues within the scope of Section 556.          To use the language of\n\nShady Grove, Rules 12 and 56 do not \"attempt[] to answer the same\n\nquestion,\" Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1437, nor do they \"address\n\nthe same subject,\" id. at 1440, as Section 556.\n\n            Federal Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 are addressed to different\n\n(but related) subject-matters.          Section 556 on its face is not\n\naddressed to either of these procedures, which are general federal\n\nprocedures governing all categories of cases.          Section 556 is only\n\naddressed   to   special   procedures    for   state   claims   based   on   a\n\n\n\n     13\n          As a consequence, state rules that are integral to the\nstate statute of limitations usually apply in federal court;\nfederal rules are not so broad as to cover these state rules. See\n17A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 124.03[2][a] (3d\ned. 2009).    For example, Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, which concerns\ncommencing an action in federal court, is not broad enough to\ncontrol state laws integral to the limitations issue. See Walker,\n446 U.S. at 751-52.\n     14\n          Our analysis with regard to Rule 12(b)(6) applies with\nequal force to Rule 12(c), which Godin also asserts preempts\nSection 556. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\n\n                                  -19-\n\fdefendant's petitioning activity. In contrast to the state statute\n\nin Shady Grove, Section 556 does not seek to displace the Federal\n\nRules or have Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 cease to function.             Cf. Morel,\n\n565 F.3d at 24.       In addition, Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 do not purport\n\nto apply only to suits challenging the defendants' exercise of\n\ntheir constitutional petitioning rights.         Maine itself has general\n\nprocedural rules which are the equivalents of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6) and 56.       See Me. R. Civ. P. 12; Me. R. Civ. P. 56.         That\n\nfact further supports the view that Maine has not created a\n\nsubstitute to the Federal Rules, but instead created a supplemental\n\nand substantive rule to provide added protections, beyond those in\n\nRules 12 and 56, to defendants who are named as parties because of\n\nconstitutional petitioning activities.\n\n           Rule 12(b)(6) serves to provide a mechanism to test the\n\nsufficiency of the complaint.         See Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 129 S. Ct.\n\n1937, 1949 (2009).       Section 556, by contrast, provides a mechanism\n\nfor a defendant to move to dismiss a claim on an entirely different\n\nbasis:   that   the    claims   in   question   rest   on   the   defendant's\n\nprotected petitioning conduct and that the plaintiff cannot meet\n\nthe special rules Maine has created to protect such petitioning\n\nactivity against lawsuits.\n\n           The federal summary judgment rule, Rule 56, creates a\n\nprocess for parties to secure judgment before trial on the basis\n\nthat there are no disputed material issues of fact, and as a matter\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fof law, one party is entitled to judgment.             Inherent in Rule 56 is\n\nthat a fact-finder's evaluation of material factual disputes is not\n\nrequired. But Section 556 serves the entirely distinct function of\n\nprotecting those specific defendants that have been targeted with\n\nlitigation    on     the    basis    of    their   protected    speech.         When\n\napplicable, Section 556 requires a court to consider whether the\n\ndefendant's conduct had a reasonable basis in fact or law, and\n\nwhether that conduct caused actual injury.                  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56\n\ncannot be said to control those issues.\n\n            Section 556 has both substantive and procedural aspects.\n\nOne of the substantive aspects of Section 556 shifts the burden to\n\nplaintiff    to    defeat      the   special     motion.     Section      556   also\n\ndetermines the scope of plaintiff's burden, requiring plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate       that   the    defendant's      activity    \"(1)   was    without\n\n'reasonable factual support,' and (2) was without an 'arguable\n\nbasis in law.'\"          Schelling, 942 A.2d at 1229 (quoting Me. Rev.\n\nStat. tit. 14, § 556).          Further, Section 556 substantively alters\n\nthe type of harm actionable--that is, plaintiff must show the\n\ndefendant's conduct \"resulted in 'actual injury' to the plaintiff.\"\n\nId. (quoting Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, § 556).15\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          In addition, Section 556 allows courts to award\nattorney's fees and costs to a defendant that successfully brings\na special motion to dismiss, a statutory element we have previously\ndetermined to be substantive. See Servicios Comerciales Andinos,\nS.A., 145 F.3d at 478.\n\n                                          -21-\n\f              Neither Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed. R. Civ. P. 56\n\ndetermines which party bears the burden of proof on a state-law\n\ncreated cause of action.          See, e.g., Coll v. PB Diagnostic Syst.,\n\nInc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1121 (1st Cir. 1995).              And it is long settled\n\nthat the allocation of burden of proof is substantive in nature and\n\ncontrolled by state law.           Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117\n\n(1943); Am. Title Ins. Co. v. E. W. Fin. Corp., 959 F.2d 345, 348\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n              Further, Section 556 provides substantive legal defenses\n\nto defendants and alters what plaintiffs must prove to prevail. It\n\nis not the province of either Rule 12 or Rule 56 to supply\n\nsubstantive defenses or the elements of plaintiffs' proof to causes\n\nof action, either state or federal.16\n\n              Because Section 556 is \"so intertwined with a state right\n\nor     remedy   that    it   functions     to    define    the    scope   of   the\n\nstate-created right,\" it cannot be displaced by Rule 12(b)(6) or\n\nRule    56.     Shady    Grove,    130    S.    Ct.   at   1452   (Stevens,    J.,\n\nconcurring).      Further, if Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 were thought to\n\n\n\n       16\n          The similarities between Section 556 and Rules 12 and 56\nas mechanisms to efficiently dispose with meritless claims before\ntrial occurs does not resolve the issue.       Such an abstracted\nframing of the breadth of the Federal Rules is inappropriate. See\nShady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S.\nCt. 1431, 1441 n.7 (2010) (embracing the suggestion that Federal\nRules should be read \"to avoid 'substantial variations [in\noutcomes] between state and federal litigation'\") (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Semtek Int'l Inc., v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531\nU.S. 497, 504 (2001)).\n\n                                         -22-\n\fpreempt application of all of Section 556, a serious question might\n\nbe raised under the Rules Enabling Act.      Id. In light of our\n\nconclusion that Section 556 is not displaced, we need not reach\n\nthis issue.\n\n          Given that neither Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56 is so broad as to encompass the special Section 556\n\nproceedings, we might go no further.       We do acknowledge the\n\ndistrict court's concern about some differences in the mechanics,\n\nparticularly as to the record on which the motion is evaluated.\n\nWhether the procedures outlined in Section 556 will in fact depart\n\nfrom those of Rule 12 and Rule 56 will depend on the particulars in\n\na given case of the claim and defense.   Some Section 556 motions,\n\nlike Rule 12(b)(6) motions,17 will be resolved on the pleadings.\n\nIn other cases, Section 556 will permit courts to look beyond the\n\npleadings to affidavits and materials of record, as Rule 56 does.\n\nIn this way, some Section 556 motions, depending on the particulars\n\nof a case, will be resolved just as summary judgment motions under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56 are.\n\n          Godin emphasizes that Section 556 has the potential in a\n\nparticular case to give the individual defendants a dispositive\n\nruling without affording discovery, thus bringing Section 556 in\n\n\n     17\n          Even in assessing 12(b)(6) motions, the scope of\nmaterials considered depends somewhat on the particular case. For\nexample, courts can take account of materials outside the pleadings\nif they are undisputed matters of public record.         See In re\nColonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                               -23-\n\fconflict with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.    Cf. Metabolife, 264 F.3d at 845-\n\n47.   Godin has not shown any actual conflict.     While Section 556\n\nprovides that discovery proceedings are stayed upon the filing of\n\na special motion to dismiss, the statute also provides that a court\n\nmay, upon good cause shown, order that specific discovery be\n\nconducted.   Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, § 556.    The Maine statute, in\n\nimposing on the opponent of the motion the burden of justifying\n\ndiscovery, is consistent with the allocation of burdens under Rule\n\n56(d), formerly Rule 56(f).18       If a federal court would allow\n\ndiscovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) then, in our view, that would\n\nconstitute good cause under the Maine statute.\n\n           The limiting effect that Section 556 has on discovery is\n\nnot materially different from the effect of Rule 12 proceedings\n\nand, in some instances, Rule 56 proceedings.     Neither Rule 12 nor\n\nRule 56 of the federal rules of procedure purport to be so broad as\n\nto preclude additional mechanisms meant to curtail rights-dampening\n\nlitigation through the modification of pleading standards.

L.\n\nNo. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737, is        a federal version of such an\n\nadditional mechanism to the Federal Rules, meant to apply to a\n\ndiscrete category of cases.   \"Designed to curb perceived abuses of\n\n\n      18\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 was amended, effective December 1,\n2010. The substance of the rule has not materially changed. We\nfind it just and practicable to cite the new rule. See Silva v.\nWitschen, 19 F.3d 725, 727-29 (1st Cir. 1994); Freund v. Fleetwood\nEnters., Inc., 956 F.2d 354, 363 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                -24-\n\fthe § 10(b) private action,\" the PSLRA created a higher standard\n\nfor pleading scienter in any § 10(b) claim.19                Tellabs, Inc. v.\n\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 320, 321 (2007).                 We\n\nrecognize that the fact that Congress may create special procedures\n\nin addition to those under the Federal Rules does not itself mean\n\nthat the Federal Rules would not displace a similar state-law\n\nspecial procedure.        See Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1438.          Still,\n\nthe existence of the PSLRA provides some support to our conclusion\n\nthat Congress, in approving Rules 12 and 56, did not intend to\n\npreclude special rules designed to make it more difficult to bring\n\ncertain types of actions where state law defines the cause of\n\naction.\n\n             In sum, \"there is no indication that Rules . . . 12 and\n\n56 were intended to 'occupy the field' with respect to pretrial\n\nprocedures aimed at weeding out meritless claims.\"               Newsham, 190\n\nF.3d    at   972;   see   also   Henry,   566   F.3d   at   169-70   (enforcing\n\nLouisiana's anti-SLAPP statute in federal court). Rather, Rules 12\n\nand 56 \"can exist side by side\" with Section 556, \"each controlling\n\nits own intended sphere of coverage without conflict.\"                Newsham,\n\n\n\n       19\n          \"Under the PSLRA's heightened pleading instructions, any\nprivate securities complaint alleging that the defendant made a\nfalse or misleading statement must: (1) 'specify each statement\nalleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the\nstatement is misleading' . . . and (2) 'state with particularity\nfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind.'\" Tellabs, Inc., 551 U.S. at 321\n(citing 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)).\n\n                                      -25-\n\f190 F.3d at 972 (quoting Walker, 446 U.S. at 752) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\nB.         Declining to Apply Section 556 in Federal Court Would\n           Disserve the Dual Aims of Erie\n\n           Here, application of Section 556 would best serve the\n\n\"'twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum shopping and\n\ninequitable administration of the laws.'\"               Commercial Union Ins.\n\nCo. v.

Co., 41 F.3d 764, 773 (quoting Stewart, 487\n\nU.S. at 27 n.6 (1988)).          \"If application of federal law would\n\ndisserve these two policies, state law applies.\"              Id.\n\n           Plainly,    Section    556     substantively     alters    Maine-law\n\nclaims that are based on a defendant's protected petitioning\n\nactivity by shifting the burden to the plaintiff and altering the\n\nshowing the plaintiff must make.           Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, § 556.\n\nSection   556   also   allows    courts    to   award    attorney's    fees   to\n\nprevailing defendants, and alters the traditional common-law rule\n\nthat, in libel cases, a plaintiff need not demonstrate specific\n\ndamages to recover on a claim, as alleging \"damages per se\" does\n\nnot satisfy Section 556's actual injury standard.              See Schelling,\n\n942 A.2d at 1232 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 569, cmt.\n\nb (1977)).\n\n           Declining to apply Section 556 in federal court would\n\nthus result in an inequitable administration of justice between a\n\ndefense asserted in state court and the same defense asserted in\n\nfederal court.     See Commercial Union Ins. Co., 41 F.3d at 773.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fLikewise, were Section 556 not to apply in federal court, the\n\nincentives for forum shopping would be strong: electing to bring\n\nstate-law claims in federal as opposed to state court would allow\n\na plaintiff to avoid Section 556's burden-shifting framework, rely\n\nupon the common law's per se damages rule, and circumvent any\n\nliability for a defendant's attorney's fees or costs.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          Because neither Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56 is sufficiently broad to control the issues raised by the\n\nindividual defendants' Section 556 special motion, we conclude the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying the motion on the basis that\n\nSection 556 was displaced.   Holding to the contrary would deprive\n\nthe individual defendants of Section 556 protection solely on\n\naccount of the fact that they are joined as defendants in this\n\nlitigation with Machiasport and the Union, against whom federal\n\nclaims are raised.    Such an outcome would directly contravene\n\nErie's aims.\n\n          We reverse the district court's order, and remand so that\n\nthe district court may consider the merits of the individual\n\ndefendants' special motion to dismiss under Section 556 in the\n\nfirst instance.

She also sued three individual school system employees who had separately stated in meetings with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> officials their views that Godin had acted abusively toward students at the school. Plaintiff brought state-law claims that these allegations were defamatory and led the school system to terminate her employment; the school system says her job was terminated due to budgetary shortfalls.</p>\n<p>Many states have enacted special statutory protections for individuals, like the individual school system employees in this case, named as defendants as a result of the exercise of their constitutional rights to petition the government. These anti-\"SLAPP\" (\"strategic litigation against public participation\") laws provide such defendants with procedural and substantive defenses meant to prevent meritless suits from imposing significant litigation costs and chilling protected speech. The two federal appellate courts that have addressed whether they must enforce these state anti-SLAPP statutes in federal proceedings have concluded that they must. <i>See </i><i>Henry v. Lake Charles Am. Press, LLC,</i> 566 F.3d 164 (5th Cir.2009); <i>United States ex rel. Newsham v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co.,</i> 190 F.3d 963 (9th Cir. 1999). <i>See also </i><i>Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick,</i> 264 F.3d 832, 845-47 (9th Cir. 2001) (limiting application of one anti-SLAPP provision where information was within exclusive control of the defendant). This question, here as it applies to Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, is one of first impression for this court, and lies at the center of this appeal. We hold the Maine anti-SLAPP statute must be applied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Basic background facts set the stage. Shortly after Godin began working as a teacher and principal at the Fort O'Brien Elementary School in August 2006, Machiasport began receiving complaints from other employees concerning her conduct toward students, including complaints from the three individual defendants, Patty Schencks, Joleen Nicely, and Donna Metta.<sup>[1]</sup> Machiasport conducted an investigation of Godin's conduct in May 2008. The June 4, 2008 investigation report concluded that the allegations that Godin's conduct was abusive and inappropriate were not supported.</p>\n<p>Two days after the report was issued, Godin received notice from the Superintendent of Machiasport Schools that her employment contract, which would have expired in 2011, was being terminated due to budgetary constraints caused by \"significant subsidy loss.\" Godin was told that her position would be filled by a \"teaching principal,\" which occurred on August 12, 2008.</p>\n<p>On March 2, 2009, Godin brought suit in federal court, asserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Union and Machiasport, and a number of state claims, including claims against the individual defendants for interference with advantageous contractual relationships and defamation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The individual defendants filed a special motion to dismiss under Maine's anti-SLAPP <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> statute, which creates a special process by which a defendant may move to dismiss any claim that arises from the defendant's exercise of the right of petition under either the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine.<sup>[3]</sup> Me. Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556 (\"Section 556\"). Godin does not dispute that her claims against the individual defendants are based on conduct that falls within the statute's broad definition of \"a party's exercise of its right of petition.\" Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556.</p>\n<p>The statute provides that once a defendant brings such a \"special motion to dismiss\" and demonstrates that the claims in question are based on the defendant's petitioning activity, the court \"shall advance [the motion] so that it may be heard and determined with as little delay as possible.\" <i>Id.</i> The court shall grant the special motion \"unless the party against whom the special motion is made shows that the moving party's exercise of its right of petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and that the moving party's acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\" <i>Id.</i> In assessing whether to grant the special motion, \"the court shall consider the pleading and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\" <i>Id.</i> A court may order discovery specific to the Section 556 motion for good cause shown. <i>Id.</i> Evidence considered in reviewing a special motion to dismiss should be viewed \"in the light most favorable to the moving party because the responding party bears the burden of proof when the statute applies.\" <i>Morse Bros., Inc. v. Webster,</i> 772 A.2d 842, 849 (Me.2001).</p>\n<p>The district court denied the individual defendants' special motion under Section 556, holding that Section 556 conflicts with Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 and 56 and so does not apply in federal court.</p>\n<p>This interlocutory appeal raises issues of first impression within this circuit, namely: (1) whether, under the collateral order doctrine, this court has appellate jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a special motion to dismiss brought under Section 556 on the basis that Section 556 cannot be reconciled with federal procedure; and (2) whether Section 556 applies in federal court proceedings. We hold on the facts here that we have appellate jurisdiction and that the district court erred in not applying Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. We reverse and remand for further proceedings, including proceedings under Section 556.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We address two preliminary jurisdictional issues: (1) whether federal subject-matter jurisdiction exists over the state-law claims against the non-diverse individual defendants even though no federal claim has been brought against them, and (2) whether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the individual defendants' interlocutory appeal by virtue of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> A. <i>Federal Subject-Matter Jurisdiction: The Supplemental Jurisdiction Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although the parties have not questioned subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims at issue, \"a court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction, and to proceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.\" <i>In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> 859 F.2d 1000, 1002 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>In her complaint, Godin asserts federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 <i>et seq.</i> as to the claims against the school system, and that there exists a common nucleus of operative facts between the state claims and her federal claims sufficient to establish supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.</p>\n<p>With certain exceptions not applicable here, a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims \"that are so related to claims in the action within [a court's] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"<sup>[4]</sup> 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). While it might be questioned whether Godin's state-law claims that her job termination was caused by defamatory comments from the individual defendants arise out of the same transaction as her federal claim that the schools did not afford due process in reaching the termination decision, that is not the test. <i>See </i><i>Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England Inc.,</i> 603 F.3d 71, 88 (1st Cir.2010) (\"No Supreme Court case had ever established the same transaction-or-occurrence test as the boundary of Article III case-or-controversy requirement.\" (citing <i>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966))). We conclude it would not offend the Constitution to assert supplemental jurisdiction over Godin's state-law claims.<sup>[5]</sup> Accordingly, supplemental jurisdiction exists over Godin's state-law claims under § 1367(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Appellate Jurisdiction: The Collateral Order Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Godin objects that we lack appellate jurisdiction, arguing that the order denying application of Section 556 does not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine. \"The burden of establishing jurisdiction rests with the party who asserts its existence,\" here the three individual defendants. <i>Campbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp.,</i> 407 F.3d 546, 551 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The collateral order doctrine \"allows courts to hear appeals from judgments that are not complete and final if they `fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.'\" <i>Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 123 n. 13 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)). For the collateral order doctrine to apply, the interlocutory order must present: (1) a conclusive decision, (2) distinct from the merits of the action, (3) on an important issue, (4) which would effectively be unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <i>Awuah v. Coverall N. Am. Inc.,</i> 585 F.3d 479, 480 (1st Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Will v. Hallock,</i> 546 U.S. 345, 349, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006).</p>\n<p>Three federal circuit decisions hold there is appellate jurisdiction over an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss, <i>Hilton v. Hallmark Cards,</i> 580 F.3d 874, 880 (9th Cir.2009), <i>Henry,</i> 566 F.3d at 181, and <i>Batzel v. Smith,</i> 333 F.3d 1018, 1024-26 (9th Cir.2003), while one, also from the Ninth Circuit, holds to the contrary, <i>see </i><i>Englert v. MacDonell,</i> 551 F.3d 1099 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The issue here is narrower and concerned only with the immediate appealability of an order that a state anti-SLAPP statute does not apply at all to federal court proceedings due to Federal Rules 12 and 56. We defer to another day resolution of the question of whether an order addressed to the merits of a ruling under an anti-SLAPP statute is immediately appealable.</p>\n<p>We have appellate jurisdiction. First, the order conclusively decides that relief under Maine's Section 556 is unavailable to the individual defendants. The relevant inquiry for collateral order doctrine purposes is whether the order is conclusive as to \"the disputed question,\" not the action as a whole. <i>Will,</i> 546 U.S. at 349, 126 S.Ct. 952 (quoting <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993)).</p>\n<p>Second, the issue of whether a defendant can utilize Section 556 in federal court is distinct from the merits of Godin's action. The legal issue before us is not so intertwined with factual issues as to make it \"highly unlikely to affect, or even be consequential to, anyone aside from the parties.\" <i>Lee-Barnes v. Puerto Ven Quarry Corp.,</i> 513 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>Third, this appeal raises an important issue of law because the issue raised is \"weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.\"<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gill v. Gulfstream Park Racing Ass'n Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 391, 399 (1st Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The seminal Supreme Court case of <i>Cohen v. Beneficial</i><i> Industrial Loan Corporation</i> itself involved an interlocutory appeal from a district court's determination that a state statute was not applicable to a state-law claim brought in federal court.<sup>[7]</sup> 337 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221. The <i>Cohen</i> court permitted interlocutory review, and in so doing, carved out the collateral order doctrine. Likewise, the parallel question of whether this state anti-SLAPP statute applies to a state-law claim brought in federal court qualifies as \"too important to be denied review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the order appealed from would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. It is relevant, but not conclusive, that the Maine Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 556 has led it to permit interlocutory appeals of orders denying special motions to dismiss in its own courts, because \"a failure to grant review of these decisions at this stage would impose additional litigation costs on defendants, the very harm the statute seeks to avoid, and would result in a loss of defendants' substantial rights.\" <i>Schelling v. Lindell,</i> 942 A.2d 1226, 1229-30 (Me.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Maietta Const., Inc. v. Wainwright,</i> 847 A.2d 1169, 1173 (Me. 2004) (discussing purpose of Section 556).</p>\n<p>That is relevant not because state law determines the availability of appellate review hereit does notbut rather because \"lawmakers wanted to protect speakers from the trial itself rather than merely from liability.\" <i>Batzel,</i> 333 F.3d at 1025; <i>see also </i><i>Englert,</i> 551 F.3d at 1107 (whether state anti-SLAPP statute provides for interlocutory appeals is significant to whether interlocutory appeals should be permitted in federal courts).<sup>[8]</sup> There is a \"crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges.\" <i>Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 794, 801, 109 S.Ct. 1494, 103 L.Ed.2d 879 (1989) (quoting <i>United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co.,</i> 458 U.S. 263, 269, 102 S.Ct. 3081, 73 L.Ed.2d 754 (1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the order at issue here involves \"an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\" <i>Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser,</i> 490 U.S. 495, 499, 109 S.Ct. 1976, 104 L.Ed.2d 548 (1989) (quoting <i>Midland Asphalt Corp.,</i> 489 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 1494) (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The district court's order rests on a determination of law, which we review de novo. <i>See </i><i>Levin v. Dalva Bros. Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2006). It is often said that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction<sup>[9]</sup> applies the state's substantive law and the federal procedural rules. <i>See </i><i>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996); <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <i>Hoyos v. Telecorp. Comm., Inc.,</i> 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. General Elec. Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 145 F.3d 463, 478 (1st Cir.1998).<sup>[10]</sup> At <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> the same time, there is what we have called \"an enduring conundrumthe line between substance and procedure.\" <i>United States v. Poland,</i> 562 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.2009). What are matters of substance and what are matters of procedure is difficult to distinguish, and the two are not mutually exclusive categories. <i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1450, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Here, the issue falls into the special category concerning the relationship between the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and a state statute that governs both procedure and substance in the state courts. The issue is whether Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56 preclude application of Section 556 in federal court. This is not the classic <i>Erie</i> question. <i>Compare </i><i>Erie R. Co.,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, <i>with </i><i>Hanna v. Plumer,</i> 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).</p>\n<p>Until the last several decades, federal courts addressing similar issues posed the relevant question, as articulated in <i>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.,</i> 446 U.S. 740, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980), as whether there was a \"direct conflict\" between a state law and a federal rule of civil procedure. <i>Id.</i> at 752, 100 S.Ct. 1978. That is no longer the initial question. <i>See </i><i>Stewart Org., Inc., v. Ricoh Corp.,</i> 487 U.S. 22, 26 &amp; n. 4, 108 S.Ct. 2239, 101 L.Ed.2d 22 (1988).<sup>[11]</sup> In getting at the potential rub in the relationship between a Federal Rule of Procedure and the state law, courts now ask if the federal rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court.\" <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1451 (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 749-50, 100 S.Ct. 1978). If so, then the federal rule must be given effect despite the existence of competing state law so long as the rule complies with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072.<sup>[12]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We conclude that neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, on a straightforward reading of its language, was meant to control the particular issues under Section 556 before the district court. Given this result we do not reach the next level question as to whether Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 comply with the Rules Enabling Act.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that Rules 12 (particularly Rule 12(b)(6)) and 56 do not control Section 556 proceedings does not end the analysis. If a federal rule is not so broad as to control the issues raised, a federal court might nonetheless decline to apply state law if so declining would better advance the dual aims of <i>Erie</i>: \"discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.\" <i>Hanna,</i> 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. 1136; <i>see</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> <i>also </i><i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1437; <i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 752-53, 100 S.Ct. 1978. As to this prong of the analysis, we hold that the dual purposes of <i>Erie</i> are best served by enforcement of Section 556 in federal court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56 are not Sufficiently Broad to Control Section 556 Proceedings</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The test of whether a federal rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court,\" <i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 749-50, 100 S.Ct. 1978, was most recently examined by the Supreme Court in <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. 1431. The question presented was whether a New York Rule, N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 901(b), which prevents parties from bringing class action lawsuits on claims seeking the minimum measure of recovery imposed by statute, was preempted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 in diversity cases. Writing for a five member majority, Justice Scalia concluded that, because § 901(b) \"attempts to answer the same question\" as Rule 23, namely, the categorical question of when a class action may be brought, § 901(b) could not be applied to bar class actions in federal diversity cases, so long as Rule 23 complies with the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> at 1437.</p>\n<p>Joined only by three other Justices, Justice Scalia went on to reason that Rule 23's validity under the Rules Enabling Act depends entirely on whether it \"really regulate[s] procedure,\" which he concluded it did. <i>Id.</i> at 1442 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co.,</i> 312 U.S. 1, 14, 61 S.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941)). This conclusion was reached without any inquiry into whether § 901(b) was procedural or substantive, as in his view that question \"makes no difference\" for Rules Enabling Act purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 1444.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens joined the Court's narrow holding that Rule 23 was sufficiently broad to preempt § 901(b), and that Rule 23 complied with the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> at 1448 (Stevens, J., concurring). But in a concurring opinion, joined in relevant part by four other Justices, he held that whether a Federal Rule is valid under the Rules Enabling Act depends not on the Federal Rule alone, but also on the nature of the state rule it seeks to displace. <i>Id.</i> at 1452-53. The critical question is not \"whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is traditionally described as substantive or procedural,\" but rather \"whether the state law actually is part of a State's framework of substantive rights or remedies.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1449. Justice Stevens also noted that this inquiry under the Rules Enabling Act \"may well bleed back\" into the inquiry of whether a Federal Rule is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court. <i>Id.</i> at 1452. This is so because a Federal Rule \"cannot govern a particular case in which the rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right.\" <i>Id.</i> To avoid such a result, the concurrence concludes, \"[w]hen a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's fractured holding regarding when a Federal Rule is \"sufficiently broad\" to control an issue of state law is given content by other language used by the Court. The concepts of congruence, co-extensiveness, difference, and direct or indirect conflict continue to play a role in the analysis. <i>Shady Grove</i> uses the language of \"potential conflict,\" \"compatible\" and \"collision with state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1440-42 (majority opinion). The plurality also characterizes the first step of the analysis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> as \"determining whether the federal and state rules can be reconciled (because they answer different questions)\". <i>Id.</i> at 1445 (plurality opinion); <i>see also id.</i> at 1451 (Stevens, J., concurring) (stating the first step of the analysis asks whether the federal rule leaves \"no room for the operation of seemingly conflicting state law.\"). Our own case law also provides guidance. <i>See </i><i>Morel v. DaimlerChrysler AG,</i> 565 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.2009) (asking whether the state rule is \"inconsistent\"); <i>Gil de Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ass'ns, Inc.,</i> 137 F.3d 56, 65 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (asking about \"potential conflict\"). And we give the federal rules a literal reading. <i>See </i><i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 750 n. 9, 100 S.Ct. 1978.</p>\n<p>We also take some guidance from history. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1, which governs shareholder derivative suits, is not so broad as to cover some state bond requirements for such suits. <i>Cohen,</i> 337 U.S. at 555-57, 69 S.Ct. 1221. But the class action Rule 23 is broad enough to preclude state prohibitions on certain class actions seeking penalties or statutory minimum damages. <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1431. It is also commonly accepted that in diversity cases state statutes of limitations apply.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,</i> 326 U.S. 99, 110, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945). And Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), governing the relation back of complaints, displaces an inconsistent state rule. <i>Morel,</i> 565 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),<sup>[14]</sup> which governs motions to dismiss on the pleadings, and Fed. R.Civ.P. 56, which governs motions for summary judgment, are not so broad as to cover the issues within the scope of Section 556. To use the language of <i>Shady Grove,</i> Rules 12 and 56 do not \"attempt[] to answer the same question,\" <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1437, nor do they \"address the same subject,\" <i>id.</i> at 1440, as Section 556.</p>\n<p>Federal Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 are addressed to different (but related) subject-matters. Section 556 on its face is not addressed to either of these procedures, which are general federal procedures governing all categories of cases. Section 556 is only addressed to special procedures for state claims based on a defendant's petitioning activity. In contrast to the state statute in <i>Shady Grove,</i> Section 556 does not seek to displace the Federal Rules or have Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 cease to function. <i>Cf. </i><i>Morel,</i> 565 F.3d at 24. In addition, Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 do not purport to apply only to suits challenging the defendants' exercise of their constitutional petitioning rights. Maine itself has general procedural rules which are the equivalents of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 56. <i>See</i> Me. R. Civ. P. 12; Me. R. Civ. P. 56. That fact further supports the view that Maine has not created a substitute to the Federal Rules, but instead created a supplemental and substantive rule to provide added protections, beyond those in Rules 12 and 56, to defendants who are named as parties because of constitutional petitioning activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> Rule 12(b)(6) serves to provide a mechanism to test the sufficiency of the complaint. <i>See </i><i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Section 556, by contrast, provides a mechanism for a defendant to move to dismiss a claim on an entirely different basis: that the claims in question rest on the defendant's protected petitioning conduct and that the plaintiff cannot meet the special rules Maine has created to protect such petitioning activity against lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The federal summary judgment rule, Rule 56, creates a process for parties to secure judgment before trial on the basis that there are no disputed material issues of fact, and as a matter of law, one party is entitled to judgment. Inherent in Rule 56 is that a fact-finder's evaluation of material factual disputes is not required. But Section 556 serves the entirely distinct function of protecting those specific defendants that have been targeted with litigation on the basis of their protected speech. When applicable, Section 556 requires a court to consider whether the defendant's conduct had a reasonable basis in fact or law, and whether that conduct caused actual injury. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 cannot be said to control those issues.</p>\n<p>Section 556 has both substantive and procedural aspects. One of the substantive aspects of Section 556 shifts the burden to plaintiff to defeat the special motion. Section 556 also determines the scope of plaintiff's burden, requiring plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's activity \"(1) was without `reasonable factual support,' and (2) was without an `arguable basis in law.'\" <i>Schelling,</i> 942 A.2d at 1229 (quoting Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556). Further, Section 556 substantively alters the type of harm actionablethat is, plaintiff must show the defendant's conduct \"resulted in `actual injury' to the plaintiff.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556).<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 determines which party bears the burden of proof on a state-law created cause of action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Coll v. PB Diagnostic Syst., Inc.,</i> 50 F.3d 1115, 1121 (1st Cir.1995). And it is long settled that the allocation of burden of proof is substantive in nature and controlled by state law. <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> 318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943); <i>Am. Title Ins. Co. v. E.W. Fin. Corp.,</i> 959 F.2d 345, 348 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>Further, Section 556 provides substantive legal defenses to defendants and alters what plaintiffs must prove to prevail. It is not the province of either Rule 12 or Rule 56 to supply substantive defenses or the elements of plaintiffs' proof to causes of action, either state or federal.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Because Section 556 is \"so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right,\" it cannot be displaced by Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56. <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1452 (Stevens, J., concurring). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> Further, if Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 were thought to preempt application of all of Section 556, a serious question might be raised under the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> In light of our conclusion that Section 556 is not displaced, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p>Given that neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is so broad as to encompass the special Section 556 proceedings, we might go no further. We do acknowledge the district court's concern about some differences in the mechanics, particularly as to the record on which the motion is evaluated. Whether the procedures outlined in Section 556 will in fact depart from those of Rule 12 and Rule 56 will depend on the particulars in a given case of the claim and defense. Some Section 556 motions, like Rule 12(b)(6) motions,<sup>[17]</sup> will be resolved on the pleadings. In other cases, Section 556 will permit courts to look beyond the pleadings to affidavits and materials of record, as Rule 56 does. In this way, some Section 556 motions, depending on the particulars of a case, will be resolved just as summary judgment motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 are.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Godin emphasizes that Section 556 has the potential in a particular case to give the individual defendants a dispositive ruling without affording discovery, thus bringing Section 556 in conflict with Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. <i>Cf. </i><i>Metabolife,</i> 264 F.3d at 845-47. Godin has not shown any actual conflict. While Section 556 provides that discovery proceedings are stayed upon the filing of a special motion to dismiss, the statute also provides that a court may, upon good cause shown, order that specific discovery be conducted. Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. The Maine statute, in imposing on the opponent of the motion the burden of justifying discovery, is consistent with the allocation of burdens under Rule 56(d), formerly Rule 56(f).<sup>[19]</sup> If a federal court would allow discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> 56(d) then, in our view, that would constitute good cause under the Maine statute.</p>\n<p>The limiting effect that Section 556 has on discovery is not materially different from the effect of Rule 12 proceedings and, in some instances, Rule 56 proceedings. Neither Rule 12 nor Rule 56 of the federal rules of procedure purport to be so broad as to preclude additional mechanisms meant to curtail rights-dampening litigation through the modification of pleading standards. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737, is a federal version of such an additional mechanism to the Federal Rules, meant to apply to a discrete category of cases. \"Designed to curb perceived abuses of the § 10(b) private action,\" the PSLRA created a higher standard for pleading scienter in any § 10(b) claim.<sup>[20]</sup><i>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.,</i> 551 U.S. 308, 320, 321, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). We recognize that the fact that Congress may create special procedures in addition to those under the Federal Rules does not itself mean that the Federal Rules would not displace a similar state-law special procedure. <i>See </i><i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1438. Still, the existence of the PSLRA provides some support to our conclusion that Congress, in approving Rules 12 and 56, did not intend to preclude special rules designed to make it more difficult to bring certain types of actions where state law defines the cause of action.</p>\n<p>In sum, \"there is no indication that Rules ... 12 and 56 were intended to `occupy the field' with respect to pretrial procedures aimed at weeding out meritless claims.\" <i>Newsham,</i> 190 F.3d at 972; <i>see also </i><i>Henry,</i> 566 F.3d at 169-70 (enforcing Louisiana's anti-SLAPP statute in federal court). Rather, Rules 12 and 56 \"can exist side by side\" with Section 556, \"each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict.\" <i>Newsham,</i> 190 F.3d at 972 (quoting <i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 752, 100 S.Ct. 1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Declining to Apply Section 556 in Federal Court Would Disserve the Dual Aims of Erie</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Here, application of Section 556 would best serve the \"`twin aims of the <i>Erie</i> rule: discouragement of forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws.'\" <i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co.,</i> 41 F.3d 764, 773 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Stewart,</i> 487 U.S. at 27 n. 6, 108 S.Ct. 2239 (1988)). \"If application of federal law would disserve these two policies, state law applies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plainly, Section 556 substantively alters Maine-law claims that are based on a defendant's protected petitioning activity by shifting the burden to the plaintiff and altering the showing the plaintiff must make. Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. Section 556 also allows courts to award attorney's fees to prevailing defendants, and alters the traditional common-law rule that, in libel cases, a plaintiff need not demonstrate specific damages to recover on a claim, as alleging \"damages per se\" does not satisfy Section 556's actual injury standard. <i>See </i><i>Schelling,</i> 942 A.2d at 1232 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 569, cmt. b (1977)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> Declining to apply Section 556 in federal court would thus result in an inequitable administration of justice between a defense asserted in state court and the same defense asserted in federal court. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 41 F.3d at 773. Likewise, were Section 556 not to apply in federal court, the incentives for forum shopping would be strong: electing to bring state-law claims in federal as opposed to state court would allow a plaintiff to avoid Section 556's burden-shifting framework, rely upon the common law's per se damages rule, and circumvent any liability for a defendant's attorney's fees or costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Because neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is sufficiently broad to control the issues raised by the individual defendants' Section 556 special motion, we conclude the district court erred in denying the motion on the basis that Section 556 was displaced. Holding to the contrary would deprive the individual defendants of Section 556 protection solely on account of the fact that they are joined as defendants in this litigation with Machiasport and the Union, against whom federal claims are raised. Such an outcome would directly contravene <i>Erie</i>'s aims.</p>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> the district court's order, and <i>remand</i> so that the district court may consider the merits of the individual defendants' special motion to dismiss under Section 556 in the first instance. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Nicely offered statements to both the Superintendent of Schools and the School Board that she felt Godin's treatment of an eight-year-old child, which Nicely observed first hand, was \"inappropriate and abusive.\" Schencks reported to Maine's Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine State Police her observation of Godin's December 2007 treatment of a four-year-old child. Metta informed the Machiasport School Board that, on two occasions in January 2007, she observed Godin treat a student in a manner that in her view was abusive.</p>\n<p>[2]  Godin's other state claims include a breach of contract claim against the Union and Machiasport and a claim for punitive damages against all defendants.</p>\n<p>[3]  The federal Constitution provides: \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. Const. amend. I.\n</p>\n<p>The Maine Constitution provides: \"The people have a right at all times in an orderly and peaceable manner to assemble to consult upon the common good, to give instructions to their representatives, and to request, of either department of the government by petition or remonstrance, redress of their wrongs and grievances.\" Me. Const. art. 1, § 15.</p>\n<p>[4]  Section 1367(a) further provides that \"[s]uch supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). That § 1367(a) confers on federal courts jurisdiction over state-law claims against non-diverse partiesoften termed \"pendent party jurisdiction\"is particularly clear in light of that statute's origins. <i>See</i> 13D Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 3567, at 320-23 (3d ed. 2008) (describing § 1367's enactment as directly responsive to the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Finley v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 545, 109 S.Ct. 2003, 104 L.Ed.2d 593 (1989), that the Federal Tort Claims Act does not allow for the assertion of pendent jurisdiction over additional parties).</p>\n<p>[5]  Because the issue is one of whether there is subject-matter jurisdiction based on the pleadings, we reach this conclusion having accepted as true the well-pleaded facts of Godin's complaint and assessed them in the light most favorable to her theory of liability. <i>See </i><i>United States ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L.P.,</i> 579 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p>[6]  Because of the important public interests at stake, <i>Will v. Hallock,</i> 546 U.S. 345, 353, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006), contrary to Godin's arguments, reinforces our conclusion.</p>\n<p>[7]  The New Jersey statute at issue in <i>Cohen</i> made the plaintiff in a stockholder's derivative action \"liable for all expenses, including attorney's fees, of the defense\" and required \"security for their payment as a condition of prosecuting the action.\" <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 543, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p>[8]  Godin's reliance on <i>Englert</i> is thus misplaced. There, in dismissing the defendants' consolidated interlocutory appeals on the basis that an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion could be effectively reviewed after final judgment, the Ninth Circuit found it important that Oregon's anti-SLAPP statute did not itself make interlocutory appeals available in state-court proceedings. <i>Englert v. MacDonell,</i> 551 F.3d 1099, 1106-07 (9th Cir.2009). <i>Englert,</i> with its heavy reliance on the view of Oregon law regarding the availability of interlocutory appeals, cuts against Godin's position given the availability of such appeals in this context under Maine law.</p>\n<p>[9]  Our analysis regarding this pendent state-law claim proceeds as it would were this a state-law claim brought in federal court by virtue of diversity jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Doty v. Sewall,</i> 908 F.2d 1053, 1063 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[10]  We have held that a nominally procedural state rule authorizing an award of attorney's fees as a sanction for obstinate litigation is substantive for purposes of <i>Erie</i> analysis. <i>Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. Gen. Elec. Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 145 F.3d 463, 478 (1st Cir. 1998). State conflict of laws rules are also considered substantive. <i>Day &amp; Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner,</i> 423 U.S. 3, 4, 96 S.Ct. 167, 46 L.Ed.2d 3 (1975).</p>\n<p>[11]  This shift was described in our opinion in <i>Gil de Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ass'ns, Inc.,</i> 137 F.3d 56, 65 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998). One concern motivating the shift was the fact that it \"would make no sense for the supremacy of federal law to wane precisely because there is no state law directly on point.\" <i>Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.,</i> 487 U.S. 22, 26 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. 2239, 101 L.Ed.2d 22 (1988). Another concern may well be that the supremacy of the Federal Rules should not depend only on whether there is a direct conflict.</p>\n<p>[12]  The caveat exists because \"[t]he [Federal] Civil Rules cannot roam at will.\" <i>McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 1991). They must relate to practice or procedure, 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a), and may not \"abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b).</p>\n<p>[13]  As a consequence, state rules that are integral to the state statute of limitations usually apply in federal court; federal rules are not so broad as to cover these state rules. <i>See</i> 17A J. Moore et al., <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> § 124.03[2][a] (3d ed. 2009). For example, Fed.R.Civ.P. 3, which concerns commencing an action in federal court, is not broad enough to control state laws integral to the limitations issue. <i>See </i><i>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.,</i> 446 U.S. 740, 751-52, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980).</p>\n<p>[14]  Our analysis with regard to Rule 12(b)(6) applies with equal force to Rule 12(c), which Godin also asserts preempts Section 556. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c).</p>\n<p>[15]  In addition, Section 556 allows courts to award attorney's fees and costs to a defendant that successfully brings a special motion to dismiss, a statutory element we have previously determined to be substantive. <i>See </i><i>Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A.,</i> 145 F.3d at 478.</p>\n<p>[16]  The similarities between Section 556 and Rules 12 and 56 as mechanisms to efficiently dispose with meritless claims before trial occurs does not resolve the issue. Such an abstracted framing of the breadth of the Federal Rules is inappropriate. <i>See </i><i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1441 n. 7, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) (embracing the suggestion that Federal Rules should be read \"to avoid `substantial variations [in outcomes] between state and federal litigation'\") (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Semtek Int'l Inc., v. Lockheed Martin Corp.,</i> 531 U.S. 497, 504, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 149 L.Ed.2d 32 (2001)).</p>\n<p>[17]  Even in assessing 12(b)(6) motions, the scope of materials considered depends somewhat on the particular case. For example, courts can take account of materials outside the pleadings if they are undisputed matters of public record. <i>See </i><i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[18]  There may be a concern that Section 556, to the extent it might be read to allow, contrary to Rule 56, a judge to resolve a disputed material issue of fact, would then preclude a party from exercising its Seventh Amendment rights to trial by jury on disputed issues of material fact. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Eng'g Co.,</i> 243 U.S. 273, 278, 37 S.Ct. 283, 61 L.Ed. 715 (1917) (summary judgment does not violate Seventh Amendment). But Section 556 is a relatively young statute, not much construed by the state courts, and there is no reason to think the state courts would construe Section 556 so as to be incompatible with the Seventh Amendment. Although the Seventh Amendment has not been incorporated against the states, <i>Curtis v. Loether,</i> 415 U.S. 189, 192 n.6, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974), Maine's constitution itself provides that \"[i]n all civil suits, and in all controversies concerning property, the parties shall have a right to a trial by jury, except in cases where it has hertofore been otherwise practiced.\" Me. Const. art. I, § 20. This provision has \"historically been construed as guaranteeing the right to a trial by jury in civil cases unless it is demonstrated that such a right did not exist at the time of the adoption of [Maine's] Constitution.\" <i>Smith v. Hawthorne,</i> 892 A.2d 433, 444 (Me.2006).

This question, here as it applies to Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, is one of first impression for this court, and lies at the center of this appeal. We hold the Maine anti-SLAPP statute must be applied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Basic background facts set the stage. Shortly after Godin began working as a teacher and principal at the Fort O'Brien Elementary School in August 2006, Machiasport began receiving complaints from other employees concerning her conduct toward students, including complaints from the three individual defendants, Patty Schencks, Joleen Nicely, and Donna Metta.<sup>[1]</sup> Machiasport conducted an investigation of Godin's conduct in May 2008. The June 4, 2008 investigation report concluded that the allegations that Godin's conduct was abusive and inappropriate were not supported.</p>\n<p>Two days after the report was issued, Godin received notice from the Superintendent of Machiasport Schools that her employment contract, which would have expired in 2011, was being terminated due to budgetary constraints caused by \"significant subsidy loss.\" Godin was told that her position would be filled by a \"teaching principal,\" which occurred on August 12, 2008.</p>\n<p>On March 2, 2009, Godin brought suit in federal court, asserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Union and Machiasport, and a number of state claims, including claims against the individual defendants for interference with advantageous contractual relationships and defamation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The individual defendants filed a special motion to dismiss under Maine's anti-SLAPP <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> statute, which creates a special process by which a defendant may move to dismiss any claim that arises from the defendant's exercise of the right of petition under either the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine.<sup>[3]</sup> Me. Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556 (\"Section 556\"). Godin does not dispute that her claims against the individual defendants are based on conduct that falls within the statute's broad definition of \"a party's exercise of its right of petition.\" Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556.</p>\n<p>The statute provides that once a defendant brings such a \"special motion to dismiss\" and demonstrates that the claims in question are based on the defendant's petitioning activity, the court \"shall advance [the motion] so that it may be heard and determined with as little delay as possible.\" <i>Id.</i> The court shall grant the special motion \"unless the party against whom the special motion is made shows that the moving party's exercise of its right of petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and that the moving party's acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\" <i>Id.</i> In assessing whether to grant the special motion, \"the court shall consider the pleading and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\" <i>Id.</i> A court may order discovery specific to the Section 556 motion for good cause shown. <i>Id.</i> Evidence considered in reviewing a special motion to dismiss should be viewed \"in the light most favorable to the moving party because the responding party bears the burden of proof when the statute applies.\" <i>Morse Bros., Inc. v.

We hold on the facts here that we have appellate jurisdiction and that the district court erred in not applying Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. We reverse and remand for further proceedings, including proceedings under Section 556.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We address two preliminary jurisdictional issues: (1) whether federal subject-matter jurisdiction exists over the state-law claims against the non-diverse individual defendants even though no federal claim has been brought against them, and (2) whether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the individual defendants' interlocutory appeal by virtue of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> A. <i>Federal Subject-Matter Jurisdiction: The Supplemental Jurisdiction Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although the parties have not questioned subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims at issue, \"a court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction, and to proceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.\" <i>In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1002 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>In her complaint, Godin asserts federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 <i>et seq.</i> as to the claims against the school system, and that there exists a common nucleus of operative facts between the state claims and her federal claims sufficient to establish supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.</p>\n<p>With certain exceptions not applicable here, a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims \"that are so related to claims in the action within [a court's] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"<sup>[4]</sup> 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). While it might be questioned whether Godin's state-law claims that her job termination was caused by defamatory comments from the individual defendants arise out of the same transaction as her federal claim that the schools did not afford due process in reaching the termination decision, that is not the test. <i>See </i><i>Global NAPs, Inc. v.

We conclude it would not offend the Constitution to assert supplemental jurisdiction over Godin's state-law claims.<sup>[5]</sup> Accordingly, supplemental jurisdiction exists over Godin's state-law claims under § 1367(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Appellate Jurisdiction: The Collateral Order Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Godin objects that we lack appellate jurisdiction, arguing that the order denying application of Section 556 does not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine. \"The burden of establishing jurisdiction rests with the party who asserts its existence,\" here the three individual defendants. <i>Campbell v.

We defer to another day resolution of the question of whether an order addressed to the merits of a ruling under an anti-SLAPP statute is immediately appealable.</p>\n<p>We have appellate jurisdiction. First, the order conclusively decides that relief under Maine's Section 556 is unavailable to the individual defendants. The relevant inquiry for collateral order doctrine purposes is whether the order is conclusive as to \"the disputed question,\" not the action as a whole. <i>Will,</i> 546 U.S. at 349, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145689\"><a href=\"/opinion/145689/will-v-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The seminal Supreme Court case of <i>Cohen v. Beneficial</i><i> Industrial Loan Corporation</i> itself involved an interlocutory appeal from a district court's determination that a state statute was not applicable to a state-law claim brought in federal court.<sup>[7]</sup> 337 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> at 546, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Likewise, the parallel question of whether this state anti-SLAPP statute applies to a state-law claim brought in federal court qualifies as \"too important to be denied review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the order appealed from would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. It is relevant, but not conclusive, that the Maine Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 556 has led it to permit interlocutory appeals of orders denying special motions to dismiss in its own courts, because \"a failure to grant review of these decisions at this stage would impose additional litigation costs on defendants, the very harm the statute seeks to avoid, and would result in a loss of defendants' substantial rights.\" <i>Schelling v.

The question presented was whether a New York Rule, N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 901(b), which prevents parties from bringing class action lawsuits on claims seeking the minimum measure of recovery imposed by statute, was preempted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 in diversity cases. Writing for a five member majority, Justice Scalia concluded that, because § 901(b) \"attempts to answer the same question\" as Rule 23, namely, the categorical question of when a class action may be brought, § 901(b) could not be applied to bar class actions in federal diversity cases, so long as Rule 23 complies with the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> at 1437.</p>\n<p>Joined only by three other Justices, Justice Scalia went on to reason that Rule 23's validity under the Rules Enabling Act depends entirely on whether it \"really regulate[s] procedure,\" which he concluded it did. <i>Id.</i> at 1442 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103433\"><a href=\"/opinion/103433/sibbach-v-wilson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103433\"><a href=\"/opinion/103433/sibbach-v-wilson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This conclusion was reached without any inquiry into whether § 901(b) was procedural or substantive, as in his view that question \"makes no difference\" for Rules Enabling Act purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 1444.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens joined the Court's narrow holding that Rule 23 was sufficiently broad to preempt § 901(b), and that Rule 23 complied with the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> at 1448 (Stevens, J., concurring). But in a concurring opinion, joined in relevant part by four other Justices, he held that whether a Federal Rule is valid under the Rules Enabling Act depends not on the Federal Rule alone, but also on the nature of the state rule it seeks to displace. <i>Id.</i> at 1452-53. The critical question is not \"whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is traditionally described as substantive or procedural,\" but rather \"whether the state law actually is part of a State's framework of substantive rights or remedies.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1449. Justice Stevens also noted that this inquiry under the Rules Enabling Act \"may well bleed back\" into the inquiry of whether a Federal Rule is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court. <i>Id.</i> at 1452. This is so because a Federal Rule \"cannot govern a particular case in which the rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right.\" <i>Id.</i> To avoid such a result, the concurrence concludes, \"[w]hen a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's fractured holding regarding when a Federal Rule is \"sufficiently broad\" to control an issue of state law is given content by other language used by the Court. The concepts of congruence, co-extensiveness, difference, and direct or indirect conflict continue to play a role in the analysis. <i>Shady Grove</i> uses the language of \"potential conflict,\" \"compatible\" and \"collision with state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1440-42 (majority opinion). The plurality also characterizes the first step of the analysis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> as \"determining whether the federal and state rules can be reconciled (because they answer different questions)\". <i>Id.</i> at 1445 (plurality opinion); <i>see also id.</i> at 1451 (Stevens, J., concurring) (stating the first step of the analysis asks whether the federal rule leaves \"no room for the operation of seemingly conflicting state law.\"). Our own case law also provides guidance. <i>See </i><i>Morel v. DaimlerChrysler AG,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203807\"><a href=\"/opinion/203807/morel-v-daimlerchrysler-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2009) (asking whether the state rule is \"inconsistent\"); <i>Gil de Rebollo v.

And we give the federal rules a literal reading. <i>See </i><i>Walker,</i> 446 U.S. at 750 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1978</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We also take some guidance from history. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1, which governs shareholder derivative suits, is not so broad as to cover some state bond requirements for such suits. <i>Cohen,</i> 337 U.S. at 555-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>. But the class action Rule 23 is broad enough to preclude state prohibitions on certain class actions seeking penalties or statutory minimum damages. <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1431. It is also commonly accepted that in diversity cases state statutes of limitations apply.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116658/guaranty-trust-co-v-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116658/guaranty-trust-co-v-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2079</span></a></span> (1945). And Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), governing the relation back of complaints, displaces an inconsistent state rule. <i>Morel,</i> 565 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),<sup>[14]</sup> which governs motions to dismiss on the pleadings, and Fed. R.Civ.P. 56, which governs motions for summary judgment, are not so broad as to cover the issues within the scope of Section 556. To use the language of <i>Shady Grove,</i> Rules 12 and 56 do not \"attempt[] to answer the same question,\" <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1437, nor do they \"address the same subject,\" <i>id.</i> at 1440, as Section 556.</p>\n<p>Federal Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 are addressed to different (but related) subject-matters. Section 556 on its face is not addressed to either of these procedures, which are general federal procedures governing all categories of cases. Section 556 is only addressed to special procedures for state claims based on a defendant's petitioning activity. In contrast to the state statute in <i>Shady Grove,</i> Section 556 does not seek to displace the Federal Rules or have Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 cease to function. <i>Cf. </i><i>Morel,</i> 565 F.3d at 24. In addition, Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 do not purport to apply only to suits challenging the defendants' exercise of their constitutional petitioning rights. Maine itself has general procedural rules which are the equivalents of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 56. <i>See</i> Me. R. Civ. P. 12; Me. R. Civ. P. 56. That fact further supports the view that Maine has not created a substitute to the Federal Rules, but instead created a supplemental and substantive rule to provide added protections, beyond those in Rules 12 and 56, to defendants who are named as parties because of constitutional petitioning activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> Rule 12(b)(6) serves to provide a mechanism to test the sufficiency of the complaint. <i>See </i><i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span> (2009). Section 556, by contrast, provides a mechanism for a defendant to move to dismiss a claim on an entirely different basis: that the claims in question rest on the defendant's protected petitioning conduct and that the plaintiff cannot meet the special rules Maine has created to protect such petitioning activity against lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The federal summary judgment rule, Rule 56, creates a process for parties to secure judgment before trial on the basis that there are no disputed material issues of fact, and as a matter of law, one party is entitled to judgment. Inherent in Rule 56 is that a fact-finder's evaluation of material factual disputes is not required. But Section 556 serves the entirely distinct function of protecting those specific defendants that have been targeted with litigation on the basis of their protected speech. When applicable, Section 556 requires a court to consider whether the defendant's conduct had a reasonable basis in fact or law, and whether that conduct caused actual injury. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 cannot be said to control those issues.</p>\n<p>Section 556 has both substantive and procedural aspects. One of the substantive aspects of Section 556 shifts the burden to plaintiff to defeat the special motion. Section 556 also determines the scope of plaintiff's burden, requiring plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's activity \"(1) was without `reasonable factual support,' and (2) was without an `arguable basis in law.'\" <i>Schelling,</i> 942 A.2d at 1229 (quoting Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556). Further, Section 556 substantively alters the type of harm actionablethat is, plaintiff must show the defendant's conduct \"resulted in `actual injury' to the plaintiff.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556).<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 determines which party bears the burden of proof on a state-law created cause of action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Coll v. PB Diagnostic Syst., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195995\"><a href=\"/opinion/195995/coll-v-pb-diagnostics/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1121 (1st Cir.1995). And it is long settled that the allocation of burden of proof is substantive in nature and controlled by state law. <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103772\"><a href=\"/opinion/103772/palmer-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 117, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103772\"><a href=\"/opinion/103772/palmer-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is not the province of either Rule 12 or Rule 56 to supply substantive defenses or the elements of plaintiffs' proof to causes of action, either state or federal.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Because Section 556 is \"so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right,\" it cannot be displaced by Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56. <i>Shady Grove,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1452 (Stevens, J., concurring). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> Further, if Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 were thought to preempt application of all of Section 556, a serious question might be raised under the Rules Enabling Act. <i>Id.</i> In light of our conclusion that Section 556 is not displaced, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p>Given that neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is so broad as to encompass the special Section 556 proceedings, we might go no further. We do acknowledge the district court's concern about some differences in the mechanics, particularly as to the record on which the motion is evaluated. Whether the procedures outlined in Section 556 will in fact depart from those of Rule 12 and Rule 56 will depend on the particulars in a given case of the claim and defense. Some Section 556 motions, like Rule 12(b)(6) motions,<sup>[17]</sup> will be resolved on the pleadings. In other cases, Section 556 will permit courts to look beyond the pleadings to affidavits and materials of record, as Rule 56 does. In this way, some Section 556 motions, depending on the particulars of a case, will be resolved just as summary judgment motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 are.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Godin emphasizes that Section 556 has the potential in a particular case to give the individual defendants a dispositive ruling without affording discovery, thus bringing Section 556 in conflict with Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. <i>Cf. </i><i>Metabolife,</i> 264 F.3d at 845-47. Godin has not shown any actual conflict. While Section 556 provides that discovery proceedings are stayed upon the filing of a special motion to dismiss, the statute also provides that a court may, upon good cause shown, order that specific discovery be conducted. Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. The Maine statute, in imposing on the opponent of the motion the burden of justifying discovery, is consistent with the allocation of burdens under Rule 56(d), formerly Rule 56(f).<sup>[19]</sup> If a federal court would allow discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> 56(d) then, in our view, that would constitute good cause under the Maine statute.</p>\n<p>The limiting effect that Section 556 has on discovery is not materially different from the effect of Rule 12 proceedings and, in some instances, Rule 56 proceedings. Neither Rule 12 nor Rule 56 of the federal rules of procedure purport to be so broad as to preclude additional mechanisms meant to curtail rights-dampening litigation through the modification of pleading standards.

No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737, is a federal version of such an additional mechanism to the Federal Rules, meant to apply to a discrete category of cases. \"Designed to curb perceived abuses of the § 10(b) private action,\" the PSLRA created a higher standard for pleading scienter in any § 10(b) claim.<sup>[20]</sup><i>Tellabs, Inc. v.

Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 14, § 556. Section 556 also allows courts to award attorney's fees to prevailing defendants, and alters the traditional common-law rule that, in libel cases, a plaintiff need not demonstrate specific damages to recover on a claim, as alleging \"damages per se\" does not satisfy Section 556's actual injury standard. <i>See </i><i>Schelling,</i> 942 A.2d at 1232 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 569, cmt. b (1977)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> Declining to apply Section 556 in federal court would thus result in an inequitable administration of justice between a defense asserted in state court and the same defense asserted in federal court. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 41 F.3d at 773. Likewise, were Section 556 not to apply in federal court, the incentives for forum shopping would be strong: electing to bring state-law claims in federal as opposed to state court would allow a plaintiff to avoid Section 556's burden-shifting framework, rely upon the common law's per se damages rule, and circumvent any liability for a defendant's attorney's fees or costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Because neither Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is sufficiently broad to control the issues raised by the individual defendants' Section 556 special motion, we conclude the district court erred in denying the motion on the basis that Section 556 was displaced. Holding to the contrary would deprive the individual defendants of Section 556 protection solely on account of the fact that they are joined as defendants in this litigation with Machiasport and the Union, against whom federal claims are raised. Such an outcome would directly contravene <i>Erie</i>'s aims.</p>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> the district court's order, and <i>remand</i> so that the district court may consider the merits of the individual defendants' special motion to dismiss under Section 556 in the first instance. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Nicely offered statements to both the Superintendent of Schools and the School Board that she felt Godin's treatment of an eight-year-old child, which Nicely observed first hand, was \"inappropriate and abusive.\" Schencks reported to Maine's Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine State Police her observation of Godin's December 2007 treatment of a four-year-old child. Metta informed the Machiasport School Board that, on two occasions in January 2007, she observed Godin treat a student in a manner that in her view was abusive.</p>\n<p>[2]  Godin's other state claims include a breach of contract claim against the Union and Machiasport and a claim for punitive damages against all defendants.</p>\n<p>[3]  The federal Constitution provides: \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. Const. amend. I.\n</p>\n<p>The Maine Constitution provides: \"The people have a right at all times in an orderly and peaceable manner to assemble to consult upon the common good, to give instructions to their representatives, and to request, of either department of the government by petition or remonstrance, redress of their wrongs and grievances.\" Me. Const. art. 1, § 15.</p>\n<p>[4]  Section 1367(a) further provides that \"[s]uch supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). That § 1367(a) confers on federal courts jurisdiction over state-law claims against non-diverse partiesoften termed \"pendent party jurisdiction\"is particularly clear in light of that statute's origins. <i>See</i> 13D Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 3567, at 320-23 (3d ed. 2008) (describing § 1367's enactment as directly responsive to the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Finley v.

There, in dismissing the defendants' consolidated interlocutory appeals on the basis that an order denying an anti-SLAPP motion could be effectively reviewed after final judgment, the Ninth Circuit found it important that Oregon's anti-SLAPP statute did not itself make interlocutory appeals available in state-court proceedings. <i>Englert v.

One concern motivating the shift was the fact that it \"would make no sense for the supremacy of federal law to wane precisely because there is no state law directly on point.\" <i>Stewart Org., Inc. v.

Another concern may well be that the supremacy of the Federal Rules should not depend only on whether there is a direct conflict.</p>\n<p>[12]  The caveat exists because \"[t]he [Federal] Civil Rules cannot roam at will.\" <i>McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 1991). They must relate to practice or procedure, 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a), and may not \"abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b).</p>\n<p>[13]  As a consequence, state rules that are integral to the state statute of limitations usually apply in federal court; federal rules are not so broad as to cover these state rules. <i>See</i> 17A J. Moore et al., <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> § 124.03[2][a] (3d ed. 2009). For example, Fed.R.Civ.P. 3, which concerns commencing an action in federal court, is not broad enough to control state laws integral to the limitations issue. <i>See </i><i>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 751-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span> (1980).</p>\n<p>[14]  Our analysis with regard to Rule 12(b)(6) applies with equal force to Rule 12(c), which Godin also asserts preempts Section 556. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c).</p>\n<p>[15]  In addition, Section 556 allows courts to award attorney's fees and costs to a defendant that successfully brings a special motion to dismiss, a statutory element we have previously determined to be substantive. <i>See </i><i>Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A.,</i> 145 F.3d at 478.</p>\n<p>[16]  The similarities between Section 556 and Rules 12 and 56 as mechanisms to efficiently dispose with meritless claims before trial occurs does not resolve the issue. Such an abstracted framing of the breadth of the Federal Rules is inappropriate. <i>See </i><i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins.

For example, courts can take account of materials outside the pleadings if they are undisputed matters of public record. <i>See </i><i>In re Colonial Mortg.
