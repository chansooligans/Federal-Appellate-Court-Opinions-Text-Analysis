Angel   Luis  Morales                                                    \n\nCartagena  and Wilfredo Alvarado  Ortiz were convicted  along with co-\n\ndefendants Luis Alfredo  Alvarado and Juan Eugenio  Lorenzi Padilla of\n\naiding  and  abetting  in  the  unlawful  possession  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute  approximately 267  kilograms  of cocaine  aboard a  United\n\nStates vessel, 46  U.S.C.   1903(c)(1)(D) and (f), 18  U.S.C.   2, and\n\naiding and abetting  in the  importation of cocaine  into the  customs\n\nterritory of the United States, 21 U.S.C.   952(a), 18 U.S.C.   2.  On\n\nappeal, Morales  and Alvarado  ask us  to  reverse their  convictions,\n\nalleging an  insufficiency of evidence,  erroneous jury  instructions,\n\nand prosecutorial misconduct.  We affirm the convictions.\n\n                                  I.                                          I.\n\n         A. Sufficiency of the Evidence                                               \n\n         Appellants assert that as there was insufficient evidence  of\n\ncriminal  intent, the  district  court erroneously  denied their  Rule\n\n29(a) motions  for judgment  of acquittal.    In reviewing  a properly\n\npreserved Rule 29 motion,  we examine the evidence and  all legitimate\n\ninferences  therefrom in the light most favorable to the government to\n\ndetermine  whether a  rational jury  could have  found guilt  beyond a\n\nreasonable  doubt.  E.g.,  United States v.  Gonzalez-Torres, 980 F.2d                                                                    \n\n788, 790  (1st Cir. 1992);  United States v.  Clotida, 892 F.2d  1098,                                                             \n\n1103 (1st Cir. 1989).  \n\n         The government  argues that appellants  waived their Rule  29\n\nmotions  by presenting  evidence  after the  government concluded  its\n\ncase-in-chief and by failing to renew the motions at the  close of the\n\n                                 -2-\n\nevidence.   Were this so, our  review would be for  plain error only.1\n\nE.g.,  United States v. Alfredo Alvarado, Nos. 91-2075, 2076, slip op.                                                \n\nat 6 (1st Cir. Dec. 31,  1992); United States v. Arango-Echeberry, 927                                                                         \n\nF.2d 35, 37 (1st  Cir. 1991); Clotida, 892 F.2d at 1103.   However, we                                             \n\nneed not decide whether appellants waived their Rule 29 motions.  Even\n\nassuming they did not, the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury\n\nto find that appellants were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n         Appellants urge  that  \"mere presence\"  at the  scene is  not\n\nenough to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting in the commission\n\nof a  crime.   E.g.,  Clotida, 892  F.2d  at 1104.    They assert  the                                     \n\nevidence merely showed that they  were present on a vessel in  an area\n\nof the open  sea where an  air drop  of bales of  cocaine took  place.\n\nThey  analogize their conviction to  that of innocent  crew members on\n\nboard a sailboat  taking part  in the Grand  Regatta Columbus2  solely\n\nbecause  crew members in another  sailboat in the  regatta committed a\n\ncrime.  Appellants' analogy does not wash.  \n\n                                                \n\n1.    We upheld the convictions of co-defendants Luis Alfredo Alvarado\nand  Juan  Eugenio   Lorenzi  Padilla  against  a   challenge  to  the\nsufficiency  of  the evidence  under the  plain  error standard.   See                                                                              \nUnited States v. Alfredo Alvarado, Nos. 91-2075, 2076, slip op. at 5-7                                         \n(1st  Cir. Dec. 31, 1992).   The opinion in that  case contains a more\nexhaustive  account than  we provide  here of  the relevant  facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the convictions  of appellants and their co-\ndefendants.\n\n2.      The Grand  Regatta Columbus  was  a celebration  of  the 500th\nanniversary of  Columbus' discovery  of America  in which  hundreds of\nvessels  from dozens of  nations took part  in a  five-month race from\nEurope to America and  back in the  spring and summer  of 1992.   M.E.\nMalone,  CADIZ  to Boston;  Grand  regatta  pays  homage to  Columbus'                                                                              \nvoyage, Boston Globe, July 5, 1992.              \n\n                                 -3-\n\n         Rather  than  being aboard  only one  of hundreds  of vessels\n\ntaking part in a regatta,  appellants were in one of two  vessels over\n\nwhich a suspect  aircraft was seen to hover.   Flying at night without\n\nlights and with no flight plan, the aircraft made tight  circles about\n\n300  to  500 feet  above the  two vessels.    A Customs  Service pilot\n\nfollowing the suspect aircraft testified to having seen  moving lights\n\nfrom the  vessels.  From this  a reasonable jury could  infer that the\n\nvessels wished to be visible  to the aircraft.  Bales of  cocaine were\n\ndropped in proximity to the vessels from the aircraft, after which the\n\nvessels began heading  north towards the  shore with their  navigation\n\nlights turned  off.  At  first the  two boats traveled  together at  a\n\ndistance of about  100 yards.  After the second vessel veered off in a\n\nwesterly direction, a  police helicopter was  directed over the  first\n\nvessel,  occupied by  the  appellants.   The  helicopter was  lit  and\n\nidentified  as a police helicopter  by the letters  \"FURA,\" which were\n\ntwelve  to  sixteen  inches  long.    A  police  sergeant  aboard  the\n\nhelicopter  gestured for appellants  to stop.   Appellants  looked up,\n\nreduced  speed, and  then accelerated.   When  a police  marine vessel\n\nsubsequently approached,  appellants' vessel  veered off in  order, it\n\nmight  be  inferred,  to get  away.    While  other explanations  were\n\noffered,  a jury  could  reasonably conclude  from  this conduct  that\n\nappellants were  conscious of having engaged in  criminal activity and\n\nwere  more than mere inadvertent bystanders  at the drug drop.  United                                                                              \n\nStates v.  Lopez, 944 F.2d  33, 40 (1st  Cir. 1991); United  States v.                                                                           \n\nHernandez-Bermudez,  857 F.2d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v.                                                                           \n\n                                 -4-\n\nFlores Perez, 849 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Alvarez,                                                                             \n\n626 F.2d 208, 210 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n         The fishing  gear found  aboard both vessels  was wrapped  up\n\nand  not prepared for fishing.   No bait or fish  were found on either\n\nvessel.   No  fishing nets were  found in  the area.   As  fishing was\n\napparently not their purpose, the jury could infer that appellants had\n\nanother purpose for  their nighttime sojourn on the  sea.  Although no\n\ncocaine  was found aboard  appellants' vessel,  four bales  of cocaine\n\nwere discovered on the companion vessel.  A connection between the two\n\nvessels  was suggested not only by their proximity when first seen but\n\nby  evidence that appellant Wilfredo Alvarado Ortiz was related to co-\n\ndefendant  Luis Alfredo  Alvarado.   \"While innocent  association with\n\nthose involved in illegal activities can never form the sole basis for\n\na conviction, . . .  the existence of  a close relationship  between a\n\ndefendant and  others involved in criminal activity  can, as part of a\n\nlarger  package  of  proof,  assist  in  supporting  an  inference  of\n\ninvolvement  in illicit activity.\"   United States v.  Ortiz, 966 F.2d                                                                    \n\n707, 713  (1st Cir. 1992) (citing  Nye &amp; Nissen v.  United States, 336                                                                         \n\nU.S. 613, 619 (1949)), cert. denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3479 (1993).                                            \n\n         Criminal   intent   may,  of   course,   be   inferred   from\n\ncircumstantial evidence.  E.g., United States v. Gomez-Villamizar, No.                                                                         \n\n92-1228, slip op.  at 9 (1st Cir. Dec.  23, 1992); Ortiz, 966  F.2d at                                                                \n\n711; United States v. Rodriguez- Alvarado, 952 F.2d 586, 590 (1st Cir.                                                 \n\n1991).   Here, numerous factors, including  the unlighted, clandestine\n\nairplane  maneuvering over the two  boats, the lights  on the vessels,\n\n                                 -5-\n\ntheir proximity to the cocaine when dropped, the fact that appellants'\n\nvessel was running without navigational lights, the finding of cocaine\n\nbales on the companion vessel, and the lack of support for their being\n\nengaged  in fishing  or  some other  innocent occupation,  constituted\n\nsubstantial evidence  from which  a jury  could infer  that appellants\n\npossessed  the requisite criminal intent.   See Alfredo Alvarado, Nos.                                                                        \n\n2075, 2076, slip op. at 6-7 (1st Cir. Dec. 31, 1992).\n\n         B. Jury Instructions                                     \n\n         Appellants contend  that the district court's instructions to\n\nthe  jury  were  erroneous,  misleading,  and  created   impermissible\n\nmandatory presumptions of  guilt.  Pointing to isolated  excerpts from\n\nassorted instructions  regarding intent to distribute, possession, and\n\naiding  and abetting, appellants complain that the jury was allowed to\n\nconvict appellants  for merely being  present at  the scene of  a drug\n\ndrop.  \n\n         We review  a  district court's  charge  as  a whole,  not  in\n\nisolated excerpts.   E.g., United States v.  Hallock, 941 F.2d 36,  42                                                            \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991);  United States  v.  Boylan, 898  F.2d 230,  244 (1st                                                    \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 111  S. Ct. 139 (1990); United States v. Cintolo,                                                                             \n\n818  F.2d 980, 1003  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  484 U.S.  913 (1987).                                                      \n\nViewing the charge  in this manner, appellants'  arguments have little\n\nforce.    For  example,  appellants  object  to  the  district court's\n\ndefinition  of possession  with intent  to distribute.   The  district\n\ncourt  defined this element as  possessing \"with intent  to deliver or\n\ntransfer  possession of a controlled  substance to another person with                                                                              \n\n                                 -6-\n\nor without any financial interest in the transaction.\"  We see nothing                                                            \n\nwrong  in this.  See Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases), Fifth                            \n\nCircuit, Instruction  45, at  III-73 (1991); Federal  Judicial Center,\n\nPattern Criminal  Jury Instructions  (1987), Instruction 112,  at 147.\n\nAppellants contend that the instruction would permit a jury to convict\n\nappellants  and  their co-defendants  for  delivering  cocaine to  the\n\npolice.   This argument, however,  ignores the fact  that the district\n\ncourt  clearly  and correctly  defined  the  elements of  willfulness,\n\nintent, and knowledge elsewhere in the charge.  Considering the charge\n\nas  a whole,  we find  nothing that  would cause  the jury  to convict\n\nappellants without finding the requisite criminal intent. \n\n         Appellants  make  a  similar  argument  as  to  the  district\n\ncourt's  definition   of  constructive   possession.     According  to\n\nappellants,  the  definition  was   misleading  because  the  required\n\nintentional  aspects  were  only  vaguely   and  ambiguously  defined.\n\nBecause  appellants failed  to make  this objection  to the  charge at\n\ntrial, we  will reverse only upon  a showing of \"plain  error.\"  E.g.,                                                                             \n\nUnited States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 122 (1st Cir. 1990); United                                                                              \n\nStates v. Nazzaro, 889 F.2d 1158, 1166 (1st Cir. 1989);  Fed. R. Crim.                         \n\nP.  30.  Appellants  have not shown  plain error.   The district court\n\ndefined constructive  possession as \"knowingly [having]  the power and                                                      \n\nthe intention, at a given time, to exercise dominion or control over a                     \n\nthing,  either directly or through  another person or  persons.\"  This\n\ndefinition,  which  clearly required  both  knowledge  and intent,  is\n\nsimilar to one we have approved in the past.  See, e.g., United States                                                                              \n\n                                 -7-\n\nv.

Feb. 2,                                \n\n1993); United States v.  Ocampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406, 1409  (1st Cir.                                              \n\n1992).   Moreover, as already  noted, the district  court elsewhere in\n\nits  charge made  clear that,  to convict  appellants of  the offenses\n\ncharged,  the  jury  had  to  find  that  appellants acted  knowingly,\n\nintentionally,  and  willfully.     See  Hallock,   941  F.2d  at   42                                                        \n\n(constructive possession instruction without any  mention of knowledge\n\nor intent  is  not plain  error if  knowledge and  intent are  defined\n\nelsewhere in jury instructions).  We see no instructional error, plain\n\nor  otherwise,  that could  have  confused  the  jury into  convicting\n\nappellants without finding the requisite criminal intent.\n\n         Appellants  additionally contend  that  the  district court's\n\nopening remarks  to the  jury on  the concept  of aiding  and abetting\n\ncreated an impermissible mandatory presumption.  During these remarks,\n\nthe district court stated  that \"[a]iding and abetting means  when two\n\nor more persons assist each other, basically,  in the commission of an\n\noffense,  . .  . all of  them are  presumed to be  responsible for the\n\nwhole  acts committed together.\"  This statement, while not a complete\n\nexplanation  of the concept  of aiding and abetting,  did not create a\n\nmandatory  presumption of guilt.   Instead, it merely  explained, in a\n\npreliminary fashion, that  aiding and abetting is a form  of agency in\n\nwhich  the law holds a  defendant criminally responsible  for the acts\n\nand conduct of another person  even though the defendant may  not have\n\npersonally  committed every act constituting  the offense alleged.  Of\n\n                                 -8-\n\ncourse,  before a defendant may  be held criminally  responsible as an\n\naider  and  abettor, the  government  must  prove  that the  defendant\n\n\"associated himself with the underlying venture, participated in it as\n\nsomething he wished to bring about, and sought by his  actions to make\n\nit succeed.\"  United States  v. Clifford, 979 F.2d 896, 899  (1st Cir.                                                \n\n1992); United States v.  O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1020 (1st  Cir. 1992)                                        \n\n(\"In  order for aiding and abetting liability  to be applicable, . . .\n\nthe evidence  must establish  that the defendant  knowingly, willfully\n\nand  intentionally  sought  by his  action  or  presence  to make  the\n\nprincipal's criminal  transaction succeed.\").  The  district court, in\n\nits  subsequent charge, accurately instructed the jury in this regard.\n\nWe find  no error in  the district court's  instruction on  aiding and\n\nabetting  or  in any  of the  other  instructions to  which appellants\n\nobject.3\n\n         C. Prosecutorial Misconduct                                            \n\n         Appellants'  final  assertion  of   error  involves   alleged\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct.   Appellants  complain that  the prosecutor\n\nmisstated  the evidence during argument  of the Rule  29 motion before\n\nthe  trial  judge4   and  during  closing   argument  to  the   jury.5\n\n                                                \n\n3.    Appellants did not object  to the district court's definition of\nimportation,  which we  held, in  their co-defendants'  appeal,  to be\nerror, but not plain error.  See Alfredo Alvarado, Nos. 91-2075, 2076,                                                         \nslip op. at 9-11 (1st Cir. Dec. 31, 1992).\n\n4.    Since  the jury was not present during  the prosecutor's Rule 29\nargument,  appellants cannot  claim  that any  part  of that  argument\nimproperly  influenced the  jury.   The statements  made to  the judge\nalone were,  for the most part,  fully supported by the  record.  Only\none seems unsupported.   That involved whether appellants'  vessel was\nstationary  when the FURA helicopter  first approached.   We find this\n\n                                 -9-\n\nAppellants' arguments are severely  hampered by their failure  to have\n\nmade  contemporaneous objections to  the allegedly  offensive remarks.\n\nAbsence of objection to a prosecutor's remarks limits appellate review\n\nto  the plain error standard.   E.g., United  States v. Panet-Collazo,                                                                             \n\n960  F.2d 256, 260  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied sub nom.  Diaz v.

This standard is not an easy\n\none to meet.

Appellants  also  contend  that   the  prosecutor's  improper\nintroduction of hearsay evidence constituted prosecutorial misconduct.\nAppellants complain  specifically of the testimony  of Customs Service\nradar operator Richard Cunnicelli  that he saw flashing lights  in the\nwater as the suspect  aircraft approached the two vessels.   On cross-\nexamination, Cunnicelli  admitted that he never  actually saw anything\nin the  water because his  eyes were  focused on the  radar equipment.\nInstead, he heard  the pilot say,  \"I see  lights.\"  Appellants  argue\nthat they were prevented from  effectively objecting to this testimony\nby  the prosecutor's failure  to provide  Cunnicelli's rough  notes to\nappellants during  discovery.   Unlike  their co-defendants,  however,\nappellants never requested  these notes;  nor did they  object to  the\nadmission of  this testimony at trial; nor did they move to strike the\nhearsay testimony.  We are therefore  foreclosed from considering this\nissue on appeal  absent plain  error, which appellants  are unable  to\nestablish.   See United  States v. Serrano,  870 F.2d 1,  11 n.11 (1st                                                  \nCir. 1989).\n\n                                 -10-\n\nstandard, we will reverse  a conviction only \"'in  those circumstances\n\nin  which a miscarriage of  justice would otherwise  result.'\"  United                                                                              \n\nStates  v.

Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)).                              \n\n         In determining  whether a prosecutor's misstatements amounted\n\nto  plain error,  we  consider the  prosecutor's  comments within  the\n\nframework and context of the entire case.  Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d                                                                    \n\nat  1154; Santana-Camacho, 833 F.2d  at 373; United  States v.

Within  that context,  we must\n\ndecide  \"whether the offending conduct  so poisoned the  well that the\n\ntrial's  outcome was likely affected.\"  Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274.                                                            \n\nWe are  guided in making  this determination by  a number  of factors,\n\nincluding  the  frequency  and   deliberateness  of  the  prosecutor's\n\ncomments, the strength and clarity  of the trial judge's instructions,\n\nand  the strength  of  the government's  case  against the  defendant.\n\nUnited  States v.

Suffice it to say that we have carefully\n\nscrutinized   the  record  and  find  that  most  of  these  so-called\n\nmisstatements involve controverted facts or reasonable inferences that\n\nthe  prosecutor asked  the jury  to draw  from the  facts.   There was\n\nnothing improper in either instance.  See United States  v. Mount, 896                                                                         \n\nF.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir. 1990);  United States v.

During closing argument, the prosecutor\n\ndiscussed appellants' attempt to evade apprehension:\n\n              It  is only  as they are  about to  get caught\n         that all  of a  sudden one  vessel  starts to  veer\n         away.\n              Which   vessel?    How  interesting  that  the\n         defendant [Alfredo Alvarado] says,  the one that is\n         the lightest.  That is the one that went off.  That\n         is the one that took off.  That was the  decoy.  It\n         could get away quicker.\n              And sure enough,  the FURA helicopter in  fact\n         went after  the vessel that appeared  to be getting\n         away.\n\nTo  the  extent that  these  remarks suggest  that  appellants' vessel\n\nveered away, i.e., changed its course  from north to west, the remarks\n\nwere misleading.  It was the co-defendants' vessel that  veered off in\n\na westerly direction, not appellants' vessel.  Nevertheless, the  FURA\n\nhelicopter initially pursued appellants'  vessel, which apparently was\n\nlighter and could get away quicker.\n\n         The  above-quoted comments  did not  amount to  plain  error.\n\nThey were isolated and,  in relation to the body of  evidence received\n\nduring trial,  relatively insignificant.  The jury had heard testimony\n\nfrom a number  of government witnesses  that appellants' vessel  never\n\nveered  from its northerly direction before or during the helicopter's\n\npursuit,  whereas  their co-defendants'  vessel  at  some point  began\n\ntraveling  in   a  more  westerly  direction.     This  testimony  was\n\ncorroborated  by a videotape showing  the tracking and  seizure of the\n\ntwo vessels.  The jury  also heard several witnesses testify  that the\n\nFURA helicopter  initially pursued appellants' vessel.   Therefore, it\n\n                                 -12-\n\nwas  unlikely  that  the  jury  would  be  duped  or confused  by  the\n\nprosecutor's misleading statements suggesting that the FURA helicopter\n\ninitially chased the  vessel that  had veered away  from its  previous\n\ncourse.  \n\n         The likelihood  of jury  confusion was  further decreased  by\n\nthe  judge's repeated,  explicit  instructions to  the  jury that  the\n\nstatements and arguments  of counsel  were not evidence  in the  case.\n\nMateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d at 241; Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274; United                                                                              \n\nStates v.

Given  the isolated nature of the  comments, the strength\n\nof  the government's case against  appellants, and the  clarity of the\n\ndistrict  court's  instructions,  it  seems  most  unlikely  that  the\n\nmisleading  statements could  have affected the  outcome of  the case.\n\nThe plain error standard was not met.\n\n          Affirmed.                             \n\n                                 -13-\n",

The Grand  Regatta Columbus  was  a celebration  of  the 500th\nanniversary of  Columbus' discovery  of America  in which  hundreds of\nvessels  from dozens of  nations took part  in a  five-month race from\nEurope to America and  back in the  spring and summer  of 1992.

Flying at night without\n\nlights and with no flight plan, the aircraft made tight  circles about\n\n300  to  500 feet  above the  two vessels.    A Customs  Service pilot\n\nfollowing the suspect aircraft testified to having seen  moving lights\n\nfrom the  vessels.  From this  a reasonable jury could  infer that the\n\nvessels wished to be visible  to the aircraft.  Bales of  cocaine were\n\ndropped in proximity to the vessels from the aircraft, after which the\n\nvessels began heading  north towards the  shore with their  navigation\n\nlights turned  off.  At  first the  two boats traveled  together at  a\n\ndistance of about  100 yards.  After the second vessel veered off in a\n\nwesterly direction, a  police helicopter was  directed over the  first\n\nvessel,  occupied by  the  appellants.   The  helicopter was  lit  and\n\nidentified  as a police helicopter  by the letters  \"FURA,\" which were\n\ntwelve  to  sixteen  inches  long.    A  police  sergeant  aboard  the\n\nhelicopter  gestured for appellants  to stop.   Appellants  looked up,\n\nreduced  speed, and  then accelerated.   When  a police  marine vessel\n\nsubsequently approached,  appellants' vessel  veered off in  order, it\n\nmight  be  inferred,  to get  away.    While  other explanations  were\n\noffered,  a jury  could  reasonably conclude  from  this conduct  that\n\nappellants were  conscious of having engaged in  criminal activity and\n\nwere  more than mere inadvertent bystanders  at the drug drop.

For  example,  appellants  object  to  the  district court's\n\ndefinition  of possession  with intent  to distribute.   The  district\n\ncourt  defined this element as  possessing \"with intent  to deliver or\n\ntransfer  possession of a controlled  substance to another person with                                                                              \n\n                                 -6-\n\nor without any financial interest in the transaction.\"  We see nothing                                                            \n\nwrong  in this.  See Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases), Fifth                            \n\nCircuit, Instruction  45, at  III-73 (1991); Federal  Judicial Center,\n\nPattern Criminal  Jury Instructions  (1987), Instruction 112,  at 147.\n\nAppellants contend that the instruction would permit a jury to convict\n\nappellants  and  their co-defendants  for  delivering  cocaine to  the\n\npolice.   This argument, however,  ignores the fact  that the district\n\ncourt  clearly  and correctly  defined  the  elements of  willfulness,\n\nintent, and knowledge elsewhere in the charge.  Considering the charge\n\nas  a whole,  we find  nothing that  would cause  the jury  to convict\n\nappellants without finding the requisite criminal intent. \n\n         Appellants  make  a  similar  argument  as  to  the  district\n\ncourt's  definition   of  constructive   possession.     According  to\n\nappellants,  the  definition  was   misleading  because  the  required\n\nintentional  aspects  were  only  vaguely   and  ambiguously  defined.\n\nBecause  appellants failed  to make  this objection  to the  charge at\n\ntrial, we  will reverse only upon  a showing of \"plain  error.\"  E.g.,                                                                             \n\nUnited States v.

We see no instructional error, plain\n\nor  otherwise,  that could  have  confused  the  jury into  convicting\n\nappellants without finding the requisite criminal intent.\n\n         Appellants  additionally contend  that  the  district court's\n\nopening remarks  to the  jury on  the concept  of aiding  and abetting\n\ncreated an impermissible mandatory presumption.  During these remarks,\n\nthe district court stated  that \"[a]iding and abetting means  when two\n\nor more persons assist each other, basically,  in the commission of an\n\noffense,  . .  . all of  them are  presumed to be  responsible for the\n\nwhole  acts committed together.\"  This statement, while not a complete\n\nexplanation  of the concept  of aiding and abetting,  did not create a\n\nmandatory  presumption of guilt.   Instead, it merely  explained, in a\n\npreliminary fashion, that  aiding and abetting is a form  of agency in\n\nwhich  the law holds a  defendant criminally responsible  for the acts\n\nand conduct of another person  even though the defendant may  not have\n\npersonally  committed every act constituting  the offense alleged.  Of\n\n                                 -8-\n\ncourse,  before a defendant may  be held criminally  responsible as an\n\naider  and  abettor, the  government  must  prove  that the  defendant\n\n\"associated himself with the underlying venture, participated in it as\n\nsomething he wished to bring about, and sought by his  actions to make\n\nit succeed.\"  United States  v.

Appellants  complain that  the prosecutor\n\nmisstated  the evidence during argument  of the Rule  29 motion before\n\nthe  trial  judge4   and  during  closing   argument  to  the   jury.5\n\n                                                \n\n3.    Appellants did not object  to the district court's definition of\nimportation,  which we  held, in  their co-defendants'  appeal,  to be\nerror, but not plain error.  See Alfredo Alvarado, Nos. 91-2075, 2076,                                                         \nslip op. at 9-11 (1st Cir. Dec. 31, 1992).\n\n4.    Since  the jury was not present during  the prosecutor's Rule 29\nargument,  appellants cannot  claim  that any  part  of that  argument\nimproperly  influenced the  jury.   The statements  made to  the judge\nalone were,  for the most part,  fully supported by the  record.  Only\none seems unsupported.   That involved whether appellants'  vessel was\nstationary  when the FURA helicopter  first approached.   We find this\n\n                                 -9-\n\nAppellants' arguments are severely  hampered by their failure  to have\n\nmade  contemporaneous objections to  the allegedly  offensive remarks.\n\nAbsence of objection to a prosecutor's remarks limits appellate review\n\nto  the plain error standard.

Appellants  also  contend  that   the  prosecutor's  improper\nintroduction of hearsay evidence constituted prosecutorial misconduct.\nAppellants complain  specifically of the testimony  of Customs Service\nradar operator Richard Cunnicelli  that he saw flashing lights  in the\nwater as the suspect  aircraft approached the two vessels.   On cross-\nexamination, Cunnicelli  admitted that he never  actually saw anything\nin the  water because his  eyes were  focused on the  radar equipment.\nInstead, he heard  the pilot say,  \"I see  lights.\"  Appellants  argue\nthat they were prevented from  effectively objecting to this testimony\nby  the prosecutor's failure  to provide  Cunnicelli's rough  notes to\nappellants during  discovery.   Unlike  their co-defendants,  however,\nappellants never requested  these notes;  nor did they  object to  the\nadmission of  this testimony at trial; nor did they move to strike the\nhearsay testimony.  We are therefore  foreclosed from considering this\nissue on appeal  absent plain  error, which appellants  are unable  to\nestablish.   See United  States v.

During closing argument, the prosecutor\n\ndiscussed appellants' attempt to evade apprehension:\n\n              It  is only  as they are  about to  get caught\n         that all  of a  sudden one  vessel  starts to  veer\n         away.\n              Which   vessel?    How  interesting  that  the\n         defendant [Alfredo Alvarado] says,  the one that is\n         the lightest.  That is the one that went off.  That\n         is the one that took off.  That was the  decoy.  It\n         could get away quicker.\n              And sure enough,  the FURA helicopter in  fact\n         went after  the vessel that appeared  to be getting\n         away.\n\nTo  the  extent that  these  remarks suggest  that  appellants' vessel\n\nveered away, i.e., changed its course  from north to west, the remarks\n\nwere misleading.  It was the co-defendants' vessel that  veered off in\n\na westerly direction, not appellants' vessel.  Nevertheless, the  FURA\n\nhelicopter initially pursued appellants'  vessel, which apparently was\n\nlighter and could get away quicker.\n\n         The  above-quoted comments  did not  amount to  plain  error.\n\nThey were isolated and,  in relation to the body of  evidence received\n\nduring trial,  relatively insignificant.  The jury had heard testimony\n\nfrom a number  of government witnesses  that appellants' vessel  never\n\nveered  from its northerly direction before or during the helicopter's\n\npursuit,  whereas  their co-defendants'  vessel  at  some point  began\n\ntraveling  in   a  more  westerly  direction.     This  testimony  was\n\ncorroborated  by a videotape showing  the tracking and  seizure of the\n\ntwo vessels.  The jury  also heard several witnesses testify  that the\n\nFURA helicopter  initially pursued appellants' vessel.   Therefore, it\n\n                                 -12-\n\nwas  unlikely  that  the  jury  would  be  duped  or confused  by  the\n\nprosecutor's misleading statements suggesting that the FURA helicopter\n\ninitially chased the  vessel that  had veered away  from its  previous\n\ncourse.  \n\n         The likelihood  of jury  confusion was  further decreased  by\n\nthe  judge's repeated,  explicit  instructions to  the  jury that  the\n\nstatements and arguments  of counsel  were not evidence  in the  case.\n\nMateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d at 241; Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274; United                                                                              \n\nStates v.
