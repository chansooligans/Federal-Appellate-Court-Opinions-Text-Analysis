In No. 93-1405, we do so substantially\n\nfor  the reasons  articulated by  the district  court in  its\n\ncomprehensive trio of  decisions.  We add only  that, even if\n\nplaintiff had a right under  Louisiana law to appeal from the\n\nextradition order, see, e.g., State v. Hegwood, 510 So.2d 380\n                                              \n\n(La. 1987); State v. Morales,  478 So.2d 943 (La. App. 1985),\n                            \n\nplaintiff has failed  to demonstrate  that the New  Hampshire\n\nstate defendants  were in any way involved with, or otherwise\n\naccountable  for,  any  abridgement  of   that  right.    See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  McBride v.  Soos, 679  F.2d  1223, 1227  (7th Cir.\n                           \n\n1982) (\"It  is unreasonable  to require  the demanding  state\n\nagents to be familiar with  the procedural safeguards enacted\n\nin the asylum  state's extradition statutes and  then further\n\nrequire them  to ensure  that the  statutory safeguards  have\n\nbeen followed.\"). \n\n     In No. 93-1424, we need not decide  whether defendant, a\n\nprivate  law firm, can  be said to have  acted under color of\n\nstate  law.   It suffices  to conclude,  as explained  by the\n\nMagistrate-Judge  in  his  Report  and  Recommendation,  that\n\ndefendant in any event was under no constitutional obligation\n\nto  affix  a  legend  to   the  mail  it  sent  to  plaintiff\n\ndesignating such correspondence  as \"legal and confidential.\"\n\nPlaintiff's dispute is not with defendant but rather with the\n\nNew Hampshire prison regulations that  govern the opening and\n\nreading of mail received by inmates.  Because the law in this\n\narea  is unsettled,1 our  affirmance is without  prejudice to\n\nplaintiff filing a separate action against appropriate prison\n\nofficials challenging such regulations. \n\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n                                \n\n                    \n\n1.
