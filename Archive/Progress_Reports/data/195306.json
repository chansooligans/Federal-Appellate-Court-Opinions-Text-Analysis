The judgment of the district court is\n                    \n\naffirmed substantially for the reasons stated in the district\n\ncourt's April 29, 1993 memorandum and order.\n\n          In addition, we  must consider one  claim that  the\n\ndistrict court  did not specifically address  in its opinion.\n\nWoodard alleged  that even  though  applicable Department  of\n\nCorrection regulations were not changed until 1987 to  delete\n\nAlcoholics  Anonymous and  drug counseling  from the  list of\n\nprograms for  which prisoners could get  good-time credit, in\n\n1981 the Department of Correction issued a policy  memorandum\n\neliminating good-time  credit for these programs.   From 1981\n\nor 1982 to 1987, the Department followed this memorandum, not\n\nthe regulations.  \n\n          Woodard  further alleged,  and defendants  have not\n\ndisputed, that the  Massachusetts Superior Court  ruled in  a\n\n1991 case (cited by  Woodard as Cleary v. Rakie,  no. 90-6387\n                                               \n\n(Middlesex Super. Ct. 1991) (unpublished)), that this 1981-87\n\npractice had  been improper because it  contravened the then-\n\ngoverning  regulations.   The  court allegedly  directed  the\n\nDepartment  to  comply   with  the  regulatory   mandate  and\n\nretroactively   award   prisoners   good-time    credit   for\n\nsatisfactory participation in these programs during the 1981-\n\n87 period.  Neither party has supplied this court with a copy\n\nof the Superior Court decision, which is not in the record.  \n\n          Woodard filed as  an attachment below  a March  18,\n\n1992  memorandum from  defendant DuBois, the  Commissioner of\n\nCorrection,  advising  corrections personnel,  \"Recently, the\n\nMiddlesex Superior Court issued a  decision declaring invalid\n\nthe  Department of Correction's  1981 policy memorandum which\n\nmade  certain  programs  ineligible  for  earned  good   time\n\ncredits.\"  The  memorandum directed corrections  personnel to\n\n\"begin on or before March  27, 1992\" to recalculate good-time\n\ncredit  and   release  dates  for  each   inmate  to  reflect\n\nappropriate credit for participation in these programs during\n\nthe 1982-87 period.  This March 27 deadline was less than two\n\nweeks before  Woodard's release from prison on April 8, 1992.\n\nWoodard alleges that his release date was never recalculated.\n\n          On this  basis, Woodard  argues that the  denial of\n\ngood-time credit for participation  in these programs  during\n\n1981-87, in apparent contravention of applicable regulations,\n\nviolated his constitutional rights.  We disagree.\n\n          The Department's 1981  policy memorandum,  whatever\n\nits status under state law, did not violate the ex post facto\n\nclause of the Constitution, art. 1,   10, cl. 1, for the same\n\nreasons  -- stated  by the  district court  -- that  the 1987\n\nchange in the  regulations did  not.  After  the 1981  policy\n\nmemorandum, Woodard  remained eligible  for exactly  the same\n\ntotal amount of good-time credit, for participation in a wide\n\nrange of available programs, as he had been before.  All that\n\nchanged  was  that  he  had to  select  programs  other  than\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous and drug counseling to earn such credit.\n\nConsequently, the unavailability of these particular programs\n\n                             -3-\n\ndid not establish a regime that was more onerous to him.  For\n\nthat  reason,  the  1981  policy memorandum,  like  the  1987\n\nregulations,  did   not  \"substantially  alter  .   .  .  the\n\nconsequences attached  to  a  crime  already  completed,  and\n\ntherefore  change . . . 'the quantum of punishment.'\"  Weaver\n                                                             \n\nv.

The\n            \n\nConstitution itself does not guarantee  a right to earn good-\n\ntime credits.  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1974).\n                                 \n\n          The only argument remaining for Woodard, therefore,\n\nis that  the Department's failure to  award good-time credits\n\nfor participation in these programs during the 1981-87 period\n\nviolated  a constitutionally protected liberty interest based\n\nin  state law.  \"A State creates a protected liberty interest\n\nby placing  substantive limitations on  official discretion.\"\n\nBowser  v.

Even where\n                   \n\napplicable    statutes    create    no   liberty    interest,\n\nadministrative  regulations  may   do  so  if   they  contain\n\n                             -4-\n\n\"specific  directives  to  the  decisionmaker   that  if  the\n\nregulations' substantive predicates are present, a particular\n\noutcome  must  follow.\"   Kentucky  Dep't  of Corrections  v.\n                                                         \n\nThompson,  490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989).  See Rodi v. Ventetuolo,\n                                                            \n\n941 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1991). \n\n          The   Massachusetts  statute   governing  good-time\n\ncredits states: \"For  the . .  . satisfactory performance  of\n\nsaid inmates  in  any other  program  or activity  which  the\n\nsuperintendent of the institution shall deem valuable to said\n\nprisoner's rehabilitation, the commissioner may grant . . . a\n                                               \n\nfurther deduction of sentence  . . . .\"    Mass. Gen. Laws c.\n\n127,   129D (1993).  No liberty interest in earning good-time\n\ncredit derives  from this statute because  the statute places\n\nthe award  of good-time credit  within the discretion  of the\n\nCommissioner.   Cf. Bowser, supra,  968 F.2d  at 109  (courts\n                                 \n\nhave  found use  of language  such as  \"may\"  insufficient to\n\ncreate a liberty interest).\n\n          The 1978  Department of Correction  regulations, in\n\neffect during  the 1981-87 period, provided,  \"A resident for\n\nhis   satisfactory   conduct,  satisfactory   completion,  or\n\nsatisfactory performance in a program or activity may receive\n                                                     \n\na deduction from sentence of not more than seven and one half\n\ndays a  month.\"  103  Code of Mass. Regs.    411.09(1) (1978)\n\n(emphasis added).  The regulations granted the  determination\n\nwhether  or  not   to  award  a  sentence  reduction  to  the\n\n                             -5-\n\nCommissioner,  id.    411.10(10-12),  and did  not state  any\n                 \n\ncriteria  -- beyond the  requirement of satisfactory conduct,\n\ncompletion,  or performance  --  by which  the Commissioner's\n\ndetermination was to be governed.  \n\n          Like  the  statute,  these   regulations  contained\n\nneither  substantive  predicates  nor mandatory  language  to\n\nlimit  the Commissioner's  discretion  in  his  determination\n\nwhether  to award  good-time  credit for  participation in  a\n\nparticular program.  For  that reason, they did not  create a\n\nliberty interest.\n\n          The only relevant  mandatory language may  be found\n\nin    411.08(1)(g),  which stated  that the  activities which\n\nwould carry  eligibility for good-time credit  \"shall include\n                                                     \n\nbut not  be limited to  . .  . alcoholics anonymous,  or drug\n\ncounseling.\"  Id.   411.08(1)(g) (emphasis added).   The most\n                 \n\nthat  this language mandated, however,  was that if an inmate\n\nparticipated  in one of  these programs, the  inmate would be\n\nentitled to a discretionary determination by the Commissioner\n\nwhether  the participation  was  \"satisfactory\"  and  whether\n\ngood-time  credit would  be awarded.    In other  words, this\n\nprovision, at most, mandated only  that an inmate be accorded\n\na  particular  procedure,  not   that  an  inmate  receive  a\n\nparticular outcome if specified substantive criteriawere met.\n\n          Such a  provision -- mandating a  procedure only --\n\ndoes not create a liberty interest.  Ewell v. Murray, 11 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n                             -6-\n\n482,  488 (4th Cir. 1993)  (\"inmates do not  have a protected\n\nliberty interest  in the  procedures themselves, only  in the\n                                               \n\nsubject  matter to  which  they are  directed\") (emphasis  in\n\noriginal).   Accordingly, the 1981 policy  memorandum did not\n\ndeprive  Woodard  of  a  constitutionally  protected  liberty\n\ninterest -- regardless of whether it may have  violated state\n\nlaw -- when it removed these programs from the list of  those\n\ncarrying  eligibility  for   good-time  credit.     Nor   did\n\ndefendants  deprive Woodard  of a  constitutionally protected\n\nliberty  interest  if, as  alleged,  they failed  in  1992 to\n\nreview his  record of participation in  these programs during\n\nthe 1981-87  period to determine whether  a retroactive award\n\nof good-time credit was appropriate.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -7-\n",

The most that this language mandated, however, was that if an inmate participated in one of these programs, the inmate would be entitled to a discretionary determination by the Commissioner whether the participation was \"satisfactory\" and whether good-time credit would be awarded.

Woodard alleged that even though applicable Department of Correction regulations were not changed until 1987 to delete Alcoholics Anonymous and drug counseling from the list of programs for which prisoners could get good-time credit, in 1981 the Department of Correction issued a policy memorandum eliminating good-time credit for these programs.  From 1981 or 1982 to 1987, the Department followed this memorandum, not the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodard further alleged, and defendants have not disputed, that the Massachusetts Superior Court ruled in a 1991 case (cited by Woodard as Cleary v. Rakie, no.  90-6387 (Middlesex Super.  Ct. 1991) (unpublished)), that this 1981-87 practice had been improper because it contravened the then- governing regulations.  The court allegedly directed the Department to comply with the regulatory mandate and retroactively award prisoners good-time credit for satisfactory participation in these programs during the 1981-87 period.  Neither party has supplied this court with a copy of the Superior Court decision, which is not in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodard filed as an attachment below a March 18, 1992 memorandum from defendant DuBois, the Commissioner of Correction, advising corrections personnel, \"Recently, the Middlesex Superior Court issued a decision declaring invalid the Department of Correction's 1981 policy memorandum which made certain programs ineligible for earned good time credits.\"  The memorandum directed corrections personnel to \"begin on or before March 27, 1992\" to recalculate good-time credit and release dates for each inmate to reflect appropriate credit for participation in these programs during the 1982-87 period.  This March 27 deadline was less than two weeks before Woodard's release from prison on April 8, 1992.  Woodard alleges that his release date was never recalculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this basis, Woodard argues that the denial of good-time credit for participation in these programs during 1981-87, in apparent contravention of applicable regulations, violated his constitutional rights.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department's 1981 policy memorandum, whatever its status under state law, did not violate the ex post facto clause of the Constitution, art. 1, Sec. 10, cl. 1, for the same reasons-stated by the district court-that the 1987 change in the regulations did not.  After the 1981 policy memorandum, Woodard remained eligible for exactly the same total amount of good-time credit, for participation in a wide range of available programs, as he had been before.  All that changed was that he had to select programs other than Alcoholics Anonymous and drug counseling to earn such credit.  Consequently, the unavailability of these particular programs did not establish a regime that was more onerous to him.  For that reason, the 1981 policy memorandum, like the 1987 regulations, did not \"substantially alter ... the consequences attached to a crime already completed, and therefore change ... 'the quantum of punishment.' \"  Weaver v.

The Constitution itself does not guarantee a right to earn good-time credits.  Wolff v.

Gen. Laws c. 127, Sec. 129D (1993).  No liberty interest in earning good-time credit derives from this statute because the statute places the award of good-time credit within the discretion of the Commissioner.  Cf. Bowser, supra, 968 F.2d at 109 (courts have found use of language such as \"may\" insufficient to create a liberty interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1978 Department of Correction regulations, in effect during the 1981-87 period, provided, \"A resident for his satisfactory conduct, satisfactory completion, or satisfactory performance in a program or activity may receive a deduction from sentence of not more than seven and one half days a month.\"  103 Code of Mass.  Regs. Sec. 411.09(1) (1978) (emphasis added).  The regulations granted the determination whether or not to award a sentence reduction to the Commissioner, id. Sec. 411.10(10-12), and did not state any criteria-beyond the requirement of satisfactory conduct, completion, or performance-by which the Commissioner's determination was to be governed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the statute, these regulations contained neither substantive predicates nor mandatory language to limit the Commissioner's discretion in his determination whether to award good-time credit for participation in a particular program.
