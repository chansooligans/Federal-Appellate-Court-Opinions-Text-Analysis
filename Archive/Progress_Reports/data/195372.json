Claimant,  Felix  Cruz-Gonzalez,\n                      \n\nappeals from a district court opinion affirming a decision by\n\nthe Secretary of Health  and Human Services (the \"Secretary\")\n\ndenying  benefits   for  part   of  the  claimed   period  of\n\ndisability.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Claimant  filed his  first  application  for  disability\n\ninsurance benefits on August  21, 1989, alleging an inability\n\nto  work  since December  13, 1987  on  account of  a nervous\n\ncondition, asthma  and headaches.   The Secretary  denied the\n\napplication  initially   and,   on   March   29,   1990,   on\n\nreconsideration.   Claimant did  not request  a hearing.   On\n\nDecember 18,  1990, claimant  filed a second  application for\n\nbenefits, again alleging an  inability to work since December\n\n13, 1987 on account of a nervous condition, asthma, headaches\n\nand  occasional   back  pain.    The   Secretary  denied  the\n\napplication initially and on reconsideration.  Claimant, with\n\nthe  assistance of  counsel,  requested a  hearing before  an\n\nAdministrative Law Judge.   The hearing was held  on November\n\n26, 1991.\n\n     At  the time  of  the hearing,  claimant was  fifty-five\n\nyears of age and had a fifth grade education.   He had worked\n\nin a cigar factory and as a gas station  attendant.  Claimant\n\ntestified that he sufferred  from bronchial asthma, for which\n\nhe received  respiratory therapy.  He  further testified that\n\n                             -2-\n\nhe  had a  nervous condition  which caused  him to  cry every\n\nnight and for which he took medication and received treatment\n\nat  the Mental  Health  Center in  Cayey.   Claimant  alleged\n\nalmost constant pain in his right arm and back, for  which he\n\ntook  aspirin.  Claimant testified that he could only sit for\n\nfifteen to twenty minutes at a time because of his back pain.\n\nHe further stated that  he could not  push and pull with  his\n\narms, could not use his legs to operate any type of machinery\n\nand could  \"barely\" squat or bend.  Claimant reportedly spent\n\nmost of his time sleeping or watching television.\n\n     The ALJ  presented the  Vocational Expert (\"VE\")  with a\n\nhypothetical that described  a person who could  only work in\n\nclean,  well-ventilated environments,  free of  strong odors,\n\ndust and gas.  The hypothetical  also noted the need to avoid\n\nextreme temperatures and  places of  high relative  humidity.\n\nThe  ALJ   described   a  person   with   \"moderate\"   mental\n\nlimitations, moderate  limitations in his  ability to perform\n\ndaily activities and  capable of performing  only non-skilled\n\nwork.   The ALJ further described  this hypothetical person's\n\ndeficiency in concentrating as \"quite frequent.\"\n\n     The VE testified that this hypothetical person could not\n\nperform the work that claimant had performed in the past as a\n\ngas station attendant,  but that he could  perform other jobs\n\nof  a non-skilled  nature.  The  ALJ asked the  VE to further\n\nassume that the person could not push and pull with his right\n\n                             -3-\n\n(skillful)  hand,  that he  could lift  only light  weight (a\n\nmaximum of  ten  pounds), and  that  he needed  to  alternate\n\npositions.   The VE  testified that, taking  these additional\n\nlimitations  into  account,  there  were jobs  in  the  local\n\neconomy that a person with the hypothesized limitations could\n\nperform.  Examples were wire cutter, stamper and wire worker.\n\n     The   ALJ   referred  to   an   independent  psychiatric\n\nevaluation  of  claimant  performed  by   Dr.  Rafael  Miguez\n\nBalseiro in February, 1991.  Taking Dr. Miguez' diagnosis and\n\ndescription of  claimant's limitations into  account, the  VE\n\ntestified  that  claimant  could  perform  the  jobs  he  had\n\nidentified.   If claimant's own description  of his condition\n\nand symptoms as expressed at the hearing were true,  however,\n\nthe VE testified that  claimant would not be able  to perform\n\nthe identified jobs or any others in the national economy.\n\n     On December 17,  1991, the ALJ  issued a decision  which\n\ndivided claimant's disability claim into three distinct  time\n\nperiods: 1)  from the claimed onset date (12/13/87) until the\n\ndate  of  the  Secretary's  denial  upon  reconsideration  of\n\nclaimant's initial  application  for benefits  (3/29/90);  2)\n\nfrom  the date of the  denial of the  first application until\n\nclaimant's  fifty-fifth  birthday  (11/21/91);  and  3)  from\n\nclaimant's fifty-fifth birthday until December 31,  1991 (the\n\ndate through which claimant was insured).\n\n                             -4-\n\n     With respect  to the  first period, the  ALJ interpreted\n\nclaimant's present  application  for benefits  (alleging  the\n\nsame  onset  date  and  similar  disabilities  as  his  first\n\napplication)  as  \"an   implied  request  for   revision  and\n\nreopening of the March 29, 1990 determination.\"  Finding that\n\nthere  was neither good cause  nor any other  basis under the\n\nrelevant regulations  for reopening  the prior case,  the ALJ\n\nheld that  the March,  1990 determination \"remains  final and\n\nbinding.\"     Therefore,  he   considered  only  evidence  of\n\nclaimant's condition in the period after March 29, 1990.  \n\n     Focusing  on  the  period  after March,  1990,  the  ALJ\n\ndetermined that claimant had a combination of lung and mental\n\nconditions,  but that  he  did  not  have \"an  impairment  or\n\ncombination of  impairments listed in, or  medically equal to\n\nthe  one listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4.\"\n\nAlthough unable  to perform his past  relevant work, claimant\n\nwas  capable of  light, clean,  unskilled work.   Considering\n\nclaimant's  age, education,  work  experience and  exertional\n\ncapacity as well as  his nonexertional limitations, and using\n\nRule 202.11  of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines,  20 C.F.R.\n\nPart   404,  Subpt.   P,   App.  2,   as   a  framework   for\n\ndecisionmaking, the ALJ found that \"claimant was not disabled\n\nunder the  Social Security Act  prior to November  21, 1991.\"\n\nAlthough the ALJ found claimant to be incapable of performing\n\nthe  full  range  of light  work,  he  relied  upon the  VE's\n\n                             -5-\n\ntestimony  that \"light  unskilled clean  jobs that  allow the\n\nclaimant  to  alternate  positions  when  needed\" existed  in\n\nsignificant numbers in the national economy.  \n\n     On  November 21,  1991, claimant turned  fifty-five, and\n\ntherefore  was  classified as  of  \"advanced  age\" under  the\n\nrelevant Social  Security regulations.  Using Rule  202.02 of\n\nthe  Medical-Vocational Guidelines  as a  framework, the  ALJ\n\nconcluded that after claimant  reached age 55, his functional\n\nlimitations, together with  other adverse vocational factors,\n\n\"preclude[d]  a  vocational  adjustment  to  other  work that\n\nexists in  significant  numbers  in  the  national  economy.\"\n\nTherefore, the ALJ found claimant  to be \"disabled\" under the\n\nSocial Security Act since November 21, 1991.\n\n     Following the  Appeals Council's  denial of  his request\n\nfor review  of the ALJ's  decision, claimant appealed  to the\n\ndistrict  court.  In an  opinion and order  dated October 13,\n\n1993, the  district court affirmed  the Secretary's decision.\n\nThe district  court found that since  claimant never appealed\n\nthe March 29, 1990 decision denying his first application for\n\nbenefits,  \"it  became a  final  decision  with res  judicata\n\neffect.\"  The Secretary's determination that there was no new\n\nand material evidence warranting a reopening of the case  was\n\nnot a reviewable decision. See  Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n99 (1977).  Therefore, the district court confined its review\n\nto the period between March 29, 1990 and November 21, 1991.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     The  district  court accurately  summarized  the medical\n\nrecords.   It found no support for claimant's contention that\n\nthe ALJ  had failed to  properly consider the  seriousness of\n\nhis condition or  that the hypothetical  presented to the  VE\n\nfailed   to   accurately   reflect  claimant's   impairments.\n\nTherefore, the district court affirmed the Secretary's denial\n\nof benefits for the period before November 21, 1991.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On appeal, claimant argues that the  Secretary's refusal\n\nto reopen its  March 29,  1990 decision  denying benefits  is\n\nreviewable by the  district court.  He further  contends that\n\nthe  ALJ's  determination  that claimant  was  not \"disabled\"\n\nunder the Social  Security Act before  November 21, 1991,  is\n\nnot   supported  by  substantial   evidence.    Specifically,\n\nclaimant contends that the ALJ did not give sufficient weight\n\nto his subjective allegations  and to the limitations imposed\n\nby claimant's environmental intolerances.\n\n     \"Absent  a colorable  constitutional  claim not  present\n\nhere, a district court  does not have jurisdiction  to review\n\nthe  Secretary's  discretionary  decision not  to  reopen  an\n\nearlier  adjudication.\" Torres  v.  Secretary  of Health  and\n                                                             \n\nHuman Services, 845  F.2d 1136,  1138 (1st Cir.  1988).

He contends that the failure to reopen\n\nhis case violates  due process because  there was no  hearing\n\nheld  on his first request  for benefits.   Claimant does not\n\ncontend that he was denied an opportunity for a hearing.  The\n\nrecord indicates, instead, that in the  denial of his request\n\nfor reconsideration,  claimant was  informed of his  right to\n\nrequest a hearing before  an ALJ.  Caimant failed  to request\n\nsuch  a  hearing and  the decision  became  final.   Matos v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary  of Health,  Education  and Welfare,  581 F.2d  282\n                                             \n\npresented  similar  facts.    There, we  applied  Sanders  as\n                                                         \n\nfollows:\n\n     Prior  to a  final  determination in  the  original\n     claim, appellant  could have secured a  hearing and\n     judicial   review,  if  she  had  pursued  all  her\n     remedies.    The holding  in  Sanders  provides, in\n                                          \n     essence, that  a claimant is not  given a guarantee\n     of  a second hearing and court  review if he waives\n     the first opportunity.\n\nMatos, 581 F.2d at 285.\n     \n\n     Claimant's reliance upon Shrader v. Harris, 631 F.2d 297\n                                               \n\n(4th Cir.  1980), is  misplaced.   There, the  Fourth Circuit\n\nheld that  it would  be a  denial of due  process to  dismiss\n\nclaimant's   application  on   res  judicata   grounds  where\n\n                             -8-\n\nclaimant's initial  claims were denied without  a hearing and\n                                                             \n\n\"mental  illness prevented [claimant]  from understanding the\n\nprocedure necessary  to obtain an  evidentiary hearing  after\n\nthe  denial of his prior pro se claim.\" Id. at 302.  There is\n                                           \n\nno support in the record for a finding that claimant's mental\n\nimpairment  rendered  him   incapable  of  understanding  the\n\nprocedure for  obtaining an evidentiary hearing  after denial\n\nof  his   initial  claim.     We  conclude   that  claimant's\n\nconstitutional  claim is not  colorable and  that, therefore,\n\nthe  district  court  correctly  determined  that  it  lacked\n\njurisdiction to review the  Secretary's failure to reopen its\n\nMarch 29, 1990 decision.\n\n      Claimant also argues that the Secretary's decision that\n\nhe was not disabled  between March 30, 1990 and  November 21,\n\n1991 was  unsupported by  substantial evidence.   We disagree\n\nfor  the reasons articulated by  the district court.   We add\n\nonly the following comments.\n\n     The VE testified that \"if we took into consideration the\n\nclaimant's subjective  allegations, he would not be qualified\n\nto  perform in  a sustained  manner the  job examples  I have\n\nindicated  and  or  any  others  in  our  national  economy.\"\n\nTherefore, in determining that claimant was not disabled, the\n\nALJ implicitly discredited claimant's subjective allegations.\n\n\"The credibility  determination by  the ALJ who  observed the\n\nclaimant, evaluated  his demeanor,  and  considered how  that\n\n                             -9-\n\ntestimony fit in with the rest of the evidence is entitled to\n\ndeference,.  . .\" Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987). \n        \n\n     At  his hearing,  claimant  described his  arm and  back\n\npain, including  the location and  frequency of the  pain, in\n\nthe  following  terms.    He testified  that  he  experienced\n\n\"strong\"  pains in  his back  and right  arm \"almost  all the\n\ntime.\"  The pain, allegedly,  prevented him from pushing  and\n\npulling with his arms and from using his  legs to operate any\n\ntype  of machinery and rendered him \"barely\" able to squat or\n\nbend.   He alleged that he  spent most of his  time sleeping.\n\nClaimant  also  testified  that  he  suffered  from  constant\n\nasthma,  requiring  medication  that  left  him  anxious  and\n\nnervous.  The ALJ  credited claimant's subjective allegations\n\nof pain  to the extent that he  found him to have \"exertional\n\nlimitations with his skillful  hand to push and pull\"  and to\n\nrequire a job that allowed him to alternate positions. \n\n     There is  substantial evidence in the  record to support\n\nthe  ALJ's  determination  that  claimant  was  not  rendered\n\n\"disabled\"  by his  pain or  other  afflictions.   In August,\n\n1991,  Dr.  A.M.  Marxauch   completed  a  Residual  Physical\n\nFunctional Capacity Assessment  (\"physical RFC\") in which  he\n\nconcluded  that  claimant  had  no  exertional,  postural  or\n\nmanipulative limitations.  Another physical RFC, prepared  by\n\nDr.  Gilberto   Fragoso  in  May,  1991,   reached  the  same\n\n                             -10-\n\nconclusions.   Notes from claimant's out-patient  visits to a\n\nlocal  mental  health center  indicate  that  he reported  in\n\nJanuary,  1990  that  he  was  \"functioning  adequately  with\n\nmedications\"  and was keeping himself entertained by spending\n\nhis days at a home for senior citizens. \n\n     Dr.  Miguez examined  claimant  in  February, 1991,  and\n\nreported that claimant's posture  was \"unremarkable\" and that\n\n\"no movement disorders are observed.\"  He also concluded that\n\nclaimant,  although  depressed,  was  \"in  good contact  with\n\nreality,\" coherent,  relevant and functioning  at \"a  regular\n\nintellectual  level.\"  An examining pulmonologist, Dr. Harold\n\nPola,  reported in  April,  1991 that  claimant's asthma  was\n\n\"well  controlled\" by his medication  and that, by  use of an\n\ninhaler, he  could avoid visits  to the local  health center.\n\nBased  upon the  above  evidence, we  conclude that  there is\n\nsubstantial  support in the record  for the ALJ's decision to\n\ndiscredit claimant's subjective allegations of  the disabling\n\nextent of his medical conditions.\n\n     Claimant  argues  on   appeal  that  the   environmental\n\nrestrictions  that his asthma  placed on his  ability to work\n\nshould  have resulted in a finding that he was disabled prior\n\nto  November 21,  1991.  Claimant  relies upon  the following\n\ncomment in Social Security Ruling No. 85-15:\n\n     Where an individual can tolerate very little noise,\n     dust, etc., the impact on the ability to work would\n     be considerable because  very few job  environments\n\n                             -11-\n\n     are  entirely  free of  irritants,  pollutants, and\n     other potentially damaging conditions.\n\nThe  physical  RFC prepared  by  Dr.  Fragoso concluded  that\n\nclaimant should \"avoid all exposure [to] fumes, odors, dusts,\n\ngases  poor  ventilation, etc.\"    The RFC  completed  by Dr.\n\nMarxauch, however, was less stringent, finding that  claimant\n\nshould \"avoid  even moderate  exposure\"  to those  irritants.\n\nDr. Pola reported that claimant complained that his asthmatic\n\nepisodes  were worsened  by  exposure to  fuel, fumes,  dust,\n\nsmoke  and cold  temperature.   The  doctor recommended  that\n\nclaimant \"avoid exposure\" to those substances.\n\n     At  the  hearing,  the  ALJ  presented  the  VE  with  a\n\nhypothetical  that  included   the  following   environmental\n\nrestrictions:\n\n     this  person can only work at places where there is\n     a  clean environment, free  of strong  odors, dust,\n     gas and in places  where ventilation is adequate, .\n     . . should avoid  extreme temperatures, cold or hot\n     and  in  addition  the person  should  avoid  humid\n     places  and places  where the relative  humidity is\n     high.\n\nConsidering these and  other non-environmental  restrictions,\n\nthe VE testified that there were at least three jobs existing\n\nin the local economy that claimant could  perform, all within\n\nthe electronic and  electric products manufacturing industry:\n\nwire cutter, stamper and wire worker.  The VE's testimony was\n\nbased upon a hypothetical  that \"correspond[s] to conclusions\n\nsupported by . . .  medical authorities,\" Arocho v.

Therefore, his testimony was  relevant and supported\n\nthe Secretary's finding that  claimant was not disabled prior\n\nto November 21, 1991.\n\n     Accordingly, we  affirm  the district  court's  judgment\n\naffirming the  Secretary's denial of benefits  for the period\n\nprior to November 21, 1991. \n\n                             -13-\n",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant filed his first application for disability insurance benefits on August 21, 1989, alleging an inability to work since December 13, 1987 on account of a nervous condition, asthma and headaches.  The Secretary denied the application initially and, on March 29, 1990, on reconsideration.  Claimant did not request a hearing.  On December 18, 1990, claimant filed a second application for benefits, again alleging an inability to work since December 13, 1987 on account of a nervous condition, asthma, headaches and occasional back pain.  The Secretary denied the application initially and on reconsideration.  Claimant, with the assistance of counsel, requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.  The hearing was held on November 26, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the hearing, claimant was fifty-five years of age and had a fifth grade education.  He had worked in a cigar factory and as a gas station attendant.  Claimant testified that he sufferred from bronchial asthma, for which he received respiratory therapy.  He further testified that he had a nervous condition which caused him to cry every night and for which he took medication and received treatment at the Mental Health Center in Cayey.  Claimant alleged almost constant pain in his right arm and back, for which he took aspirin.  Claimant testified that he could only sit for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time because of his back pain.  He further stated that he could not push and pull with his arms, could not use his legs to operate any type of machinery and could \"barely\" squat or bend.  Claimant reportedly spent most of his time sleeping or watching television.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ presented the Vocational Expert (\"VE\") with a hypothetical that described a person who could only work in clean, well-ventilated environments, free of strong odors, dust and gas.  The hypothetical also noted the need to avoid extreme temperatures and places of high relative humidity.  The ALJ described a person with \"moderate\" mental limitations, moderate limitations in his ability to perform daily activities and capable of performing only non-skilled work.  The ALJ further described this hypothetical person's deficiency in concentrating as \"quite frequent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE testified that this hypothetical person could not perform the work that claimant had performed in the past as a gas station attendant, but that he could perform other jobs of a non-skilled nature.  The ALJ asked the VE to further assume that the person could not push and pull with his right (skillful) hand, that he could lift only light weight (a maximum of ten pounds), and that he needed to alternate positions.  The VE testified that, taking these additional limitations into account, there were jobs in the local economy that a person with the hypothesized limitations could perform.  Examples were wire cutter, stamper and wire worker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ referred to an independent psychiatric evaluation of claimant performed by Dr. Rafael Miguez Balseiro in February, 1991.  Taking Dr. Miguez' diagnosis and description of claimant's limitations into account, the VE testified that claimant could perform the jobs he had identified.  If claimant's own description of his condition and symptoms as expressed at the hearing were true, however, the VE testified that claimant would not be able to perform the identified jobs or any others in the national economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1991, the ALJ issued a decision which divided claimant's disability claim into three distinct time periods:  1) from the claimed onset date (12/13/87) until the date of the Secretary's denial upon reconsideration of claimant's initial application for benefits (3/29/90);  2) from the date of the denial of the first application until claimant's fifty-fifth birthday (11/21/91);  and 3) from claimant's fifty-fifth birthday until December 31, 1991 (the date through which claimant was insured).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first period, the ALJ interpreted claimant's present application for benefits (alleging the same onset date and similar disabilities as his first application) as \"an implied request for revision and reopening of the March 29, 1990 determination.\"  Finding that there was neither good cause nor any other basis under the relevant regulations for reopening the prior case, the ALJ held that the March, 1990 determination \"remains final and binding.\"  Therefore, he considered only evidence of claimant's condition in the period after March 29, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Focusing on the period after March, 1990, the ALJ determined that claimant had a combination of lung and mental conditions, but that he did not have \"an impairment or combination of impairments listed in, or medically equal to the one listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4.\" Although unable to perform his past relevant work, claimant was capable of light, clean, unskilled work.  Considering claimant's age, education, work experience and exertional capacity as well as his nonexertional limitations, and using Rule 202.11 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt.  P, App. 2, as a framework for decisionmaking, the ALJ found that \"claimant was not disabled under the Social Security Act prior to November 21, 1991.\"  Although the ALJ found claimant to be incapable of performing the full range of light work, he relied upon the VE's testimony that \"light unskilled clean jobs that allow the claimant to alternate positions when needed\" existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 1991, claimant turned fifty-five, and therefore was classified as of \"advanced age\" under the relevant Social Security regulations.  Using Rule 202.02 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines as a framework, the ALJ concluded that after claimant reached age 55, his functional limitations, together with other adverse vocational factors, \"preclude[d] a vocational adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.\"  Therefore, the ALJ found claimant to be \"disabled\" under the Social Security Act since November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the Appeals Council's denial of his request for review of the ALJ's decision, claimant appealed to the district court.  In an opinion and order dated October 13, 1993, the district court affirmed the Secretary's decision.  The district court found that since claimant never appealed the March 29, 1990 decision denying his first application for benefits, \"it became a final decision with res judicata effect.\"  The Secretary's determination that there was no new and material evidence warranting a reopening of the case was not a reviewable decision.   See Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  Therefore, the district court confined its review to the period between March 29, 1990 and November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accurately summarized the medical records.  It found no support for claimant's contention that the ALJ had failed to properly consider the seriousness of his condition or that the hypothetical presented to the VE failed to accurately reflect claimant's impairments.  Therefore, the district court affirmed the Secretary's denial of benefits for the period before November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the Secretary's refusal to reopen its March 29, 1990 decision denying benefits is reviewable by the district court.  He further contends that the ALJ's determination that claimant was not \"disabled\" under the Social Security Act before November 21, 1991, is not supported by substantial evidence.  Specifically, claimant contends that the ALJ did not give sufficient weight to his subjective allegations and to the limitations imposed by claimant's environmental intolerances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Absent a colorable constitutional claim not present here, a district court does not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's discretionary decision not to reopen an earlier adjudication.\"  Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human  Services, 845 F.2d 1136, 1138 (1st Cir. 1988).  See Califano v.  Sanders, 430 U.S. at 107-09;  Colon v. Secretary of Health and  Human Services, 877 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1989);  Dudley v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 816 F.2d 792, 795 (1st Cir. 1987);  Dvareckas v. Secretary of Health and Human  Services, 804 F.2d 770, 771 (1st Cir. 1986);  Matos v. Secretary  of Health and Human Services, 581 F.2d 282, 286 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's attempt to present a colorable constitutional claim is unavailing.  He contends that the failure to reopen his case violates due process because there was no hearing held on his first request for benefits.  Claimant does not contend that he was denied an opportunity for a hearing.  The record indicates, instead, that in the denial of his request for reconsideration, claimant was informed of his right to request a hearing before an ALJ.  Caimant failed to request such a hearing and the decision became final.   Matos v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 581 F.2d 282 presented similar facts.  There, we applied Sanders as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to a final determination in the original claim, appellant could have secured a hearing and judicial review, if she had pursued all her remedies.  The holding in Sanders provides, in essence, that a claimant is not given a guarantee of a second hearing and court review if he waives the first opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matos, 581 F.2d at 285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's reliance upon  Shrader v. Harris, 631 F.2d 297 (4th Cir. 1980), is misplaced.  There, the Fourth Circuit held that it would be a denial of due process to dismiss claimant's application on res judicata grounds where claimant's initial claims were denied without a hearing and \"mental illness prevented [claimant] from understanding the procedure necessary to obtain an evidentiary hearing after the denial of his prior pro se claim.\"   Id. at 302.  There is no support in the record for a finding that claimant's mental impairment rendered him incapable of understanding the procedure for obtaining an evidentiary hearing after denial of his initial claim.  We conclude that claimant's constitutional claim is not colorable and that, therefore, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary's failure to reopen its March 29, 1990 decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant also argues that the Secretary's decision that he was not disabled between March 30, 1990 and November 21, 1991 was unsupported by substantial evidence.  We disagree for the reasons articulated by the district court.  We add only the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE testified that \"if we took into consideration the claimant's subjective allegations, he would not be qualified to perform in a sustained manner the job examples I have indicated and or any others in our national economy.\"  Therefore, in determining that claimant was not disabled, the ALJ implicitly discredited claimant's subjective allegations.  \"The credibility determination by the ALJ who observed the claimant, evaluated his demeanor, and considered how that testimony fit in with the rest of the evidence is entitled to deference, ...\"  Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his hearing, claimant described his arm and back pain, including the location and frequency of the pain, in the following terms.  He testified that he experienced \"strong\" pains in his back and right arm \"almost all the time.\"  The pain, allegedly, prevented him from pushing and pulling with his arms and from using his legs to operate any type of machinery and rendered him \"barely\" able to squat or bend.  He alleged that he spent most of his time sleeping.  Claimant also testified that he suffered from constant asthma, requiring medication that left him anxious and nervous.  The ALJ credited claimant's subjective allegations of pain to the extent that he found him to have \"exertional limitations with his skillful hand to push and pull\" and to require a job that allowed him to alternate positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's determination that claimant was not rendered \"disabled\" by his pain or other afflictions.  In August, 1991, Dr. A.M. Marxauch completed a Residual Physical Functional Capacity Assessment (\"physical RFC\") in which he concluded that claimant had no exertional, postural or manipulative limitations.  Another physical RFC, prepared by Dr. Gilberto Fragoso in May, 1991, reached the same conclusions.  Notes from claimant's out- patient visits to a local mental health center indicate that he reported in January, 1990 that he was \"functioning adequately with medications\" and was keeping himself entertained by spending his days at a home for senior citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Miguez examined claimant in February, 1991, and reported that claimant's posture was \"unremarkable\" and that \"no movement disorders are observed.\"  He also concluded that claimant, although depressed, was \"in good contact with reality,\" coherent, relevant and functioning at \"a regular intellectual level.\"  An examining pulmonologist, Dr. Harold Pola, reported in April, 1991 that claimant's asthma was \"well controlled\" by his medication and that, by use of an inhaler, he could avoid visits to the local health center.  Based upon the above evidence, we conclude that there is substantial support in the record for the ALJ's decision to discredit claimant's subjective allegations of the disabling extent of his medical conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues on appeal that the environmental restrictions that his asthma placed on his ability to work should have resulted in a finding that he was disabled prior to November 21, 1991.  Claimant relies upon the following comment in Social Security Ruling No. 85-15:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an individual can tolerate very little noise, dust, etc., the impact on the ability to work would be considerable because very few job environments are entirely free of irritants, pollutants, and other potentially damaging conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The physical RFC prepared by Dr. Fragoso concluded that claimant should \"avoid all exposure [to] fumes, odors, dusts, gases poor ventilation, etc.\"  The RFC completed by Dr. Marxauch, however, was less stringent, finding that claimant should \"avoid even moderate exposure\" to those irritants.  Dr. Pola reported that claimant complained that his asthmatic episodes were worsened by exposure to fuel, fumes, dust, smoke and cold temperature.  The doctor recommended that claimant \"avoid exposure\" to those substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the ALJ presented the VE with a hypothetical that included the following environmental restrictions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">this person can only work at places where there is a clean environment, free of strong odors, dust, gas and in places where ventilation is adequate, ... should avoid extreme temperatures, cold or hot and in addition the person should avoid humid places and places where the relative humidity is high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering these and other non-environmental restrictions, the VE testified that there were at least three jobs existing in the local economy that claimant could perform, all within the electronic and electric products manufacturing industry:  wire cutter, stamper and wire worker.  The VE's testimony was based upon a hypothetical that \"correspond[s] to conclusions supported by ... medical authorities,\" Arocho v. Secretary of  Health and Human Services, 670 F.2d 374, 375 (1st Cir. 1982).  Therefore, his testimony was relevant and supported the Secretary's finding that claimant was not disabled prior to November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment affirming the Secretary's denial of benefits for the period prior to November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Claimant reportedly spent most of his time sleeping or watching television.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ presented the Vocational Expert (\"VE\") with a hypothetical that described a person who could only work in clean, well-ventilated environments, free of strong odors, dust and gas.  The hypothetical also noted the need to avoid extreme temperatures and places of high relative humidity.  The ALJ described a person with \"moderate\" mental limitations, moderate limitations in his ability to perform daily activities and capable of performing only non-skilled work.  The ALJ further described this hypothetical person's deficiency in concentrating as \"quite frequent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE testified that this hypothetical person could not perform the work that claimant had performed in the past as a gas station attendant, but that he could perform other jobs of a non-skilled nature.  The ALJ asked the VE to further assume that the person could not push and pull with his right (skillful) hand, that he could lift only light weight (a maximum of ten pounds), and that he needed to alternate positions.  The VE testified that, taking these additional limitations into account, there were jobs in the local economy that a person with the hypothesized limitations could perform.  Examples were wire cutter, stamper and wire worker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ referred to an independent psychiatric evaluation of claimant performed by Dr. Rafael Miguez Balseiro in February, 1991.  Taking Dr. Miguez' diagnosis and description of claimant's limitations into account, the VE testified that claimant could perform the jobs he had identified.  If claimant's own description of his condition and symptoms as expressed at the hearing were true, however, the VE testified that claimant would not be able to perform the identified jobs or any others in the national economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1991, the ALJ issued a decision which divided claimant's disability claim into three distinct time periods:  1) from the claimed onset date (12/13/87) until the date of the Secretary's denial upon reconsideration of claimant's initial application for benefits (3/29/90);  2) from the date of the denial of the first application until claimant's fifty-fifth birthday (11/21/91);  and 3) from claimant's fifty-fifth birthday until December 31, 1991 (the date through which claimant was insured).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first period, the ALJ interpreted claimant's present application for benefits (alleging the same onset date and similar disabilities as his first application) as \"an implied request for revision and reopening of the March 29, 1990 determination.\"  Finding that there was neither good cause nor any other basis under the relevant regulations for reopening the prior case, the ALJ held that the March, 1990 determination \"remains final and binding.\"  Therefore, he considered only evidence of claimant's condition in the period after March 29, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Focusing on the period after March, 1990, the ALJ determined that claimant had a combination of lung and mental conditions, but that he did not have \"an impairment or combination of impairments listed in, or medically equal to the one listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4.\" Although unable to perform his past relevant work, claimant was capable of light, clean, unskilled work.  Considering claimant's age, education, work experience and exertional capacity as well as his nonexertional limitations, and using Rule 202.11 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt.  P, App. 2, as a framework for decisionmaking, the ALJ found that \"claimant was not disabled under the Social Security Act prior to November 21, 1991.\"  Although the ALJ found claimant to be incapable of performing the full range of light work, he relied upon the VE's testimony that \"light unskilled clean jobs that allow the claimant to alternate positions when needed\" existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 1991, claimant turned fifty-five, and therefore was classified as of \"advanced age\" under the relevant Social Security regulations.  Using Rule 202.02 of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines as a framework, the ALJ concluded that after claimant reached age 55, his functional limitations, together with other adverse vocational factors, \"preclude[d] a vocational adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.\"  Therefore, the ALJ found claimant to be \"disabled\" under the Social Security Act since November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the Appeals Council's denial of his request for review of the ALJ's decision, claimant appealed to the district court.  In an opinion and order dated October 13, 1993, the district court affirmed the Secretary's decision.  The district court found that since claimant never appealed the March 29, 1990 decision denying his first application for benefits, \"it became a final decision with res judicata effect.\"  The Secretary's determination that there was no new and material evidence warranting a reopening of the case was not a reviewable decision.   See Califano v. Sanders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109606\"><a href=\"/opinion/109606/califano-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span> (1977).  Therefore, the district court confined its review to the period between March 29, 1990 and November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accurately summarized the medical records.  It found no support for claimant's contention that the ALJ had failed to properly consider the seriousness of his condition or that the hypothetical presented to the VE failed to accurately reflect claimant's impairments.  Therefore, the district court affirmed the Secretary's denial of benefits for the period before November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the Secretary's refusal to reopen its March 29, 1990 decision denying benefits is reviewable by the district court.  He further contends that the ALJ's determination that claimant was not \"disabled\" under the Social Security Act before November 21, 1991, is not supported by substantial evidence.  Specifically, claimant contends that the ALJ did not give sufficient weight to his subjective allegations and to the limitations imposed by claimant's environmental intolerances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Absent a colorable constitutional claim not present here, a district court does not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's discretionary decision not to reopen an earlier adjudication.\"  Torres v.

He contends that the failure to reopen his case violates due process because there was no hearing held on his first request for benefits.  Claimant does not contend that he was denied an opportunity for a hearing.  The record indicates, instead, that in the denial of his request for reconsideration, claimant was informed of his right to request a hearing before an ALJ.  Caimant failed to request such a hearing and the decision became final.   Matos v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358672\"><a href=\"/opinion/358672/matilde-matos-v-secretary-of-health-education-and-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span> presented similar facts.  There, we applied Sanders as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to a final determination in the original claim, appellant could have secured a hearing and judicial review, if she had pursued all her remedies.  The holding in Sanders provides, in essence, that a claimant is not given a guarantee of a second hearing and court review if he waives the first opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matos, 581 F.2d at 285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's reliance upon  Shrader v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382321\"><a href=\"/opinion/382321/claude-danny-shrader-v-patricia-r-harris-secretary-of-health-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span> (4th Cir. 1980), is misplaced.  There, the Fourth Circuit held that it would be a denial of due process to dismiss claimant's application on res judicata grounds where claimant's initial claims were denied without a hearing and \"mental illness prevented [claimant] from understanding the procedure necessary to obtain an evidentiary hearing after the denial of his prior pro se claim.\"   Id. at 302.  There is no support in the record for a finding that claimant's mental impairment rendered him incapable of understanding the procedure for obtaining an evidentiary hearing after denial of his initial claim.  We conclude that claimant's constitutional claim is not colorable and that, therefore, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary's failure to reopen its March 29, 1990 decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant also argues that the Secretary's decision that he was not disabled between March 30, 1990 and November 21, 1991 was unsupported by substantial evidence.  We disagree for the reasons articulated by the district court.  We add only the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE testified that \"if we took into consideration the claimant's subjective allegations, he would not be qualified to perform in a sustained manner the job examples I have indicated and or any others in our national economy.\"  Therefore, in determining that claimant was not disabled, the ALJ implicitly discredited claimant's subjective allegations.  \"The credibility determination by the ALJ who observed the claimant, evaluated his demeanor, and considered how that testimony fit in with the rest of the evidence is entitled to deference, ...\"  Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his hearing, claimant described his arm and back pain, including the location and frequency of the pain, in the following terms.  He testified that he experienced \"strong\" pains in his back and right arm \"almost all the time.\"  The pain, allegedly, prevented him from pushing and pulling with his arms and from using his legs to operate any type of machinery and rendered him \"barely\" able to squat or bend.  He alleged that he spent most of his time sleeping.  Claimant also testified that he suffered from constant asthma, requiring medication that left him anxious and nervous.  The ALJ credited claimant's subjective allegations of pain to the extent that he found him to have \"exertional limitations with his skillful hand to push and pull\" and to require a job that allowed him to alternate positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's determination that claimant was not rendered \"disabled\" by his pain or other afflictions.  In August, 1991, Dr. A.M. Marxauch completed a Residual Physical Functional Capacity Assessment (\"physical RFC\") in which he concluded that claimant had no exertional, postural or manipulative limitations.  Another physical RFC, prepared by Dr. Gilberto Fragoso in May, 1991, reached the same conclusions.  Notes from claimant's out- patient visits to a local mental health center indicate that he reported in January, 1990 that he was \"functioning adequately with medications\" and was keeping himself entertained by spending his days at a home for senior citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Miguez examined claimant in February, 1991, and reported that claimant's posture was \"unremarkable\" and that \"no movement disorders are observed.\"  He also concluded that claimant, although depressed, was \"in good contact with reality,\" coherent, relevant and functioning at \"a regular intellectual level.\"  An examining pulmonologist, Dr. Harold Pola, reported in April, 1991 that claimant's asthma was \"well controlled\" by his medication and that, by use of an inhaler, he could avoid visits to the local health center.  Based upon the above evidence, we conclude that there is substantial support in the record for the ALJ's decision to discredit claimant's subjective allegations of the disabling extent of his medical conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues on appeal that the environmental restrictions that his asthma placed on his ability to work should have resulted in a finding that he was disabled prior to November 21, 1991.  Claimant relies upon the following comment in Social Security Ruling No. 85-15:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an individual can tolerate very little noise, dust, etc., the impact on the ability to work would be considerable because very few job environments are entirely free of irritants, pollutants, and other potentially damaging conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The physical RFC prepared by Dr. Fragoso concluded that claimant should \"avoid all exposure [to] fumes, odors, dusts, gases poor ventilation, etc.\"  The RFC completed by Dr. Marxauch, however, was less stringent, finding that claimant should \"avoid even moderate exposure\" to those irritants.  Dr. Pola reported that claimant complained that his asthmatic episodes were worsened by exposure to fuel, fumes, dust, smoke and cold temperature.  The doctor recommended that claimant \"avoid exposure\" to those substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the ALJ presented the VE with a hypothetical that included the following environmental restrictions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">this person can only work at places where there is a clean environment, free of strong odors, dust, gas and in places where ventilation is adequate, ... should avoid extreme temperatures, cold or hot and in addition the person should avoid humid places and places where the relative humidity is high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering these and other non-environmental restrictions, the VE testified that there were at least three jobs existing in the local economy that claimant could perform, all within the electronic and electric products manufacturing industry:  wire cutter, stamper and wire worker.  The VE's testimony was based upon a hypothetical that \"correspond[s] to conclusions supported by ... medical authorities,\" Arocho v. Secretary of  Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399275\"><a href=\"/opinion/399275/bienvenido-arocho-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir. 1982).  Therefore, his testimony was relevant and supported the Secretary's finding that claimant was not disabled prior to November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment affirming the Secretary's denial of benefits for the period prior to November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
