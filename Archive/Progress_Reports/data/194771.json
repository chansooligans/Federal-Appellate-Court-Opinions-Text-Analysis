Claimant appellant  Julio Santiago-\n                    \n\nJimenez filed an  application for social security  disability\n\nbenefits  in June,  1986.   He alleged  an inability  to work\n\nbeginning January,  1986, due to  a cardiovascular condition.\n\nClaimant was 37  years old on the date of alleged onset.  His\n\nmost recent employment had been as a laborer and packer, jobs\n\nwhich required heavy physical exertion.  \n\n          There have  been two  evidentiary hearings  in this\n\ncase.  At the first  hearing on December 16, 1987, appellant,\n\nhis   wife,   and   a  medical   advisor   testified.     The\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") held appellant not  disabled\n\nat  step  five of  the  sequential evaluation  process.   See\n                                                             \n\nGoodermote v.  Secretary of  HHS, 690 F.2d  5, 6-7  (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1982).  Specifically, the ALJ found that while  appellant had\n\na  severe impairment  which  precluded  return  to  his  past\n\nrelevant  work,  he nevertheless  had  a  residual functional\n\ncapacity for the  full range of light work  jobs available in\n\nthe  economy.    The  ALJ's  functional  capacity assessment,\n\nhowever,  had been made without the assistance of a qualified\n\nphysician.   On appeal  to the district  court, the  case was\n\nremanded  to the  ALJ for further  consideration in  light of\n\nthis  court's previous  decisions.    See Rivera-Figueroa  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of  HHS, 858 F.2d  48, 52 (1st Cir.  1988); Rivera-\n                                                             \n\nTorres v. Secretary of HHS, 837 F.2d  4, 7 (1st Cir. 1988) (a\n                          \n\n                             -2-\n\nlay  fact-finder is  not  qualified  to determine  functional\n\ncapacity solely on the basis of bare medical findings).  \n\n          On  remand, the ALJ held a supplementary hearing at\n\nwhich he heard  more testimony from claimant, as  well as the\n\ntestimony  of a  second  medical  advisor  and  a  vocational\n\nexpert.   On the basis  of the  entire record,  the ALJ  then\n\nconcluded that  appellant retained  a capacity  for sedentary\n\njobs which  existed in significant numbers in the economy, as\n\nwell as one or two positions identified as \"light\" work jobs.\n\nAppellant   appealed  to  the  district  court  again.    The\n\nmagistrate-judge issued  a report recommending  affirmance of\n\nthe  ALJ's  decision.     The  district  court   adopted  the\n\nmagistrate's   report  and   recommendation,  affirming   the\n\nSecretary.  This appeal followed.  We, too, affirm.\n\n          We are met at the  outset with an argument from the\n\nSecretary  that  the  appeal  should   be  dismissed  because\n\nappellant allegedly failed  to file timely objections  to the\n\nmagistrate's report in the  district court.  Failure  to file\n\nspecific  objections to a magistrate's report within the time\n\nallowed  ordinarily waives the  right to appeal  the district\n\ncourt's order.   Thomas v.  Arn, 474 U.S. 140  (1985); United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Valencia-Copete,  792  F.2d  4  (1st  Cir.  1986).\n                          \n\nAppellant's  alleged  late  filing  in  this  case,  however,\n\ncontained specific objections  to the report,  as well as  an\n\nassertion that  he  had received  the  report only  six  days\n\n                             -3-\n\nearlier.     The  Secretary  did  not   challenge  claimant's\n\nassertion of  late notice in  the court below, nor  object in\n\nany way to the district court's consideration of the  merits.\n\nThe district  judge adopted the  magistrate's report  without\n\nreference to the timeliness of  the objections.  We thus have\n\nno  reason  to  consider the  Secretary's  belated procedural\n\nchallenge here.  \n\n          Appellant's argument on the merits is confined to a\n\nsingle issue:  whether the ALJ correctly determined on remand\n\nthat  appellant  is  capable  of  performing sedentary  work,\n\ndespite  evidence that he suffers from occasional episodes of\n\nchest pain.  On this review our task is to determine  whether\n\nthe  Secretary's  findings   are  supported  by  \"substantial\n\nevidence.\"   Although the record  may support  more than  one\n\nconclusion,  we uphold the Secretary when \"a reasonable mind,\n\nreviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, could accept\n\nit  as  adequate  to  support  his  conclusion.\"    Ortiz  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of HHS, 955 F.2d  765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991), quoting\n                \n\nRodriguez v.

Resolutions of conflicts in the evidence are for the\n\nSecretary.  Ortiz, 955 F.2d  at 769; Evangelista v.

Where the  facts\n      \n\npermit  diverse inferences, we  will affirm the  Secretary so\n\nlong as the inferences drawn  are supported by the  evidence.\n\n                             -4-\n\nRodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of HHS, 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1987),  cert.  denied,  484  U.S.  1012  (1988);  Lizotte  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of HHS, 654 F.2d 127, 128 (1st Cir. 1981).\n                \n\n          Using the criteria for the evaluation of complaints\n\nof pain set forth in Avery  v. Secretary of HHS, 797 F.2d  19\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986),  the  ALJ  determined  that  the  objective\n\nmedical  findings   in  the   record  did   not  substantiate\n\nappellant's  claims  of  functionally limiting  pain  to  the\n\ndegree   alleged.    There   was  ample  evidence   for  this\n\nconclusion.    While  appellant's  chest  condition had  been\n\nvariously  diagnosed, both  medical  advisors testified  that\n\nclaimant's pain  was not ischemic in nature,  but was instead\n\nassociated  with  costochondritis,  an  inflammation  of  the\n\ncartilage connecting  the ribs to  the sternum.   They stated\n\nthat  the  condition  is treatable  with  steroids  and anti-\n\ninflammatory  medications.   While costochondritis  can cause\n\nsevere  pain,  both  medical  advisors  concluded   that  the\n\ndiagnosis  alone  did not  dictate  a medical  basis  for the\n\nfrequency  and  degree of  functionally  limiting pain  which\n\nappellant alleged. \n\n          At the supplementary  hearing, the medical  advisor\n\nalso testified that, despite  appellant's chest condition, he\n\nretained a functional capacity for sedentary work.  Appellant\n\nwas found able to  lift ten pounds, sit and stand  for six to\n\neight  hours at  a time,  and change  positions.   The expert\n\n                             -5-\n\nbased his  opinion on all  of the medical records  and tests,\n\nexpressly    including    consideration     of    appellant's\n\ncostochondritis  as  well  as   his  occasional  tachycardia,\n\ncontrolled hypertension, pain, and the effects of appellant's\n\nvarious  medications.     While  the  expert   conceded  that\n\nappellant  would  be unable  to  work during  any  episode of\n\nuncontrolled severe pain,  which might occur on  average once\n\nper week, he stated that such  an episode would be of limited\n\nduration, lasting no more than one hour.  He based the latter\n\nestimate  largely  on  appellant's own  testimony  as  to the\n\neffectiveness  of prescribed  medication  in controlling  his\n\npain.  \n\n          The  vocational   expert  also  testified   to  the\n\nexistence of a series of jobs which a person with appellant's\n\nskills and stamina could perform, despite occasional episodes\n\nof severe  pain.  In  sum, there was substantial  evidence to\n\nsupport the ALJ's conclusion that claimant was \"not disabled\"\n\nat step five.             Appellant  argues   that  the   ALJ\n\nshould, instead, have  credited appellant's testimony  to the\n\neffect  that  he  suffered much  more  frequent  (even daily)\n\ndebilitating  bouts of  pain.  Both  the medical  advisor and\n\nvocational  expert agreed that  if appellant's bouts  of pain\n\nwere as severe and frequent as he claimed, appellant would be\n\nunable to perform any sedentary job in the economy.  However,\n\nevaluation of  the credibility of  unsubstantiated subjective\n\n                             -6-\n\nreports of pain is for the Secretary -- not the courts  -- to\n\nresolve.

Secretary  of HHS, 826 F.2d 136 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1987). \"The credibility  determination by the  ALJ, who\n\nobserved the claimant, evaluated his demeanor, and considered\n\nhow that testimony  fit in with the rest of  the evidence, is\n\nentitled to  deference, especially when supported by specific\n\nfindings.\"  Frustaglia v. Secretary of \n                                       \n\nHHS, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).\n   \n\n          Accordingly, the decision below is affirmed.    \n                                                     \n\n                             -7-\n",

The  Secretary  did  not   challenge  claimant's\n\nassertion of  late notice in  the court below, nor  object in\n\nany way to the district court's consideration of the  merits.\n\nThe district  judge adopted the  magistrate's report  without\n\nreference to the timeliness of  the objections.  We thus have\n\nno  reason  to  consider the  Secretary's  belated procedural\n\nchallenge here.  \n\n          Appellant's argument on the merits is confined to a\n\nsingle issue:  whether the ALJ correctly determined on remand\n\nthat  appellant  is  capable  of  performing sedentary  work,\n\ndespite  evidence that he suffers from occasional episodes of\n\nchest pain.

Secretary of HHS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986),  the  ALJ  determined  that  the  objective\n\nmedical  findings   in  the   record  did   not  substantiate\n\nappellant's  claims  of  functionally limiting  pain  to  the\n\ndegree   alleged.    There   was  ample  evidence   for  this\n\nconclusion.    While  appellant's  chest  condition had  been\n\nvariously  diagnosed, both  medical  advisors testified  that\n\nclaimant's pain  was not ischemic in nature,  but was instead\n\nassociated  with  costochondritis,  an  inflammation  of  the\n\ncartilage connecting  the ribs to  the sternum.   They stated\n\nthat  the  condition  is treatable  with  steroids  and anti-\n\ninflammatory  medications.   While costochondritis  can cause\n\nsevere  pain,  both  medical  advisors  concluded   that  the\n\ndiagnosis  alone  did not  dictate  a medical  basis  for the\n\nfrequency  and  degree of  functionally  limiting pain  which\n\nappellant alleged. \n\n          At the supplementary  hearing, the medical  advisor\n\nalso testified that, despite  appellant's chest condition, he\n\nretained a functional capacity for sedentary work.  Appellant\n\nwas found able to  lift ten pounds, sit and stand  for six to\n\neight  hours at  a time,  and change  positions.   The expert\n\n                             -5-\n\nbased his  opinion on all  of the medical records  and tests,\n\nexpressly    including    consideration     of    appellant's\n\ncostochondritis  as  well  as   his  occasional  tachycardia,\n\ncontrolled hypertension, pain, and the effects of appellant's\n\nvarious  medications.     While  the  expert   conceded  that\n\nappellant  would  be unable  to  work during  any  episode of\n\nuncontrolled severe pain,  which might occur on  average once\n\nper week, he stated that such  an episode would be of limited\n\nduration, lasting no more than one hour.  He based the latter\n\nestimate  largely  on  appellant's own  testimony  as  to the\n\neffectiveness  of prescribed  medication  in controlling  his\n\npain.  \n\n          The  vocational   expert  also  testified   to  the\n\nexistence of a series of jobs which a person with appellant's\n\nskills and stamina could perform, despite occasional episodes\n\nof severe  pain.  In  sum, there was substantial  evidence to\n\nsupport the ALJ's conclusion that claimant was \"not disabled\"\n\nat step five.             Appellant  argues   that  the   ALJ\n\nshould, instead, have  credited appellant's testimony  to the\n\neffect  that  he  suffered much  more  frequent  (even daily)\n\ndebilitating  bouts of  pain.  Both  the medical  advisor and\n\nvocational  expert agreed that  if appellant's bouts  of pain\n\nwere as severe and frequent as he claimed, appellant would be\n\nunable to perform any sedentary job in the economy.  However,\n\nevaluation of  the credibility of  unsubstantiated subjective\n\n                             -6-\n\nreports of pain is for the Secretary -- not the courts  -- to\n\nresolve.
