In  these  consolidated\n                                 \n\nappeals,  Dorothy L.  McMurray  and Homer  F. McMurray  (\"the\n\nMcMurrays\"),  challenge decisions  of  the United  States Tax\n\nCourt which upheld determinations made by the Commissioner of\n\nInternal Revenue  (\"the Commissioner\") that the McMurrays are\n\njointly liable  for income tax deficiencies  for 1984 through\n\n1988, as well as  penalties stemming from those deficiencies.\n\nThe deficiencies are  based on the Commissioner's  conclusion\n\nthat the McMurrays overstated the value of certain charitable\n\nland donations.  For  the reasons that follow, we  affirm the\n\ndeficiency determinations,  but  reverse  a  portion  of  the\n\npenalty assessments.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          The central  issue in this  case is  the amount  of\n\ncharitable deduction to which the McMurrays are entitled as a\n\nresult  of donating property  known as  the Ponemah  Bog,1 in\n\nAmherst, New Hampshire (\"the Bog\"), to the Audubon Society of\n\nNew Hampshire  (\"Audubon\").   The McMurrays, who  are husband\n\n                    \n\n1.  Ponemah is a  \"kettle hole\" bog, formed by  glaciers over\n12,000 years ago.   As the   climate warmed and the  glaciers\nreceded, vegetation grew on the edges of a pond formed by the\nmelting blocks of ice.   Although the  pond was too deep  and\nsteep-sided to  support the  growth  of many  types of  marsh\nplants, some, such as sphagnum (peat) moss, were able to grow\nout  over the  edge of  the pond  and float  on the  surface.\nEventually, a peat  mat formed on  the surface, which  became\nthick enough to support  shrubs and stunted trees.   Over the\ncourse  of thousands of years, the pond gradually filled with\npeat and the remains of dead vegetation.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nand wife, in 1954 acquired the  approximately 72-acre Bog and\n\nother contiguous parcels of land.\n\n          In  February  1978,   Audubon  solicited  from  the\n\nMcMurrays2  a donation  of the  Bog, in  order to  ensure its\n\nperpetual preservation.   The McMurrays agreed,  and in 1979,\n\n1982  and 1985  conveyed their  interests in  the Bog  and an\n\nabutting  residential  lot to  the  Audubon  Society in  four\n\nseparate  transactions.  Only the  value of the  1982 and two\n\n1985 conveyances are at issue in this case.\n\n          In 1979,  the McMurrays conveyed  the eastern  24.6\n\nacres of  the Bog to Audubon.   In April 1982,  the McMurrays\n\nconveyed a 65  percent interest in the  remaining 47.57 acres\n\nof the  Bog.   On  their joint federal income  tax return for\n\n1982, the  McMurrays claimed  that the  fair market  value of\n\ntheir contribution to Audubon was $780,000.  They  based this\n\nvaluation on a \"letter of opinion\" from appraiser Patricia J.\n\nDonovon, who  concluded  that the  fair market  value of  the\n\nproperty was $25,000 to $27,000 per acre, or between $750,000\n\nand $800,000.  The McMurrays took a $118,981 deduction on the\n\n1982 return,  and calculated  that $349,019 would  be carried\n\nover to future years. \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  record  indicates that  Homer  F.  McMurray was  the\nprincipal  actor in all  Bog-related transactions.   However,\nbecause  their joint-taxpayer  status  places both  McMurrays\nbefore us, we refer  to all actions as though  they were done\njointly.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          In September 1985,  after carrying over  deductions\n\nof  $122,458 and  $117,721, respectively,  on their  1983 and\n\n1984 returns, the McMurrays conveyed to Audubon the remaining\n\n35  percent  interest in  the Bog.    In December  1985, they\n\ntransferred  a one acre residential lot abutting the Bog.  In\n\nMarch 1986, Donovon provided  the McMurrays with an appraisal\n\nfor  the two 1985 donations.  Donovon increased the price per\n\nacre to $35,000, and concluded  that the 35 percent  interest\n\nin  the  Bog  had  a  value  of  $580,000.   She  valued  the\n\nresidential lot at $55,000  to $60,000, resulting in  a total\n\n1985 charitable conveyance value of $635,000 to $640,000.\n\n          On their 1985 return, the McMurrays claimed a value\n\nof  $637,500  for  the  donated  property.    They  used  the\n\nremaining  $123,200 carryover  from  the  1982 donation,  and\n\nclaimed $10,636 from the 1985 transfers on their 1985 return,\n\nleaving   a  $371,864  carryover.     The  McMurrays  claimed\n\ndeductions of $170,597 in 1986, $135,115 in 1987, and $76,788\n\nin 1988.\n\n     Upon conducting an examination of the McMurrays' returns\n\nfor 1984, 1985 and 1986, the Commissioner determined that the\n\nfair market value of the  1982 conveyance was $23,200, rather\n\nthan $780,000,  as the  McMurrays claimed.   Accordingly, the\n\nCommissioner ruled that  there was no carryover  from 1982 to\n\neither  1983 or  1984,  and thus  no deduction  allowable for\n\n1984.  The Commissioner also ruled that the fair market value\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nof  the 1985  Bog  transfer was  $6,250,  as opposed  to  the\n\n$580,000 the  McMurrays claimed;  and that the  value of  the\n\nresidential lot transferred the  same year was $35,000 rather\n\nthan  $57,500, as claimed by  the McMurrays.   Based on these\n\nfigures, the  Commissioner determined that the McMurrays were\n\nentitled  to  a  1985  deduction  of  $24,750,  and  that  no\n\ncarryovers  were  available  for  future years.    Thus,  the\n\nCommissioner found deficiencies for 1984, 1985 and 1986.  The\n\nCommissioner also  asserted additions  to tax under  I.R.C.  \n\n6653 for  negligence and  intentional disregard of  rules and\n\nregulations,  and under I.R.C.   6659 for underpayment of tax\n\nattributable to  a charitable  valuation overstatement.   The\n\nCommissioner  subsequently  determined  tax deficiencies  for\n\n1987 and 1988,  as well  as additions to  tax under  sections\n\n6653 and 6659.3\n\n                    \n\n3.

On  March 19,  1992, the  tax court\n\nruled against the McMurrays (Appeal No. 92-1513).  Meanwhile,\n\nin March  1991, the  McMurrays had sought  redetermination of\n\ntheir  1987 and 1988 deficiencies.   The Commissioner filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment  in the 1991-filed case, claiming\n\nthat the McMurrays were collaterally estopped by the decision\n\nin the  1990 case  from relitigating the  1985 contributions.\n\nOn April 23, 1992,  the tax court granted  the Commissioner's\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment  (Appeal No.  92-1628).   These\n\nappeals followed.4\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.  The Deficiencies\n                    \n\n          Section 170  of  the Internal  Revenue  Code  (\"the\n\nCode\")  allows taxpayers  to deduct  charitable contributions\n\nsubject to percentage-of-income  limitations and to carryover\n\nexcess contributions.   If a charitable  contribution is made\n\nof  property other than money, the amount of the contribution\n\nis the fair  market value of the property at  the time of the\n\ncontribution.   Treas.  Reg.    1.170A-1(c)(1).   Fair market\n\nvalue  is \"the price at which the property would change hands\n\n                    \n\n4.  In  their  reply  brief,  the  McMurrays  indicate  their\nabandonment  of the  collateral  estoppel issue.   Thus,  our\ndecision here will apply to both cases.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nbetween a willing buyer  and a willing seller,  neither being\n\nunder  any compulsion  to  buy or  sell,  and both  having  a\n\nreasonable  knowledge  of relevant  facts.\"    Treas. Reg.   \n\n1.170A-1(c)(2).  The Commissioner's determination of the fair\n\nmarket value  of donated  property is presumptively  correct,\n\nand the taxpayer has the burden of proving the Commissioner's\n\ndetermination to be  erroneous.  Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n111, 115  (1933); Pescosolido v.

The  fair market value of property is a\n\nreflection of the \"highest  and best use\" of the  property on\n\nthe  date of valuation.   Symington v.  Commissioner, 87 T.C.\n                                                    \n\n892, 896 (1986); Stanley Works  v.

The tax  court's ruling  with respect  to fair\n\nmarket  value is a factual finding that we must affirm unless\n\nit  is clearly erroneous.  Sammons  v. Commissioner, 838 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n330, 333  (9th Cir.  1988); Ebben  v.

The McMurrays, however,\n\nbelieve the commercial value of the peat contained in the Bog\n\nshould be taken into  account in any valuation.5   In support\n\nof  their theory,  the McMurrays submitted  to the  tax court\n\nappraisals  by  Boston  College  Coastal  Research  Institute\n\n                    \n\n5.  According  to record evidence, peat can be used as a fuel\nsource for electric power generation.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nProfessor  Dr. Benno  Brenninkmeyer, Richard  Kasevich, chief\n\nfinancial  officer  of  a  Maine  peat-mining operation,  and\n\nbotany professor  Ian Worley.6   Brenninkmeyer estimated  the\n\nvalue  of the  peat in  the Bog,  as a  fuel resource,  to be\n\ngreater  than  $35  million;  Worley  calculated  the  profit\n\npotential  of harvesting  the peat;  Kasevich compiled  a pro\n                                                             \n\nforma income  statement demonstrating the profitability  of a\n     \n\nhypothetical harvesting operation on the Bog.\n\n          Before  the  tax  court,  the  Commissioner  relied\n\nexclusively for the valuation of the gift on the appraisal of\n\nJoseph  G. Fremeau.  After giving much weight to the presence\n\nof state and local zoning restrictions on the use of the Bog,\n\nand interviewing several people  involved in the variance and\n\npermitting  process, Fremeau  opined that  any request  for a\n\npermit to harvest the peat or otherwise develop the Bog would\n\nhave met  substantial  opposition during  the  relevant  time\n\nperiod  and   would  have  had  little   chance  of  success.\n\nAccordingly,  Fremeau's valuation  focused on sale  prices of\n\neight other supposedly comparable wetland properties suitable\n\nfor  conservation  purposes  and  which had  sold  at  prices\n\n                    \n\n6.  Although the Tax Court considered the Donovon  appraisals\naccompanying the McMurrays' tax returns  as part of the  peat\nvaluation theory,  it is  evident  from the  record that  the\nMcMurrays  essentially abandoned  reliance on  Donovon before\nthe  Tax Court  and included  her appraisal  only as  part of\ntheir  argument  against penalties,  see  infra.   Thus,  for\n                                               \npurposes of  our examination of the  peat valuation evidence,\nwe  discuss  neither  Donovon's  work, nor  the  Tax  Court's\ncriticism thereof.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nbetween $200 and $800  per acre.  Fremeau concluded  that the\n\nBog had a value of $400 per  acre, for a total of $12,500 for\n\nthe  1982 transfer, and $6,700  for the 1985  transfer.  With\n\nrespect  to  the   residential  lot,  Fremeau   evaluated  20\n\ncomparable sales and  found a  range in the  Amherst area  of\n\n$22,533 to $58,000.   As the lot in question is  smaller than\n\nmany other Amherst house  lots and is encumbered by  a right-\n\nof-way easement owned by Audubon, Fremeau's $35,000 valuation\n\nfell toward the lower end of the scale.\n\n          In  the end,  the  tax court  found the  McMurrays'\n\nevidence  inadequate because,  unlike Fremeau, none  of their\n\nexperts took into account  the restrictions on harvesting the\n\npeat or the costs  associated with such an operation.   Thus,\n\nthe court concluded that the  McMurrays failed to carry their\n\nburden  of proving  that the  value of  the Bog  exceeded the\n\nCommissioner's  determination.    Based  on  our   review  of\n\npertinent  case law, we cannot say the tax court's ruling was\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n          It  is well  settled  that  legal  restrictions  on\n\ndevelopment or other encumbrances  diminish a property's fair\n\nmarket value.   For example, in Great  Northern Nekoosa Corp.\n                                                             \n\nv.

Prior to  the donation, however,\n\nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 82 Stat. 906 (1968),\n\nwas  enacted,  which  could  have barred,  inter  alia,  such\n                                                      \n\nconstruction,   a  fact  not  considered  by  the  taxpayer's\n\nappraisal.  We concluded  that the taxpayer's valuation could\n\nnot be  the  fair  market  value \"inasmuch  as  any  rational\n\nprospective purchase would necessarily  take into account the\n\npotential  realization of  that  encumbrance.\"   Id. at  475.\n                                                    \n\nTherefore--despite our  less than complete  satisfaction with\n\nthe  Commissioner's expert  appraisal--we concluded  that the\n\ntaxpayer failed  to bear  its burden of  proving a  valuation\n\nhigher than that of the Commissioner.\n\n          Here, too, we have  a taxpayer appraisal that fails\n\nto consider  potential legal obstacles toward  fulfilling the\n\nproperty's  full  monetary  potential.     Moreover,  as  the\n\nCommissioner  points out, the  McMurrays' experts also failed\n\nto  consider many other aspects of a peat mining operation in\n\narriving at their conclusion.7   Thus, given the shortcomings\n\n                    \n\n7.  For   example,  Brenninkmeyer  reached  his  $35  million\nconclusion by multiplying the  Bog's estimated volume by $145\nper ton, which was the average  retail price of coal in 1989.\nHe  failed, however, to assess the market for peat during the\nrelevant  time period,  or  the costs  and  feasibility of  a\ncomplete peat  extraction.   Kasevich's income  statement was\nbased on the 1990 peat harvesting figures of his own company,\nbut did  not include any  potential overhead costs.   Worley,\nrelying  on  Kasevich's  income  statement,  assumed, without\nfactual  support,  that  all  equipment  could  be  purchased\noutright,  and   thus  did  not  consider   financing  costs.\nSignificantly, both  Kasevich and Worley alluded  to the fact\nthat successes in  the peat harvesting business were few, and\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof  the  McMurrays'   experts'  reports,   the  tax   court's\n\nconclusion that  the McMurrays  failed to carry  their burden\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n          In the  alternative, the  McMurrays  argue that  if\n\nstate and  local regulatory  constraints deprive them  of the\n\nBog's  economic potential,  then  they are  entitled to  just\n\ncompensation under  the United States Constitution  in return\n\nfor a regulatory taking.  See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal\n                                                             \n\nCouncil,     U.S.    , 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992).  Even assuming\n                     \n\nthat Lucas would  turn the regulations  involved here into  a\n          \n\n\"taking,\"  the  short  answer  is  that  the  McMurrays  have\n\noverlooked the fact  that any such \"taking\"  was performed by\n\nstate  and local authorities, and as such gives them no right\n\nto seek  compensation--via  tax deductions--from  the  United\n\nStates, an  entirely different  sovereign.  Moreover,  to the\n\nextent that the McMurrays argue for including the value of an\n\ninverse condemnation suit against  the State of New Hampshire\n\nin the  Bog valuation, the tax court correctly concluded that\n\nthe success of such a suit is not as assured as the McMurrays\n\ndeclare, and  that  the record  is  \"devoid of  any  evidence\n\n                    \n\nthat  most of  the peat harvesting  operations of  which they\nwere aware had failed.   While Kasevich's Down East  Peat Co.\nwas an  apparent exception,  we cannot  quarrel with  the Tax\nCourt's conclusion  that  reliance on  Down East's  financial\nperformance to  estimate the McMurray's potential  success is\n\"like saying  that anybody  opens a hamburger  chain and  you\nestimate the profit potential by what McDonald's does.\"  \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndirected  toward valuing any such  claim.\"  Thus  we find the\n\ntax court did not err in rejecting this argument.\n\n          Finally, the  McMurrays argue that  the tax court's\n\nreliance on  Fremeau's use of comparative sales  to value the\n\nBog was inappropriate due to  the Bog's uniqueness.  Instead,\n\nthe McMurrays,  relying on Estate of  Palmer v. Commissioner,\n                                                            \n\n839  F.2d  420   (8th  Cir.  1988),  assert  that  the  Bog's\n\nreplacement cost would be a better method.  We disagree.  The\n\nMcMurrays, unlike  the taxpayers in Palmer,  have provided no\n                                          \n\nevidence  of replacement cost and thus we find no clear error\n\nin the tax court's  reliance on Fremeau's evaluation method.8\n\n Accordingly, we  affirm the  tax court's decision  to uphold\n\nthe Commissioner's deficiency determinations.9\n\n                    \n\n8.  While it  is true  that Fremeau's  comparative properties\nwere not identical to the Bog in some respects, the Tax Court\nfound that  they were  the most comparable  for the  relevant\ntime and  place.   See  Symington,  87 T.C.  at  900 (in  the\n                                 \nabsence  of  identical  properties, comparable  sales  method\ntakes  into  account  differences,  and  through  appropriate\nadjustment, arrives at a value for the subject property).  As\nthe  record demonstrates  that the  compared properties  were\nalso non-developable  wetlands, and that state  Fish and Game\nand Forest Protection Society personnel held  at least two of\nthe properties in  the same high esteem  as the Bog,  we find\nthe   Tax  Court's   endorsement  of   Fremeau's  methodology\neminently supportable.  See Anselmo v. Commissioner, 757 F.2d\n                                                   \n1208,  1213 (11th  Cir. 1985)  (Tax Court's  determination of\nproper  comparable market is  a question  of fact  subject to\nreversal only if clearly erroneous). \n\n9.  The McMurrays have not  addressed any appellate  argument\nto the valuation of the residential  lot transferred in 1985.\nTherefore, we deem the argument abandoned.  See, e.g., United\n                                                             \nStates  v. Slade, No. 92-1176,  slip op. at  6, n.3 (1st Cir.\n                \nNov. 24, 1992).\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nB.  Additions to Tax and Penalties\n                                  \n\n     1.  Negligence\n                   \n\n          Section  6653(a)(1) of  the  1954 Code  and Section\n\n6653(a)(1)(A) of the 1986  Code impose an addition to  tax of\n\nfive  percent of an income tax underpayment where any part of\n\nthe  underpayment   is  due  to  negligence   or  intentional\n\ndisregard of rules or regulations.  Section 6653(a)(2) of the\n\n1954  Code and Section 6653 (a)(1)(B) of the 1986 Code impose\n\na penalty of 50 percent of the interest due on the portion of\n\nany  underpayment attributable  to negligence.10   Negligence\n\nin this context is a lack of due care or failure to do what a\n\nreasonable and  ordinarily prudent person would  do under the\n\ncircumstances.  Allen v. Commissioner, 925 F.2d 348, 353 (9th\n                                     \n\nCir. 1991).   The  Commissioner's imposition of  a negligence\n\naddition is presumptively correct, leaving the McMurrays with\n\nthe  burden of proving that their underpayment was not due to\n\nnegligent  or  intentional  rules  violations.    Leuhsler v.\n                                                          \n\nCommissioner, 963 F.2d 907, 910 (6th Cir. 1992).  \n            \n\n          The McMurrays argue, as  they did below, that their\n\ngood faith  reliance on  Donovon--a professional  real estate\n\nappraiser--for the  valuations stated on their  1982 and 1985\n\nreturns justifies reversal of the extra assessment.  The  tax\n\n                    \n\n10.  The relevant statutes were renumbered for  taxable years\nin  which a  return is due  after December  31, 1986.   Their\nsubstance  remained the same, however.  See Tax Reform Act of\n                                           \n1986, Pub. L. No. 99-514,   1503(a), 100 Stat. 2085.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\ncourt, however, found that the McMurrays did not sufficiently\n\nestablish   that   they   reasonably   relied   on  Donovon's\n\nappraisals, \"beyond the bare fact that the [] appraisals were\n\nattached  to the [] returns.\"   The court  then combined four\n\nfactors--its  disparaging  view  of  Donovon's   report,  the\n\nMcMurrays'  failure to  testify as  to their  reliance, their\n\nabandonment  of her appraisals at  trial, and evidence of the\n\nMcMurrays'  knowledge  of  real  estate  development  in  the\n\nAmherst area--to conclude that they had failed to demonstrate\n\ntheir reasonable reliance.  We disagree.11\n\n          Reasonable reliance on expert opinion,  asserted in\n\ngood  faith,  can  shield  a taxpayer  from  section  6653(a)\n\npenalties.  United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 250 (1985);\n                                  \n\nCollins v. Commissioner, 857 F.2d 1383, 1386 (9th Cir. 1988);\n                       \n\nBetson v.  Commissioner, 802 F.2d  365, 372 (9th  Cir. 1986).\n                       \n\nThe record  reflects that after being  approached by Audubon,\n\nthe  McMurrays sought  professional  advice from  lawyers and\n\naccountants, as well as an appraiser.  In our view, the \"bare\n\nfact\"  that the  McMurrays attached  Donovon's  appraisals to\n\nsupport  their 1982  and 1985  returns  is evidence  of their\n                                          \n\nreliance  on the appraisals.   In other words,  why else were\n\nthey  submitted with the returns,  but for the  fact that the\n\n                    \n\n11.  It  is unclear from the record whether the Tax Court was\nquestioning  the McMurrays'  actual reliance  on Donovon,  or\nwhether any such reliance was reasonable.  With that in mind,\nwe will delve into both areas.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nMcMurrays  were relying on them?  Furthermore, we fail to see\n\nhow  any of  the other  factors cited  by  the tax  court are\n\nprobative of the McMurrays' reliance.  For instance, the fact\n\nthat the McMurrays pursued a different legal tack at trial in\n\n1991  has  little  bearing  on the  reasonableness  of  their\n\nactions in 1982 and 1985.  Also, while the McMurrays may have\n\nsome knowledge  as to  \"real estate development,\"  the record\n\nevidence of such knowledge falls far short  of requiring them\n\nto  second-guess a  licensed appraiser--especially  one whose\n\n1979 appraisal apparently passed muster with the Commissioner\n\nas  support for the deductions taken for the 1979 conveyance.\n\nFinally, we note that the minimal probative value assigned by\n\nthe  tax  court to  the  McMurrays' expert  opinion  does not\n\nmandate a finding of bad faith or unreasonable reliance.  See\n                                                             \n\nSammons,  838  F.2d   at  337  (although  taxpayer's   expert\n       \n\nappraisal  was  not  entitled  to  any  probative  weight  in\n\ndetermining   the  fair   market   value  of   a   charitable\n\ncontribution, imposing a negligence penalty was inappropriate\n\nbecause taxpayers  had no  reason to question  their expert's\n\nability) (citing  Biagiotti v. Commissioner, 52  T.C.M. (CCH)\n                                           \n\n588, 595  (1986)).  We  conclude, therefore, that  the record\n\nlacks  sufficient evidence  of bad faith  to support  the tax\n\ncourt's negligence ruling, and instead compels a finding that\n\nthe McMurrays met their burden of proof on this issue.\n\n     2.  Valuation Overstatement\n                                \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Section 6659 of the Code imposes an addition to tax\n\nif  the amount  of  any underpayment  of  $1,000 or  more  is\n\nattributable  to  a  valuation  overstatement  of  charitable\n\ndeduction  property.12    For  purposes of  this  section,  a\n\nvaluation overstatement exists where the claimed value is 150\n\npercent  or more  of  the amount  determined  to be  correct.\n\nI.R.C.   6659(c)(1).   Here, the McMurrays claimed a donation\n\nvalue  of $803,933 in 1982, and a  value of $637,500 in 1985.\n\nThe tax  court, however, ruled  that the values  were $12,500\n\nand  $41,700,   respectively.    These   figures  place   the\n\nMcMurrays'  overstatement beyond the 150 percent threshold of\n\nsection 6659.  \n\n          The  McMurrays seek  relief under  section 6659(e),\n\nwhich allows for a waiver of \"all or any part of the addition\n\nto tax provided by this section on a showing by  the taxpayer\n\nthat there  was  a  reasonable basis  for  the  valuation  or\n\nadjusted  basis claimed on the return and that such claim was\n\nmade  in good faith.\"   While we have  already concluded that\n\nthe  McMurrays acted  in reasonable  reliance on  the Donovon\n\nappraisal, the  inquiry does  not end there,  because section\n\n6659(f)(2)  prohibits a  penalty waiver  unless \"the  claimed\n\nvalue of the property was based on a qualified appraisal made\n\nby  a qualified  appraiser,\" and,  \"in addition  to obtaining\n                                \n\n                    \n\n12.  The assessed  penalty is 30 percent  of the underpayment\nattributable to the valuation overstatement.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nsuch   an  appraisal,   the  taxpayer   made  a   good  faith\n\ninvestigation  of the value of the contributed property.\"  On\n\nappeal, the McMurrays do  not address section 6659(f)(2), nor\n\ndoes  our  review  of  the  record  indicate  any  additional\n\ninvestigation  by  the  McMurrays   into  the  value  of  the\n\nproperty.  Thus, we affirm the imposition of  penalties under\n\nsection 6659.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          The  tax  court's  decision  with  respect  to  the\n\nCommissioner's deficiency determination and additions  to tax\n\nunder I.R.C.   6659  is affirmed.  The decision  with respect\n                        affirmed\n                                \n\nto  the  negligence  penalties  under  I.R.C.     6653(a)  is\n\nreversed.

For  the reasons that follow, we  affirm the\n\ndeficiency determinations,  but  reverse  a  portion  of  the\n\npenalty assessments.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          The central  issue in this  case is  the amount  of\n\ncharitable deduction to which the McMurrays are entitled as a\n\nresult  of donating property  known as  the Ponemah  Bog,1 in\n\nAmherst, New Hampshire (\"the Bog\"), to the Audubon Society of\n\nNew Hampshire  (\"Audubon\").   The McMurrays, who  are husband\n\n                    \n\n1.  Ponemah is a  \"kettle hole\" bog, formed by  glaciers over\n12,000 years ago.   As the   climate warmed and the  glaciers\nreceded, vegetation grew on the edges of a pond formed by the\nmelting blocks of ice.   Although the  pond was too deep  and\nsteep-sided to  support the  growth  of many  types of  marsh\nplants, some, such as sphagnum (peat) moss, were able to grow\nout  over the  edge of  the pond  and float  on the  surface.\nEventually, a peat  mat formed on  the surface, which  became\nthick enough to support  shrubs and stunted trees.   Over the\ncourse  of thousands of years, the pond gradually filled with\npeat and the remains of dead vegetation.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nand wife, in 1954 acquired the  approximately 72-acre Bog and\n\nother contiguous parcels of land.\n\n          In  February  1978,   Audubon  solicited  from  the\n\nMcMurrays2  a donation  of the  Bog, in  order to  ensure its\n\nperpetual preservation.   The McMurrays agreed,  and in 1979,\n\n1982  and 1985  conveyed their  interests in  the Bog  and an\n\nabutting  residential  lot to  the  Audubon  Society in  four\n\nseparate  transactions.  Only the  value of the  1982 and two\n\n1985 conveyances are at issue in this case.\n\n          In 1979,  the McMurrays conveyed  the eastern  24.6\n\nacres of  the Bog to Audubon.   In April 1982,  the McMurrays\n\nconveyed a 65  percent interest in the  remaining 47.57 acres\n\nof the  Bog.   On  their joint federal income  tax return for\n\n1982, the  McMurrays claimed  that the  fair market  value of\n\ntheir contribution to Audubon was $780,000.  They  based this\n\nvaluation on a \"letter of opinion\" from appraiser Patricia J.\n\nDonovon, who  concluded  that the  fair market  value of  the\n\nproperty was $25,000 to $27,000 per acre, or between $750,000\n\nand $800,000.  The McMurrays took a $118,981 deduction on the\n\n1982 return,  and calculated  that $349,019 would  be carried\n\nover to future years. \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  record  indicates that  Homer  F.  McMurray was  the\nprincipal  actor in all  Bog-related transactions.   However,\nbecause  their joint-taxpayer  status  places both  McMurrays\nbefore us, we refer  to all actions as though  they were done\njointly.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          In September 1985,  after carrying over  deductions\n\nof  $122,458 and  $117,721, respectively,  on their  1983 and\n\n1984 returns, the McMurrays conveyed to Audubon the remaining\n\n35  percent  interest in  the Bog.    In December  1985, they\n\ntransferred  a one acre residential lot abutting the Bog.  In\n\nMarch 1986, Donovon provided  the McMurrays with an appraisal\n\nfor  the two 1985 donations.  Donovon increased the price per\n\nacre to $35,000, and concluded  that the 35 percent  interest\n\nin  the  Bog  had  a  value  of  $580,000.   She  valued  the\n\nresidential lot at $55,000  to $60,000, resulting in  a total\n\n1985 charitable conveyance value of $635,000 to $640,000.\n\n          On their 1985 return, the McMurrays claimed a value\n\nof  $637,500  for  the  donated  property.    They  used  the\n\nremaining  $123,200 carryover  from  the  1982 donation,  and\n\nclaimed $10,636 from the 1985 transfers on their 1985 return,\n\nleaving   a  $371,864  carryover.     The  McMurrays  claimed\n\ndeductions of $170,597 in 1986, $135,115 in 1987, and $76,788\n\nin 1988.\n\n     Upon conducting an examination of the McMurrays' returns\n\nfor 1984, 1985 and 1986, the Commissioner determined that the\n\nfair market value of the  1982 conveyance was $23,200, rather\n\nthan $780,000,  as the  McMurrays claimed.   Accordingly, the\n\nCommissioner ruled that  there was no carryover  from 1982 to\n\neither  1983 or  1984,  and thus  no deduction  allowable for\n\n1984.  The Commissioner also ruled that the fair market value\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nof  the 1985  Bog  transfer was  $6,250,  as opposed  to  the\n\n$580,000 the  McMurrays claimed;  and that the  value of  the\n\nresidential lot transferred the  same year was $35,000 rather\n\nthan  $57,500, as claimed by  the McMurrays.   Based on these\n\nfigures, the  Commissioner determined that the McMurrays were\n\nentitled  to  a  1985  deduction  of  $24,750,  and  that  no\n\ncarryovers  were  available  for  future years.    Thus,  the\n\nCommissioner found deficiencies for 1984, 1985 and 1986.  The\n\nCommissioner also  asserted additions  to tax under  I.R.C.  \n\n6653 for  negligence and  intentional disregard of  rules and\n\nregulations,  and under I.R.C.   6659 for underpayment of tax\n\nattributable to  a charitable  valuation overstatement.   The\n\nCommissioner  subsequently  determined  tax deficiencies  for\n\n1987 and 1988,  as well  as additions to  tax under  sections\n\n6653 and 6659.3\n\n                    \n\n3.

On  March 19,  1992, the  tax court\n\nruled against the McMurrays (Appeal No. 92-1513).  Meanwhile,\n\nin March  1991, the  McMurrays had sought  redetermination of\n\ntheir  1987 and 1988 deficiencies.   The Commissioner filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment  in the 1991-filed case, claiming\n\nthat the McMurrays were collaterally estopped by the decision\n\nin the  1990 case  from relitigating the  1985 contributions.\n\nOn April 23, 1992,  the tax court granted  the Commissioner's\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment  (Appeal No.  92-1628).

The McMurrays, however,\n\nbelieve the commercial value of the peat contained in the Bog\n\nshould be taken into  account in any valuation.5   In support\n\nof  their theory,  the McMurrays submitted  to the  tax court\n\nappraisals  by  Boston  College  Coastal  Research  Institute\n\n                    \n\n5.  According  to record evidence, peat can be used as a fuel\nsource for electric power generation.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nProfessor  Dr. Benno  Brenninkmeyer, Richard  Kasevich, chief\n\nfinancial  officer  of  a  Maine  peat-mining operation,  and\n\nbotany professor  Ian Worley.6   Brenninkmeyer estimated  the\n\nvalue  of the  peat in  the Bog,  as a  fuel resource,  to be\n\ngreater  than  $35  million;  Worley  calculated  the  profit\n\npotential  of harvesting  the peat;  Kasevich compiled  a pro\n                                                             \n\nforma income  statement demonstrating the profitability  of a\n     \n\nhypothetical harvesting operation on the Bog.\n\n          Before  the  tax  court,  the  Commissioner  relied\n\nexclusively for the valuation of the gift on the appraisal of\n\nJoseph  G. Fremeau.  After giving much weight to the presence\n\nof state and local zoning restrictions on the use of the Bog,\n\nand interviewing several people  involved in the variance and\n\npermitting  process, Fremeau  opined that  any request  for a\n\npermit to harvest the peat or otherwise develop the Bog would\n\nhave met  substantial  opposition during  the  relevant  time\n\nperiod  and   would  have  had  little   chance  of  success.\n\nAccordingly,  Fremeau's valuation  focused on sale  prices of\n\neight other supposedly comparable wetland properties suitable\n\nfor  conservation  purposes  and  which had  sold  at  prices\n\n                    \n\n6.  Although the Tax Court considered the Donovon  appraisals\naccompanying the McMurrays' tax returns  as part of the  peat\nvaluation theory,  it is  evident  from the  record that  the\nMcMurrays  essentially abandoned  reliance on  Donovon before\nthe  Tax Court  and included  her appraisal  only as  part of\ntheir  argument  against penalties,  see  infra.   Thus,  for\n                                               \npurposes of  our examination of the  peat valuation evidence,\nwe  discuss  neither  Donovon's  work, nor  the  Tax  Court's\ncriticism thereof.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nbetween $200 and $800  per acre.  Fremeau concluded  that the\n\nBog had a value of $400 per  acre, for a total of $12,500 for\n\nthe  1982 transfer, and $6,700  for the 1985  transfer.  With\n\nrespect  to  the   residential  lot,  Fremeau   evaluated  20\n\ncomparable sales and  found a  range in the  Amherst area  of\n\n$22,533 to $58,000.   As the lot in question is  smaller than\n\nmany other Amherst house  lots and is encumbered by  a right-\n\nof-way easement owned by Audubon, Fremeau's $35,000 valuation\n\nfell toward the lower end of the scale.\n\n          In  the end,  the  tax court  found the  McMurrays'\n\nevidence  inadequate because,  unlike Fremeau, none  of their\n\nexperts took into account  the restrictions on harvesting the\n\npeat or the costs  associated with such an operation.   Thus,\n\nthe court concluded that the  McMurrays failed to carry their\n\nburden  of proving  that the  value of  the Bog  exceeded the\n\nCommissioner's  determination.    Based  on  our   review  of\n\npertinent  case law, we cannot say the tax court's ruling was\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n          It  is well  settled  that  legal  restrictions  on\n\ndevelopment or other encumbrances  diminish a property's fair\n\nmarket value.   For example, in Great  Northern Nekoosa Corp.\n                                                             \n\nv.

Prior to  the donation, however,\n\nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 82 Stat. 906 (1968),\n\nwas  enacted,  which  could  have barred,  inter  alia,  such\n                                                      \n\nconstruction,   a  fact  not  considered  by  the  taxpayer's\n\nappraisal.  We concluded  that the taxpayer's valuation could\n\nnot be  the  fair  market  value \"inasmuch  as  any  rational\n\nprospective purchase would necessarily  take into account the\n\npotential  realization of  that  encumbrance.\"   Id. at  475.\n                                                    \n\nTherefore--despite our  less than complete  satisfaction with\n\nthe  Commissioner's expert  appraisal--we concluded  that the\n\ntaxpayer failed  to bear  its burden of  proving a  valuation\n\nhigher than that of the Commissioner.\n\n          Here, too, we have  a taxpayer appraisal that fails\n\nto consider  potential legal obstacles toward  fulfilling the\n\nproperty's  full  monetary  potential.     Moreover,  as  the\n\nCommissioner  points out, the  McMurrays' experts also failed\n\nto  consider many other aspects of a peat mining operation in\n\narriving at their conclusion.7   Thus, given the shortcomings\n\n                    \n\n7.  For   example,  Brenninkmeyer  reached  his  $35  million\nconclusion by multiplying the  Bog's estimated volume by $145\nper ton, which was the average  retail price of coal in 1989.\nHe  failed, however, to assess the market for peat during the\nrelevant  time period,  or  the costs  and  feasibility of  a\ncomplete peat  extraction.   Kasevich's income  statement was\nbased on the 1990 peat harvesting figures of his own company,\nbut did  not include any  potential overhead costs.   Worley,\nrelying  on  Kasevich's  income  statement,  assumed, without\nfactual  support,  that  all  equipment  could  be  purchased\noutright,  and   thus  did  not  consider   financing  costs.\nSignificantly, both  Kasevich and Worley alluded  to the fact\nthat successes in  the peat harvesting business were few, and\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof  the  McMurrays'   experts'  reports,   the  tax   court's\n\nconclusion that  the McMurrays  failed to carry  their burden\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n          In the  alternative, the  McMurrays  argue that  if\n\nstate and  local regulatory  constraints deprive them  of the\n\nBog's  economic potential,  then  they are  entitled to  just\n\ncompensation under  the United States Constitution  in return\n\nfor a regulatory taking.

Even assuming\n                     \n\nthat Lucas would  turn the regulations  involved here into  a\n          \n\n\"taking,\"  the  short  answer  is  that  the  McMurrays  have\n\noverlooked the fact  that any such \"taking\"  was performed by\n\nstate  and local authorities, and as such gives them no right\n\nto seek  compensation--via  tax deductions--from  the  United\n\nStates, an  entirely different  sovereign.  Moreover,  to the\n\nextent that the McMurrays argue for including the value of an\n\ninverse condemnation suit against  the State of New Hampshire\n\nin the  Bog valuation, the tax court correctly concluded that\n\nthe success of such a suit is not as assured as the McMurrays\n\ndeclare, and  that  the record  is  \"devoid of  any  evidence\n\n                    \n\nthat  most of  the peat harvesting  operations of  which they\nwere aware had failed.   While Kasevich's Down East  Peat Co.\nwas an  apparent exception,  we cannot  quarrel with  the Tax\nCourt's conclusion  that  reliance on  Down East's  financial\nperformance to  estimate the McMurray's potential  success is\n\"like saying  that anybody  opens a hamburger  chain and  you\nestimate the profit potential by what McDonald's does.\"  \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndirected  toward valuing any such  claim.\"  Thus  we find the\n\ntax court did not err in rejecting this argument.\n\n          Finally, the  McMurrays argue that  the tax court's\n\nreliance on  Fremeau's use of comparative sales  to value the\n\nBog was inappropriate due to  the Bog's uniqueness.  Instead,\n\nthe McMurrays,  relying on Estate of  Palmer v.

We disagree.  The\n\nMcMurrays, unlike  the taxpayers in Palmer,  have provided no\n                                          \n\nevidence  of replacement cost and thus we find no clear error\n\nin the tax court's  reliance on Fremeau's evaluation method.8\n\n Accordingly, we  affirm the  tax court's decision  to uphold\n\nthe Commissioner's deficiency determinations.9\n\n                    \n\n8.  While it  is true  that Fremeau's  comparative properties\nwere not identical to the Bog in some respects, the Tax Court\nfound that  they were  the most comparable  for the  relevant\ntime and  place.   See  Symington,  87 T.C.  at  900 (in  the\n                                 \nabsence  of  identical  properties, comparable  sales  method\ntakes  into  account  differences,  and  through  appropriate\nadjustment, arrives at a value for the subject property).  As\nthe  record demonstrates  that the  compared properties  were\nalso non-developable  wetlands, and that state  Fish and Game\nand Forest Protection Society personnel held  at least two of\nthe properties in  the same high esteem  as the Bog,  we find\nthe   Tax  Court's   endorsement  of   Fremeau's  methodology\neminently supportable.

In our view, the \"bare\n\nfact\"  that the  McMurrays attached  Donovon's  appraisals to\n\nsupport  their 1982  and 1985  returns  is evidence  of their\n                                          \n\nreliance  on the appraisals.   In other words,  why else were\n\nthey  submitted with the returns,  but for the  fact that the\n\n                    \n\n11.  It  is unclear from the record whether the Tax Court was\nquestioning  the McMurrays'  actual reliance  on Donovon,  or\nwhether any such reliance was reasonable.  With that in mind,\nwe will delve into both areas.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nMcMurrays  were relying on them?  Furthermore, we fail to see\n\nhow  any of  the other  factors cited  by  the tax  court are\n\nprobative of the McMurrays' reliance.  For instance, the fact\n\nthat the McMurrays pursued a different legal tack at trial in\n\n1991  has  little  bearing  on the  reasonableness  of  their\n\nactions in 1982 and 1985.  Also, while the McMurrays may have\n\nsome knowledge  as to  \"real estate development,\"  the record\n\nevidence of such knowledge falls far short  of requiring them\n\nto  second-guess a  licensed appraiser--especially  one whose\n\n1979 appraisal apparently passed muster with the Commissioner\n\nas  support for the deductions taken for the 1979 conveyance.\n\nFinally, we note that the minimal probative value assigned by\n\nthe  tax  court to  the  McMurrays' expert  opinion  does not\n\nmandate a finding of bad faith or unreasonable reliance.  See\n                                                             \n\nSammons,  838  F.2d   at  337  (although  taxpayer's   expert\n       \n\nappraisal  was  not  entitled  to  any  probative  weight  in\n\ndetermining   the  fair   market   value  of   a   charitable\n\ncontribution, imposing a negligence penalty was inappropriate\n\nbecause taxpayers  had no  reason to question  their expert's\n\nability) (citing  Biagiotti v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.M.</span>\n                                           \n\n<span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595  (1986)).  We  conclude, therefore, that  the record\n\nlacks  sufficient evidence  of bad faith  to support  the tax\n\ncourt's negligence ruling, and instead compels a finding that\n\nthe McMurrays met their burden of proof on this issue.\n\n     2.  Valuation Overstatement\n                                \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Section 6659 of the Code imposes an addition to tax\n\nif  the amount  of  any underpayment  of  $1,000 or  more  is\n\nattributable  to  a  valuation  overstatement  of  charitable\n\ndeduction  property.12    For  purposes of  this  section,  a\n\nvaluation overstatement exists where the claimed value is 150\n\npercent  or more  of  the amount  determined  to be  correct.\n\nI.R.C.   6659(c)(1).   Here, the McMurrays claimed a donation\n\nvalue  of $803,933 in 1982, and a  value of $637,500 in 1985.\n\nThe tax  court, however, ruled  that the values  were $12,500\n\nand  $41,700,   respectively.    These   figures  place   the\n\nMcMurrays'  overstatement beyond the 150 percent threshold of\n\nsection 6659.  \n\n          The  McMurrays seek  relief under  section 6659(e),\n\nwhich allows for a waiver of \"all or any part of the addition\n\nto tax provided by this section on a showing by  the taxpayer\n\nthat there  was  a  reasonable basis  for  the  valuation  or\n\nadjusted  basis claimed on the return and that such claim was\n\nmade  in good faith.\"   While we have  already concluded that\n\nthe  McMurrays acted  in reasonable  reliance on  the Donovon\n\nappraisal, the  inquiry does  not end there,  because section\n\n6659(f)(2)  prohibits a  penalty waiver  unless \"the  claimed\n\nvalue of the property was based on a qualified appraisal made\n\nby  a qualified  appraiser,\" and,  \"in addition  to obtaining\n                                \n\n                    \n\n12.  The assessed  penalty is 30 percent  of the underpayment\nattributable to the valuation overstatement.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nsuch   an  appraisal,   the  taxpayer   made  a   good  faith\n\ninvestigation  of the value of the contributed property.\"  On\n\nappeal, the McMurrays do  not address section 6659(f)(2), nor\n\ndoes  our  review  of  the  record  indicate  any  additional\n\ninvestigation  by  the  McMurrays   into  the  value  of  the\n\nproperty.  Thus, we affirm the imposition of  penalties under\n\nsection 6659.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          The  tax  court's  decision  with  respect  to  the\n\nCommissioner's deficiency determination and additions  to tax\n\nunder I.R.C.   6659  is affirmed.
