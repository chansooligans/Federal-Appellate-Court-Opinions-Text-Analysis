The plaintiff  in this case\n                              \n\n(the  \"Developer\")  is a  real  estate  trust  that hired  a\n\nContractor to build condominiums.  The Developer says that a\n\nSubcontractor  -- a  maker  of exterior  walling systems  --\n\ndefaulted on  its contract  to supply the  condominiums with\n\n\"curtain  walls.\"   And,  it has  sued that  Subcontractor's\n\nsurety, The Hartford Fire Insurance Company, for damages.  \n\n          The district court, trying  both the facts and the\n\nlaw,  found that the Developer suffered no harm -- at least,\n\nnone  that legally entitles it to  an award of damages.  The\n\nDeveloper  now appeals, basically asking us to find that the\n\ncourt's factfinding  was \"clearly erroneous.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n52(a).    The  district  court's  findings,   however,  have\n\nadequate  record  support;  and,  we  therefore  affirm  its\n\njudgment.\n\n          We have  read the record in  a light appropriately\n\nfavorable  to  the winning  party,  defendant  Surety.   See\n                                                            \n\nCapt'n Mark v. Sea Fever Corp., 692 F.2d  163, 166 (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1982).  So read,  the record reveals the  following relevant\n\nbackground facts:\n\n          1)   In  a contract  dated  December 2,  1987, the\n               Subcontractor promised  the Contractor (which\n               in turn was  controlled by the  Developer) to\n               provide  curtain  walls  for the  condominium\n               building for a total price of $339,655. \n\n          2)   As of June  or July, 1988,  the Subcontractor\n               had substantially completed the job.  Several\n               months  later,  on  November  4,   1988,  the\n               Contractor's    architect    provided     the\n               Subcontractor  with a  \"punch  list\" of  five\n               items to be corrected (such as \"rust  stains\"\n               on certain walls,  \"misalignment\" of  certain\n               panels, \"incomplete trim\" around some sliding\n               doors,  etc.)    About  ten days  later,  the\n               architect  sent an  expanded  list  of  eight\n               items.\n\n          3)   On November 18, 1988, the Subcontractor wrote\n               back that  the work  on the punch  list \"will\n               cost  approximately  $3,000   to  $4,000   to\n               remedy.\"  But, it would not perform that work\n               until  the  architect   released  its   final\n               payment  (which  it  estimated  to  be  about\n               $31,000).  It pointed  out that the architect\n               retained  an  additional  $34,000  (otherwise\n               belonging to the  Subcontractor) as  security\n               for  performance; and,  it  agreed  that  the\n               architect need  not release this  money until\n               all  the  work  was   complete.    In   early\n               December,   the   Developer   wrote  to   the\n               architect that the punch list work \"ha[d] not\n               been started,\"  that it would  require 24  of\n               the  units  \"to  be  plumbed  out\"  (removing\n               existing  dry wall), and that this would cost\n               $2,200 per condominium unit.   A month later,\n               the Developer  wrote to  the Surety that  the\n               Subcontractor was in \"default.\"\n\n          4)   Ten  months  later,  in  November  1989,  the\n               Developer's  counsel  wrote  to   the  Surety\n               stating that the  Subcontractor's failure  to\n               cure the punch  list defects  meant that  the\n               Developer could not \n\n                    conclude closings of\n                    fifty-four      (54)\n                    units   which   were\n                    under        written\n                    purchase   and  sale\n                    agreements      with\n                    third parties.   \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n               He   added  that   these  \"damages   are  not\n               speculative,\" and that he would  like to work\n               with the Surety \"in acquiring  a settlement.\"\n               Counsel  wrote  further  letters,  threatened\n               legal  action,  and  then, in  preparing  for\n               litigation   in   September  1990,   had  the\n               architect  draw  up   a  final  repair   cost\n               estimate totalling roughly $345,000.  \n\nAfter the Surety refused to pay,  the Developer brought this\n\ndiversity  action, arguing,  among  other  things, that  the\n\nSurety broke its surety  contract requiring it \"promptly\" to\n\n\"remedy\" any \"default,\" and seeking damages in the amount of\n\nthe repair and completion costs ($345,000).\n\n          After a  trial, the district  court concluded that\n\nthe Developer had failed  to prove its case.  The court said\n\nthat  although  it  accepted Developer's  sole  witness (the\n\narchitect) as competent to testify on the matter of damages,\n\nit need not \"credit\"  his opinion.  Specifically,  the court\n\nrejected the architect's $345,000  correction-cost estimate,\n\nwhich in the court's view was \"an extraordinary amount,\" and\n\nwhich  (by  what  seemed  to  the  court  \"an  extraordinary\n\ncoincidence\") amounted to  the entire curtain  wall contract\n\nprice.   The court found  \"more immediate\" problems  for the\n\nDeveloper  in the  fact that,  even if  one assumed  that it\n\nwould cost  $345,000 to  dismantle portions of  the building\n\nand then make  the punch  list repairs, that  cost would  so\n\nvastly exceed \"any resulting benefit\" that it would \"involve\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nunreasonable  economic  waste.\"  (internal  quotation  marks\n\nomitted).   In such circumstances, the  court concluded that\n\nthe  proper  measure  of  damages was  (1)  the  Developer's\n\nreasonably incurred actual costs, or (2) the loss of  market\n                                    \n\nvalue (e.g., the difference between  the market value of the\n           \n\nstructure-as-promised and the market value of the structure-\n\nas-constructed).   See generally Concannon  v. Galanti,  202\n                                                      \n\nN.E.2d  236,  238  (Mass.  1964);  Restatement  (Second)  of\n                                                            \n\nContracts     348(2) &amp;  cmt. c  (1979);  John D.  Calamari &amp;\n         \n\nJoseph  M.  Perillo, Contracts    14-29,  at 633-36  (3d ed.\n                              \n\n1987).  Because  the record lacked any concrete  evidence as\n\nto either, the plaintiff was not entitled to any recovery.\n\n          On appeal, the Developer argues at length that the\n\ndistrict court erred in  its factfinding.  But, on  the all-\n\nimportant  issue  of  loss  suffered  as  a  result  of  the\n\nSubcontractor's  (alleged)  default,  the Developer's  brief\n\ncontains virtually  no  citations to  the record.   We  have\n\nreviewed  the  record  independently,   but  have  found  no\n\nsignificant evidence  tending to  show \"lost unit  sales\" or\n\nsales  \"at  reduced  prices,\"   or  any  other  evidence  of\n\ndiminished market value.   Indeed, the one  person who would\n\nseem to have been qualified to testify about the market loss\n\ncaused by the alleged  defects in the walling system  -- the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nDeveloper's trustee,  Alfred Pace,  Sr. -- did  not testify.\n\nWe, like the  district court, can find no  concrete evidence\n\nof  loss, other  than  the evidence  about  the $345,000  in\n\ncorrection costs,  which figure the district  court found to\n\nbe  both (1)  unbelievable  and (2)  an  improper basis  for\n\nrecovery.  We must respect the district court's  decision to\n\nreject the architect's  opinion.  See Dedham Water Co., Inc.\n                                                            \n\nv. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992).    We also  agree with  the  district court,  for the\n\nreasons it stated, that the $345,000 is not a legally proper\n\nmeasure of damages.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts  \n                                                          \n\n348(2)  &amp;  cmt.  c.    Of  course,  we  recognize  that  the\n\nSubcontractor itself  conceded  that it  would cost  roughly\n\n$3,000 to $4,000 as  of November 1988 to complete  the punch\n\nlist items, and that, with minor exceptions, they were never\n\ncompleted.  But, as  far as we  can tell, the Developer  did\n\nnot  seek recovery for  those costs, and  the Developer does\n\nnot  argue for those  specific costs on  appeal.    Thus, we\n\nneed not consider  in this context  whose fault it  actually\n\nwas that the punch list corrections were never made.\n\n          The   district   court    also   held   that   the\n\nSubcontractor's refusal  to make  the punch list  repairs in\n\nNovember  1988  did not  amount  to  a \"default,\"  for  that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nfailure represented  a reasonable refusal not  to proceed in\n\nthe absence of a further payment, to which the Subcontractor\n\nwas entitled.  The record more than adequately supports this\n\nfinding.   And,  in its  light, we  agree with  the district\n\ncourt that there was  not sufficient evidence of \"rascality\"\n\nby the Surety to  support a chapter 93A  claim.

See Capt'n Mark v. Sea Fever Corp., 692 F.2d 163, 166 (1st Cir. 1982).  So read, the record reveals the following relevant background facts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) In a contract dated December 2, 1987, the Subcontractor promised the Contractor (which in turn was controlled by the Developer) to provide curtain walls for the condominium building for a total price of $339,655.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) As of June or July, 1988, the Subcontractor had substantially completed the job.  Several months later, on November 4, 1988, the Contractor's architect provided the Subcontractor with a \"punch list\" of five items to be corrected (such as \"rust stains\" on certain walls, \"misalignment\" of certain panels, \"incomplete trim\" around some sliding doors, etc.)  About ten days later, the architect sent an expanded list of eight items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) On November 18, 1988, the Subcontractor wrote back that the work on the punch list \"will cost approximately $3,000 to $4,000 to remedy.\"  But, it would not perform that work until the architect released its final payment (which it estimated to be about $31,000).  It pointed out that the architect retained an additional $34,000 (otherwise belonging to the Subcontractor) as security for performance;  and, it agreed that the architect need not release this money until all the work was complete.  In early December, the Developer wrote to the architect that the punch list work \"ha[d] not been started,\" that it would require 24 of the units \"to be plumbed out\" (removing existing dry wall), and that this would cost $2,200 per condominium unit.  A month later, the Developer wrote to the Surety that the Subcontractor was in \"default.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4) Ten months later, in November 1989, the Developer's counsel wrote to the Surety stating that the Subcontractor's failure to cure the punch list defects meant that the Developer could not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>conclude closings of fifty-four (54) units which were under written purchase and sale agreements with third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>He added that these \"damages are not speculative,\" and that he would like to work with the Surety \"in acquiring a settlement.\"  Counsel wrote further letters, threatened legal action, and then, in preparing for litigation in September 1990, had the architect draw up a final repair cost estimate totalling roughly $345,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Surety refused to pay, the Developer brought this diversity action, arguing, among other things, that the Surety broke its surety contract requiring it \"promptly\" to \"remedy\" any \"default,\" and seeking damages in the amount of the repair and completion costs ($345,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a trial, the district court concluded that the Developer had failed to prove its case.

In such circumstances, the court concluded that the proper measure of damages was (1) the Developer's reasonably incurred actual costs, or (2) the loss of market value (e.g., the difference between the market value of the structure-as-promised and the market value of the structure-as-constructed).

Because the record lacked any concrete evidence as to either, the plaintiff was not entitled to any recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Developer argues at length that the district court erred in its factfinding.  But, on the all- important issue of loss suffered as a result of the Subcontractor's (alleged) default, the Developer's brief contains virtually no citations to the record.  We have reviewed the record independently, but have found no significant evidence tending to show \"lost unit sales\" or sales \"at reduced prices,\" or any other evidence of diminished market value.  Indeed, the one person who would seem to have been qualified to testify about the market loss caused by the alleged defects in the walling system-the Developer's trustee, Alfred Pace, Sr.-did not testify.  We, like the district court, can find no concrete evidence of loss, other than the evidence about the $345,000 in correction costs, which figure the district court found to be both (1) unbelievable and (2) an improper basis for recovery.  We must respect the district court's decision to reject the architect's opinion.   See Dedham Water Co., Inc. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).  We also agree with the district court, for the reasons it stated, that the $345,000 is not a legally proper measure of damages.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 348(2) &amp; cmt. c. Of course, we recognize that the Subcontractor itself conceded that it would cost roughly $3,000 to $4,000 as of November 1988 to complete the punch list items, and that, with minor exceptions, they were never completed.  But, as far as we can tell, the Developer did not seek recovery for those costs, and the Developer does not argue for those specific costs on appeal.  Thus, we need not consider in this context whose fault it actually was that the punch list corrections were never made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that the Subcontractor's refusal to make the punch list repairs in November 1988 did not amount to a \"default,\" for that failure represented a reasonable refusal not to proceed in the absence of a further payment, to which the Subcontractor was entitled.  The record more than adequately supports this finding.  And, in its light, we agree with the district court that there was not sufficient evidence of \"rascality\" by the Surety to support a chapter 93A claim.  Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (Mass. 1979).  The finding of no proven damages is also sufficient to warrant judgment for the Surety on the Developer's remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Developer says that a Subcontractor-a maker of exterior walling systems-defaulted on its contract to supply the condominiums with \"curtain walls.\"  And, it has sued that Subcontractor's surety, The Hartford Fire Insurance Company, for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, trying both the facts and the law, found that the Developer suffered no harm-at least, none that legally entitles it to an award of damages.  The Developer now appeals, basically asking us to find that the court's factfinding was \"clearly erroneous.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  The district court's findings, however, have adequate record support;  and, we therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have read the record in a light appropriately favorable to the winning party, defendant Surety.   See Capt'n Mark v. Sea Fever Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410369\"><a href=\"/opinion/410369/captn-mark-etc-v-sea-fever-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 166 (1st Cir. 1982).  So read, the record reveals the following relevant background facts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) In a contract dated December 2, 1987, the Subcontractor promised the Contractor (which in turn was controlled by the Developer) to provide curtain walls for the condominium building for a total price of $339,655.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) As of June or July, 1988, the Subcontractor had substantially completed the job.  Several months later, on November 4, 1988, the Contractor's architect provided the Subcontractor with a \"punch list\" of five items to be corrected (such as \"rust stains\" on certain walls, \"misalignment\" of certain panels, \"incomplete trim\" around some sliding doors, etc.)  About ten days later, the architect sent an expanded list of eight items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) On November 18, 1988, the Subcontractor wrote back that the work on the punch list \"will cost approximately $3,000 to $4,000 to remedy.\"  But, it would not perform that work until the architect released its final payment (which it estimated to be about $31,000).  It pointed out that the architect retained an additional $34,000 (otherwise belonging to the Subcontractor) as security for performance;  and, it agreed that the architect need not release this money until all the work was complete.  In early December, the Developer wrote to the architect that the punch list work \"ha[d] not been started,\" that it would require 24 of the units \"to be plumbed out\" (removing existing dry wall), and that this would cost $2,200 per condominium unit.  A month later, the Developer wrote to the Surety that the Subcontractor was in \"default.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4) Ten months later, in November 1989, the Developer's counsel wrote to the Surety stating that the Subcontractor's failure to cure the punch list defects meant that the Developer could not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>conclude closings of fifty-four (54) units which were under written purchase and sale agreements with third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>He added that these \"damages are not speculative,\" and that he would like to work with the Surety \"in acquiring a settlement.\"  Counsel wrote further letters, threatened legal action, and then, in preparing for litigation in September 1990, had the architect draw up a final repair cost estimate totalling roughly $345,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Surety refused to pay, the Developer brought this diversity action, arguing, among other things, that the Surety broke its surety contract requiring it \"promptly\" to \"remedy\" any \"default,\" and seeking damages in the amount of the repair and completion costs ($345,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a trial, the district court concluded that the Developer had failed to prove its case.  The court said that although it accepted Developer's sole witness (the architect) as competent to testify on the matter of damages, it need not \"credit\" his opinion.  Specifically, the court rejected the architect's $345,000 correction-cost estimate, which in the court's view was \"an extraordinary amount,\" and which (by what seemed to the court \"an extraordinary coincidence\") amounted to the entire curtain wall contract price.  The court found \"more immediate\" problems for the Developer in the fact that, even if one assumed that it would cost $345,000 to dismantle portions of the building and then make the punch list repairs, that cost would so vastly exceed \"any resulting benefit\" that it would \"involve unreasonable economic waste.\"  (internal quotation marks omitted).  In such circumstances, the court concluded that the proper measure of damages was (1) the Developer's reasonably incurred actual costs, or (2) the loss of market value (e.g., the difference between the market value of the structure-as-promised and the market value of the structure-as-constructed).

Galanti, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></span>, 238 (Mass. 1964);  Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 348(2) &amp; cmt. c (1979);  John D.
