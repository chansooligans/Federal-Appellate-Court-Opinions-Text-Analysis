William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                 Torruella, Boudin and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                        \n\n   Nazzaro Scarpa on brief pro se.\n                 \n   Albert W. Wallis, Corporation Counsel  and William J. Walsh,\n                                                              \nAssistant Corporation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.   Nazzaro  Scarpa sued  Nicholas Saggese,  a\n               \n\nBoston police officer,  alleging that Saggese used  excessive\n\nforce  in arresting and  detaining him on  March 1,  1988.  A\n\njury found for Saggese.  Scarpa appeals.  He also appeals the\n\nsubsequent denial of a motion to reconsider the denial of his\n\nmotion for a new trial.  We affirm.\n\n     1.   There  was no abuse  of discretion in  the district\n\ncourt's refusal to continue  the trial pending the filing  of\n\nan appearance by counsel for Scarpa.  Scarpa indicated trial-\n\nreadiness in April 1992, by  asking for assignment of a trial\n\ndate.  His request was granted and the case was placed on the\n\ncourt's running trial list as of September 1992.  On March 9,\n\n1993, the  case was  called for March  15.   Despite Scarpa's\n\nApril 1992 assertion that he  was ready for trial, it appears\n\nthat he  thereafter attempted  to obtain  counsel.  But,  the\n\nearliest indication of interest in the case by an attorney is\n\nmid-February  1993.     There  is  no  explanation   for  the\n\nincongruity of asserting trial-readiness while simultaneously\n\nattempting to obtain counsel, who most assuredly would seek a\n\ncontinuance.  Further, there is  no explanation for the delay\n\nuntil mid-February.\n\n     Moreover, the  interest expressed by  Scarpa's potential\n\ncounsel was  tentative  at  best.   Counsel  never  filed  an\n\nappearance in the  case.  Counsel apparently was unwilling to\n\nenter  an  appearance  prior  to  a  court order  granting  a\n\n                             -2-\n\ncontinuance.   The  court did  not  abuse its  discretion  in\n\ndeclining to continue this trial, initially pressed by Scarpa\n\neleven  months earlier,  in the absence  of an  appearance by\n\ncounsel and  in the face  of such a tentative  and contingent\n\nexpression of interest.\n\n     2.   Contrary to Scarpa's contention, the district court\n\ncannot  be faulted for  failing to  secure the  attendance of\n\ncertain witnesses who, despite a reasonable attempt, were not\n\nfound.  Scarpa  argues that  the witnesses  should have  been\n\nserved  with subpoenas \"months  before trial\" or  a \"subpoena\n\ncard\" should have been left at their addresses.  One does not\n\nissue an open-ended  subpoena for attendance  at trial.   The\n\nsubpoena  must  recite  the specific  trial  date,  for which\n\nattendance  is required.   \"Every subpoena shall  ... command\n\neach  person  to whom  it  is  directed  to attend  and  give\n\ntestimony ... at  a time and place therein  specified.\"  Fed.\n\nR. Civ.  P. 45(a)(1)(C).   The trial date  was not  set until\n\nMarch 9.   Moreover, a  subpoena cannot be left  at someone's\n\nhome;  it must be  served upon the  person.  Fed.  R. Civ. P.\n\n45(b)(1); see  also 9 Charles  A. Wright &amp; Arthur  R. Miller,\n                   \n\nFederal Practice and Procedure   2461 at 447 (1971).\n\n     Scarpa  moved for  a new  trial on  the ground  that the\n\nmarshals'  service had not made a  reasonable effort to serve\n\nhis  witnesses, submitting  a letter  from  Attorney Paul  F.\n\nMurphy, dated April 26, 1993.   The district court  correctly\n\n                             -3-\n\ndenied this motion as  untimely.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P.  59(b)\n                                     \n\n(motion shall be  served not later than ten  days after entry\n\nof  judgment).  The court subsequently denied Scarpa's motion\n\nto reconsider.\n\n     On his appeal from this denial, Scarpa contends that his\n\nmotion should be construed as a Rule 60(b)(2) motion based on\n\nnewly discovered evidence.  This is unavailing.   Scarpa knew\n\nat trial that the marshals had been unable to effect service.\n\nThe information provided  in Attorney Murphy's letter  is not\n\nnewly discovered  in a Rule  60(b)(2) sense, i.e., it  is not\n\n\"newly discovered evidence  which by due diligence  could not\n\nhave been discovered in  time to move  for a new trial  under\n\nRule 59(b).\"   And, in  any event, the  information contained\n\ntherein  is not  inconsistent  with, or  cast  doubt on,  the\n\nreasonableness  of the  attempted service.   Attorney  Murphy\n\nreiterates that Ms. Carrillo was away at the time of Scarpa's\n\ntrial  and, as  for Ms.  McDermatt, the marshals'  failure to\n\nserve her appears to  have resulted from Scarpa's  failure to\n\nprovide them  with a correct  spelling of both her  first and\n\nlast names and a correct address.\n\n     3.   Scarpa  argues that the court should have granted a\n\nmistrial when Officer LoPriore, Saggese's partner, apparently\n\nunwittingly,  violated  a  witness  sequestration  order   by\n\nremaining  in  the  courtroom   during  Saggese's  testimony.\n\nDetermination   of  a   sanction  for   a   violation  of   a\n\n                             -4-\n\nsequestration order  is within  the sound  discretion of  the\n\ntrial court.  United States  v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262,\n                                             \n\n1266  (1st Cir. 1992).   In this  case, the  court barred the\n\ntestimony of  a second witness  who also had  heard Saggese's\n\ntestimony,  allowed Scarpa  to ask  LoPriore  whether he  had\n\nmemorized Saggese's responses, and  stated that Scarpa  could\n\nargue this  inference to  the jury.   There was  no abuse  in\n\ndiscretion in refusing to grant a mistrial.\n\n     4.   The  record  does not  support  Scarpa's allegation\n\nthat  the  jury was  coerced  into  returning  a verdict  for\n\nSaggese by  the modified  Allen charge,  see Allen  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 164  U.S. 492  (1896), given by  the court  after the\n      \n\njury  indicated that  it could  not  reach a  decision.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v.  Nichols,  820 F.2d  508, 511-12  (1st Cir.\n                          \n\n1987)  (approving substantially the same charge in a criminal\n\ncase);  9  Charles  A.  Wright &amp;  Arthur  R.
