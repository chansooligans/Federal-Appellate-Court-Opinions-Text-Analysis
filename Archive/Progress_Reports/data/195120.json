On  June  3,  1991,  a  jury\n                            \n\nconvicted the  12 defendants  in this  case of  conspiracy to\n\npossess  cocaine  with  intent  to  distribute;  one  of  the\n\ndefendants,  David   Sepulveda,  was  also   convicted  on  a\n\ncontinuing criminal enterprise count.  21 U.S.C.    846, 848.\n\nOn  December  10,  1992, the  defendants  filed  a post-trial\n\nmotion  seeking  dismissal  or  a new  trial  based  on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.  The district court denied the motion in\n\na decision filed February 25, 1993.   The defendants appealed\n\nseparately  from the  judgments of  conviction  and from  the\n\ndenial  of  the   post-trial  motion,  and  the   cases  were\n\nconsolidated for oral argument.\n\n     In United States v. Sepulveda,  No. 92-1362, et al. (1st\n                                                       \n\nCir., Dec. 20, 1993), this court has affirmed the convictions\n\nof  10 of the 12 defendants, but vacated two of the sentences\n\nand  remanded those cases  for resentencing.1   That decision\n\nsets forth in  detail the factual background of  the case but\n\naddresses  only issues presented on the original appeals from\n\nthe  convictions.  In  this opinion, we  consider the appeals\n\nchallenging the  denial of the defendants' post-trial motion.\n\nWe  conclude  that  the district  court  properly  denied the\n\n                    \n\n     1In United States v. Sepulveda, Nos. 92-1368 and 92-1370\n                                   \n(1st Cir. 1993), filed simultaneously with this opinion, this\ncourt  has  affirmed  the convictions  of  the  remaining two\ndefendants   but  remanded   one  of   the   two  cases   for\nresentencing.\n\n                             -5-\n\nmotion and that neither  a new trial  nor a dismissal of  the\n\ncases was warranted.\n\n     Among the  more than 30 witnesses who  testified for the\n\ngovernment  at the  trial  was  Joseph  Baranski.    Baranski\n\ntestified  that he  had  dealt in  cocaine as  a  user and  a\n\nretailer and that  David Sepulveda had been one of Baranski's\n\nsources  of supply.   Baranski described journeys  with David\n\nSepulveda  to  secure  drugs in  Nashua,  New  Hampshire, and\n\nestimated that he had  bought from him 50 to 60  times in the\n\nperiod 1985-1986.    Baranski said  that  co-defendant  Edgar\n\nSepulveda sometimes participated in the trips.  Baranski also\n\nmade  brief   incriminating  references   to  several   other\n\ndefendants, such as Cullinane and Langlois.  The former, said\n\nBaranski,  supplied one of Baranski's other sources of drugs,\n\nand the latter was an enforcer for David Sepulveda.\n\n     At trial defense  counsel managed  to impair  Baranski's\n\ncredibility  rather effectively.   Baranski denied making any\n\ndeal  with  the  government that  might  explain  why he  was\n\ndelivering testimony that incriminated him as well as several\n\nof the defendants.  Instead, he said he was testifying out of\n\nfriendship with James Noe, who had previously been a business\n\npartner with Baranski both in  operating a compact disc store\n\nin  Manchester,  New Hampshire,  and in  cocaine trafficking.\n\nBaranski said that Noe, who was also a witness, had asked him\n\nto testify and that he had obliged.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     Asked  whether he had received any compensation from the\n\ngovernment,  Baranski said  that he  had been  bought a  diet\n\nsoda.   The  assistant United  States  attorney then  advised\n\ndefense  counsel   that  records  of   the  Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration showed  that Baranski  had been  paid $500  in\n\n1986 and  again in 1988  for assisting it in  drug arrests or\n\nprosecutions.    Baranski  was recalled  for  further  cross-\n\nexamination and  made to admit  the more recent  payment; the\n\nearlier  one  he said  he  did  not  recall.   His  testimony\n\nincluded other improbable failures of recollection.\n\n     Following  the  trial  and  the  resulting  convictions,\n\ndefense counsel uncovered  a sworn complaint  dated September\n\n15, 1992, that Baranski had  filed in his own lawsuit against\n\nthe  State of  New  Hampshire.   In  that document,  Baranski\n\ndescribed  a raid by New  Hampshire state police conducted on\n\nFebruary 10, 1988, on Baranski  and Noe's compact disc  store\n\nin  Manchester.   There the  police seized cocaine  and about\n\n$20,000 in  cash.  Baranski's  complaint said that he  had no\n\nknowledge of the drug dealing and  that all but $1,700 of the\n\nfunds were proceeds of legitimate business interests.\n\n     The complaint went  on to say  that the law  enforcement\n\nofficers had told Baranski that  the bulk of the seized money\n\nwould not be  returned to him unless he  was \"willing to work\n\nit   off.\"    Baranski,  according  to  the  complaint,  then\n\n\"reluctantly  agreed to  assist the  state  in its  anti-drug\n\n                             -7-\n\noperations.  Since  the date of the seizure  Mr. Baranski has\n\nassisted the state  of New Hampshire.\"   Baranski's complaint\n\nsaid that the state had  returned $6,000 of the money to  him\n\nbut declined to  return the rest.  The  complaint sought \"the\n\nbalance\"  of the  money  as  an  unconstitutional  taking  of\n\nproperty.2\n\n     In   their  motion  filed  on  December  10,  1992,  the\n\ndefendants  argued   that  the   information  set   forth  in\n\nBaranski's complaint was  newly discovered evidence of  great\n\nsignificance.    The  motion  claimed  that  the  information\n\nconstituted  Brady material of which the prosecution knew, or\n                  \n\nshould  have known, either  directly or through  its agents.3\n\nDefense counsel  charged the  government with misconduct  and\n\nargued that during  his testimony Baranski had  concealed his\n\nrelationship  with  law   enforcement  authorities  and   his\n\ncompensation arrangements concerning  the seized money.   The\n\nremedy, defendants urged,  was either dismissal of  the cases\n\nor a new trial.\n\n                    \n\n     2Based  on  this   information,  defense  counsel   then\nsearched the  state court  records pertaining  to the  search\nwarrant that had authorized the raid of February 10, 1988.  A\nstate  police  property  receipt  showed  that   the  amounts\nspecified in Baranski's complaint had indeed been seized.\n\n     3Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83  (1963), is the standard\n                       \nstatement   of  the  prosecutor's  obligation  to  turn  over\nexculpatory material.   In Giglio v. United States,  405 U.S.\n                                                  \n150  (1972), the  Supreme  Court  said  that  the  obligation\nincludes  evidence  that  would  impeach  the credibility  of\ngovernment witnesses.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     A flurry of  further filings followed.   The prosecutors\n\ndenied that they or the case agents assisting them had during\n\nthe  trial any knowledge  of an arrangement  between Baranski\n\nand  the  state   police  for  him  to   cooperate  with  law\n\nenforcement authorities.  The government also argued that the\n\nadditional impeaching  effect of  such information, if  true,\n\nwould not conceivably have altered the outcome  of the trial,\n\ngiven the limited role of Baranski's testimony and the parade\n\nof witnesses against the defendants.  Defense counsel filed a\n\nbroad-gauged  motion  to   produce  including  all  materials\n\nrelated  to any  agreements with  Baranski or  Noe as  to the\n\nreturn of the seized money.\n\n     On  February 25,  1993, the  district  court denied  the\n\nmotion for  dismissal  or a  new trial.   It  ruled that  the\n\nrecord provided an  adequate basis for resolving  the motion.\n\nThe court  pointed out  that Noe had  testified at  trial and\n\ndisclosed the search of his business premises in the February\n\n1988 raid; since the records of the raid were not sealed, the\n\ncourt said that  defense counsel, knowing of the  raid, could\n\nhave  secured  the  information   about  the  funds   seizure\n\nthemselves.   Accordingly, the court declined to describe the\n\nevidence as  \"newly discovered,\" implying that  due diligence\n\nby  defense counsel would  have uncovered the  information in\n\ntime for trial.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     The  court also said that Baranski's own trial testimony\n\nhad shown him to  be a witness of \"dubious\" credibility.  The\n\nadditional  information provided by  the Baranski state court\n\ncomplaint  was, at most, additional impeaching evidence.  The\n\ncourt  said that the additional evidence  if presented to the\n\njury would not likely have  altered the outcome of the trial,\n\nso  that  the  defendants  had  failed  to make  the  minimum\n\nnecessary showing  for a  new trial.    Indeed, the  district\n\ncourt indicated that there was no reasonable possibility that\n\nthe evidence would have had altered the outcome.\n\n     We agree with the district  court that even the complete\n\ndiscrediting and  elimination of  Baranski's testimony  would\n\nnot have changed the  outcome in this case, and that alone is\n\nbasis enough to affirm the court's denial of the motion.  The\n\ndefense may have a plausible argument that even if a diligent\n\npre-trial  search had uncovered  the state police  records of\n\nthe search  and seizure of  the funds, these facts  would not\n\nhave disclosed the supposed \"work it off\" arrangement alleged\n\nin  Baranski's complaint.  Nevertheless, as we explain below,\n\nnew trials based on newly discovered evidence, or on evidence\n\nwithheld by the prosecution, require specified showings as to\n\nthe likelihood  of a different  result.  The defense  has not\n\nmade those showings.\n\n     We  start by  putting to  one  side any  claim that  the\n\ngovernment engaged in deliberate misconduct.  The prosecutors\n\n                             -10-\n\nrepresented that neither they nor any of the case agents were\n\naware  of any  deal between  Baranski and  the New  Hampshire\n\nauthorities  that  Baranski  would  regain  seized  funds  by\n\ncooperating  with the  state or  anyone else.   The  district\n\ncourt accepted this  representation, and nothing said  in the\n\ndefense  briefs gives  us any  reason  to question  it or  to\n\napprove the fishing expedition proposed by the defense motion\n\nto produce.\n\n     What we have is evidence  that might have been useful to\n\ndefense counsel  in  seeking further  to discredit  Baranski.\n\nPrimarily, his state court complaint, if believed, suggests a\n\ncontinuing link with  state law enforcement  authorities that\n                           \n\nendured  during the trial of this case  and a desire to curry\n\nfavor with state authorities in  order to recover more of his\n\nfunds.  It is not apparent that helpful testimony by Baranski\n\nin  this federal  prosecution  would  have  been  treated  as\n\ncooperation by  the state  or facilitated  the recovery,  but\n\ndefense counsel could  have cross-examined on this  point and\n\nthe jury might have believed that Baranski would benefit from\n\nhis testimony.\n\n     Further,  information  derived  from   the  state  court\n\ncomplaint might have been used to bolster the impression that\n\nBaranski was  lying  at  trial  in his  vague  and  equivocal\n\nstatements about his prior links with law enforcement.  It is\n\nnot clear that the state  court complaint, or for that matter\n\n                             -11-\n\nthe  two  $500  payments  by  DEA  to  Baranski  for  earlier\n\ncooperation, are literally inconsistent with Baranski's trial\n\ntestimony.4    Still, as  with  the $500  payments  from DEA,\n\nBaranski's failure  to disclose the  alleged arrangement with\n\nthe  state police  would  probably  have  been  portrayed  as\n\ndiscrediting,  and  the   jury  might  have  drawn   such  an\n\ninference.\n\n     Thus, we have no difficulty in regarding the evidence as\n\npotentially useful to the defense, although less damning than\n\nthe defense brief  suggests.  The difficulty for  the instant\n\nappeals starts with  the reasonably high barriers  erected by\n\ncase law when a  defendant seeks a  new trial based on  newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.  If it  is new evidence unconnected with\n\nthe  government, then--other  requisites aside--the  evidence\n\nmust create  an actual  probability that  an acquittal  would\n\nhave  resulted if the  evidence had  been available.

Slade,  980 F.2d  27, 29  (1st Cir.  1992); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980).\n                \n\n     Where  the government possessed the evidence but did not\n\ndisclose it,  a statement of  the rule is more  difficult, in\n\npart  because the  leading Supreme  Court  case produced  two\n\n                    \n\n     4Baranski's  reference  to  a  diet  soda  was  made  in\nresponse to rather  loosely worded questions.   The two  $500\npayments  were  apparently   for  his  assistance   on  prior\noccasions,  and the defense brief points to no clear evidence\nthat Baranski had any deal with any law enforcement agency as\nto this  case, or  received any  compensation apart  from the\n       \ndiet soda for his testimony in this case.\n                                   \n\n                             -12-\n\nplurality  opinions.  United  States v. Bagley,  473 U.S. 667\n                                              \n\n(1987).   The usual  locution, taken from  Justice Blackmun's\n\nopinion in Bagley, is that the nondisclosure justifies a  new\n                 \n\ntrial  if it is \"material,\" it is \"material\" only if there is\n\n\"a reasonable  probability\"  that  the  evidence  would  have\n\nchanged  the result,  and a  \"reasonable  probability\" is  \"a\n\nprobability  sufficient   to  undermine  confidence   in  the\n\noutcome.\"  Id. at 682.\n              \n\n     This  somewhat  delphic \"undermine  confidence\"  formula\n\nsuggests  that reversal might be warranted in some cases even\n\nif there is less than an even  chance that the evidence would\n\nproduce an  acquittal.  After  all, if the evidence  is close\n\nand   the  penalty  significant,   one  might  think     that\n\nundisclosed  evidence creating  (for  example)  a 33  percent\n\nchance of a different result would undermine one's confidence\n\nin  the result.   And  while  Bagley appears  to give  little\n                                    \n\nweight to other  factors--such as the degree of  fault on the\n\nprosecutor's part and the specificity of the defense request-\n\n-it  is  not entirely  clear  that  these  variables must  be\n\nignored.  Cf.  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 680-82  (Blackmun, J.) and\n                     \n\n685 (White, J.).\n\n     In   all  events,  we   need  not  wrestle   with  these\n\nuncertainties in  this case.   We will  assume arguendo  (but\n                                                       \n\nwith   little  basis  in   this  record)  that   the  federal\n\nprosecutors or their agents knew  or should have known of the\n\n                             -13-\n\ninformation in  question.   Nevertheless, we  agree with  the\n\ndistrict court that the likelihood of a different outcome, if\n\nthe additional  information  had been  available  to  defense\n\ncounsel,  is extremely slight and does not remotely undermine\n\nour confidence in the verdicts.  Thus, whichever  standard is\n\napplied--whether for newly discovered evidence or negligently\n\nwithheld evidence--the result in this case is the same.5\n\n     The only important testimony offered by Baranski against\n\nany  of  the   defendants  concerned   the  Sepulvedas'   own\n\ntrafficking  and Baranski's trips with them while both, or in\n\nsome  cases  David  Sepulveda  alone,  obtained  cocaine  for\n\nBaranski  in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Quite similar testimony,\n\nhowever, was provided by Noe himself.  It is not apparent why\n\nBaranski's self-described cooperation  with state authorities\n\n(even if true)  discredits Noe's testimony.6   In any  event,\n\nother witnesses testified to various cocaine collection trips\n\n                    \n\n     5Neither  our decisions nor those of other circuits have\nbeen  sympathetic to  new trial  claims based  solely on  the\ndiscovery of  additional information useful for  impeaching a\ngovernment witness,  e.g., United States  v. Formanczyk,  949\n                                                       \nF.2d  526, 531 (1st  Cir. 1991); United  States v. Burroughs,\n                                                            \n830 F.2d 1574,  1578-79 (11th Cir. 1987), although  we do not\nread  the  cases to  say  that  such  evidence can  never  be\nsufficient.\n\n     6A  New  Hampshire  state  police  receipt,   apparently\nlocated  by  the  federal prosecutors  after  this  trial and\nprovided  to defense counsel,  indicates that $10,000  of the\nseized funds were  returned to Noe on February  12, 1990, two\ndays after the  raid.  There  is no basis for  inferring that\nthis return of funds was contingent on, or in any way related\nto, Noe's testimony  in this case which occurred  more than a\nyear later.\n\n                             -14-\n\nby the Sepulvedas, and there is no serious basis for doubting\n\nthat they occurred.  \n\n     The  defendants assert that Baranski and Noe furnished a\n\ncritical link in the evidence by establishing the Sepulvedas'\n\nactivities  in 1985 and  1986--the principal period  of these\n\nwitnesses'   trips   with  the   Sepulvedas--so   that  these\n\nactivities could be connected to the drug  trafficking of the\n\nSepulvedas in 1987 and thereafter.  This, say the defendants,\n\nhelped  the  government   establish  the  single   conspiracy\n\ncovering the entire period as charged in the indictment.  But\n\nin  fact  another  drug  dealer  witness,  Michael   Lacerte,\n\ndescribed his drug dealings with David Sepulveda in 1985  and\n\n1986,  and   his  testimony  was  corroborated  in  different\n\nrespects  by various law  enforcement agents.   The \"critical\n\nlink\" argument is inventive but not persuasive.\n\n     Defendants  argue  for a  more favorable--that  is, less\n\ndemanding--test of  likelihood  that the  outcome would  have\n\nbeen different  if the  new information  had been  available,\n\nciting our decision in United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.  1990).   There, the  court described  the ordinary\n\nrequisites   for  a  new  trial  based  on  newly  discovered\n\nevidence, including  the requirement that the  defendant show\n\nthat the new evidence would probably have altered the result.\n\nHowever, Wright went  on to say that where  a defense witness\n               \n\nis shown by post-trial evidence to have testified falsely, it\n\n                             -15-\n\nmay  be enough to  justify a new  trial for the  defendant to\n\nshow that the result \"might\"  have been different without the\n\nfalse testimony.  Id. at 1020.7\n                     \n\n     The defendants, as already noted, overstate the force of\n\nthe  new information: it  does not demonstrate  that Baranski\n\ngave false testimony at trial.  It is not even clear that the\n\nnew information seriously compromises Baranski's credibility,\n\nalthough it opens a line of attack that defendants might have\n\nexploited.  We will  assume for present purposes  that Wright\n                                                             \n\nestablishes a  special rule  with a  more favorable  standard\n\nwhere  post-trial evidence  shows  that an  important witness\n\nlied at trial.  Still, such a rule has no application in this\n\ncase because  the state  court complaint  does not  show that\n\nBaranski lied at trial.\n\n     The appeals  from the  denial of  the post-trial  motion\n\nhave  been vigorously pursued  by able defense  counsel.  The\n\njoint  defendants'  brief,  and our  own  reading  of  all of\n\nBaranski's  trial  testimony,   confirm  the  trial   judge's\n\nassessment  that  Baranski's credibility  was  dubious.   But\n\nalmost  all the  material  for  making  that  assessment  was\n\navailable to  the jury, and the new  information derived from\n\nBaranski's state court  complaint added very little.   In the\n\n                    \n\n     7Wright derived this  \"arguably applicable\" standard for\n            \nperjured  testimony  from  a 1928  Seventh  Circuit decision,\nLarrison v. United States, 24 F.2d  82 (7th Cir. 1928).   See\n                                                             \n625 F.2d at 1020.\n\n                             -16-\n\nend, there is  less to the defense argument  than first meets\n\nthe eye, and certainly not enough to \"undermine confidence in\n\nthe outcome.\"  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n                     \n\n     Affirmed.

Secs. 846, 848.  On December 10, 1992, the defendants filed a post-trial motion seeking dismissal or a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.  The district court denied the motion in a decision filed February 25, 1993.  The defendants appealed separately from the judgments of conviction and from the denial of the post-trial motion, and the cases were consolidated for oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161 (1st Cir., 1993), this court has affirmed the convictions of 10 of the 12 defendants, but vacated two of the sentences and remanded those cases for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That decision sets forth in detail the factual background of the case but addresses only issues presented on the original appeals from the convictions.  In this opinion, we consider the appeals challenging the denial of the defendants' post-trial motion.  We conclude that the district court properly denied the motion and that neither a new trial nor a dismissal of the cases was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the more than 30 witnesses who testified for the government at the trial was Joseph Baranski.  Baranski testified that he had dealt in cocaine as a user and a retailer and that David Sepulveda had been one of Baranski's sources of supply.  Baranski described journeys with David Sepulveda to secure drugs in Nashua, New Hampshire, and estimated that he had bought from him 50 to 60 times in the period 1985-1986.  Baranski said that co-defendant Edgar Sepulveda sometimes participated in the trips.  Baranski also made brief incriminating references to several other defendants, such as Cullinane and Langlois.  The former, said Baranski, supplied one of Baranski's other sources of drugs, and the latter was an enforcer for David Sepulveda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial defense counsel managed to impair Baranski's credibility rather effectively.  Baranski denied making any deal with the government that might explain why he was delivering testimony that incriminated him as well as several of the defendants.  Instead, he said he was testifying out of friendship with James Noe, who had previously been a business partner with Baranski both in operating a compact disc store in Manchester, New Hampshire, and in cocaine trafficking.  Baranski said that Noe, who was also a witness, had asked him to testify and that he had obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked whether he had received any compensation from the government, Baranski said that he had been bought a diet soda.  The assistant United States attorney then advised defense counsel that records of the Drug Enforcement Administration showed that Baranski had been paid $500 in 1986 and again in 1988 for assisting it in drug arrests or prosecutions.  Baranski was recalled for further cross-examination and made to admit the more recent payment;  the earlier one he said he did not recall.  His testimony included other improbable failures of recollection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trial and the resulting convictions, defense counsel uncovered a sworn complaint dated September 15, 1992, that Baranski had filed in his own lawsuit against the State of New Hampshire.  In that document, Baranski described a raid by New Hampshire state police conducted on February 10, 1988, on Baranski and Noe's compact disc store in Manchester.  There the police seized cocaine and about $20,000 in cash.  Baranski's complaint said that he had no knowledge of the drug dealing and that all but $1,700 of the funds were proceeds of legitimate business interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint went on to say that the law enforcement officers had told Baranski that the bulk of the seized money would not be returned to him unless he was \"willing to work it off.\"   Baranski, according to the complaint, then \"reluctantly agreed to assist the state in its anti-drug operations.  Since the date of the seizure Mr. Baranski has assisted the state of New Hampshire.\"   Baranski's complaint said that the state had returned $6,000 of the money to him but declined to return the rest.  The complaint sought \"the balance\" of the money as an unconstitutional taking of property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their motion filed on December 10, 1992, the defendants argued that the information set forth in Baranski's complaint was newly discovered evidence of great significance. The motion claimed that the information constituted Brady material of which the prosecution knew, or should have known, either directly or through its agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Defense counsel charged the government with misconduct and argued that during his testimony Baranski had concealed his relationship with law enforcement authorities and his compensation arrangements concerning the seized money.  The remedy, defendants urged, was either dismissal of the cases or a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of further filings followed.  The prosecutors denied that they or the case agents assisting them had during the trial any knowledge of an arrangement between Baranski and the state police for him to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.  The government also argued that the additional impeaching effect of such information, if true, would not conceivably have altered the outcome of the trial, given the limited role of Baranski's testimony and the parade of witnesses against the defendants.  Defense counsel filed a broad-gauged motion to produce including all materials related to any agreements with Baranski or Noe as to the return of the seized money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1993, the district court denied the motion for dismissal or a new trial.  It ruled that the record provided an adequate basis for resolving the motion.  The court pointed out that Noe had testified at trial and disclosed the search of his business premises in the February 1988 raid;  since the records of the raid were not sealed, the court said that defense counsel, knowing of the raid, could have secured the information about the funds seizure themselves.  Accordingly, the court declined to describe the evidence as \"newly discovered,\" implying that due diligence by defense counsel would have uncovered the information in time for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also said that Baranski's own trial testimony had shown him to be a witness of \"dubious\" credibility.  The additional information provided by the Baranski state court complaint was, at most, additional impeaching evidence.  The court said that the additional evidence if presented to the jury would not likely have altered the outcome of the trial, so that the defendants had failed to make the minimum necessary showing for a new trial.  Indeed, the district court indicated that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence would have had altered the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that even the complete discrediting and elimination of Baranski's testimony would not have changed the outcome in this case, and that alone is basis enough to affirm the court's denial of the motion.  The defense may have a plausible argument that even if a diligent pre-trial search had uncovered the state police records of the search and seizure of the funds, these facts would not have disclosed the supposed \"work it off\" arrangement alleged in Baranski's complaint.  Nevertheless, as we explain below, new trials based on newly discovered evidence, or on evidence withheld by the prosecution, require specified showings as to the likelihood of a different result.  The defense has not made those showings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by putting to one side any claim that the government engaged in deliberate misconduct.  The prosecutors represented that neither they nor any of the case agents were aware of any deal between Baranski and the New Hampshire authorities that Baranski would regain seized funds by cooperating with the state or anyone else.  The district court accepted this representation, and nothing said in the defense briefs gives us any reason to question it or to approve the fishing expedition proposed by the defense motion to produce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have is evidence that might have been useful to defense counsel in seeking further to discredit Baranski.  Primarily, his state court complaint, if believed, suggests a continuing link with state law enforcement authorities that endured during the trial of this case and a desire to curry favor with state authorities in order to recover more of his funds.  It is not apparent that helpful testimony by Baranski in this federal prosecution would have been treated as cooperation by the state or facilitated the recovery, but defense counsel could have cross-examined on this point and the jury might have believed that Baranski would benefit from his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, information derived from the state court complaint might have been used to bolster the impression that Baranski was lying at trial in his vague and equivocal statements about his prior links with law enforcement.  It is not clear that the state court complaint, or for that matter the two $500 payments by DEA to Baranski for earlier cooperation, are literally inconsistent with Baranski's trial testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Still, as with the $500 payments from DEA, Baranski's failure to disclose the alleged arrangement with the state police would probably have been portrayed as discrediting, and the jury might have drawn such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have no difficulty in regarding the evidence as potentially useful to the defense, although less damning than the defense brief suggests.  The difficulty for the instant appeals starts with the reasonably high barriers erected by case law when a defendant seeks a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.  If it is new evidence unconnected with the government, then--other requisites aside--the evidence must create an actual probability that an acquittal would have resulted if the evidence had been available.  United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).  The usual locution, taken from Justice Blackmun's opinion in Bagley, is that the nondisclosure justifies a new trial if it is \"material,\" it is \"material\" only if there is \"a reasonable probability\" that the evidence would have changed the result, and a \"reasonable probability\" is \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"   Id. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This somewhat delphic \"undermine confidence\" formula suggests that reversal might be warranted in some cases even if there is less than an even chance that the evidence would produce an acquittal.

And while Bagley appears to give little weight to other factors--such as the degree of fault on the prosecutor's part and the specificity of the defense request--it is not entirely clear that these variables must be ignored.

We will assume arguendo (but with little basis in this record) that the federal prosecutors or their agents knew or should have known of the information in question.  Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that the likelihood of a different outcome, if the additional information had been available to defense counsel, is extremely slight and does not remotely undermine our confidence in the verdicts.  Thus, whichever standard is applied--whether for newly discovered evidence or negligently withheld evidence--the result in this case is the same.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only important testimony offered by Baranski against any of the defendants concerned the Sepulvedas' own trafficking and Baranski's trips with them while both, or in some cases David Sepulveda alone, obtained cocaine for Baranski in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Quite similar testimony, however, was provided by Noe himself.  It is not apparent why Baranski's self-described cooperation with state authorities (even if true) discredits Noe's testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In any event, other witnesses testified to various cocaine collection trips by the Sepulvedas, and there is no serious basis for doubting that they occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert that Baranski and Noe furnished a critical link in the evidence by establishing the Sepulvedas' activities in 1985 and 1986--the principal period of these witnesses' trips with the Sepulvedas--so that these activities could be connected to the drug trafficking of the Sepulvedas in 1987 and thereafter.  This, say the defendants, helped the government establish the single conspiracy covering the entire period as charged in the indictment.  But in fact another drug dealer witness, Michael Lacerte, described his drug dealings with David Sepulveda in 1985 and 1986, and his testimony was corroborated in different respects by various law enforcement agents.  The \"critical link\" argument is inventive but not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue for a more favorable--that is, less demanding--test of likelihood that the outcome would have been different if the new information had been available, citing our decision in United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir.1980).  There, the court described the ordinary requisites for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, including the requirement that the defendant show that the new evidence would probably have altered the result.  However, Wright went on to say that where a defense witness is shown by post-trial evidence to have testified falsely, it may be enough to justify a new trial for the defendant to show that the result \"might\" have been different without the false testimony.  Id. at 1020.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, as already noted, overstate the force of the new information:  it does not demonstrate that Baranski gave false testimony at trial.  It is not even clear that the new information seriously compromises Baranski's credibility, although it opens a line of attack that defendants might have exploited.  We will assume for present purposes that Wright establishes a special rule with a more favorable standard where post-trial evidence shows that an important witness lied at trial.  Still, such a rule has no application in this case because the state court complaint does not show that Baranski lied at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals from the denial of the post-trial motion have been vigorously pursued by able defense counsel.  The joint defendants' brief, and our own reading of all of Baranski's trial testimony, confirm the trial judge's assessment that Baranski's credibility was dubious.  But almost all the material for making that assessment was available to the jury, and the new information derived from Baranski's state court complaint added very little.  In the end, there is less to the defense argument than first meets the eye, and certainly not enough to \"undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Secs. 846, 848.  On December 10, 1992, the defendants filed a post-trial motion seeking dismissal or a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.  The district court denied the motion in a decision filed February 25, 1993.  The defendants appealed separately from the judgments of conviction and from the denial of the post-trial motion, and the cases were consolidated for oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span> (1st Cir., 1993), this court has affirmed the convictions of 10 of the 12 defendants, but vacated two of the sentences and remanded those cases for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That decision sets forth in detail the factual background of the case but addresses only issues presented on the original appeals from the convictions.  In this opinion, we consider the appeals challenging the denial of the defendants' post-trial motion.  We conclude that the district court properly denied the motion and that neither a new trial nor a dismissal of the cases was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the more than 30 witnesses who testified for the government at the trial was Joseph Baranski.  Baranski testified that he had dealt in cocaine as a user and a retailer and that David Sepulveda had been one of Baranski's sources of supply.  Baranski described journeys with David Sepulveda to secure drugs in Nashua, New Hampshire, and estimated that he had bought from him 50 to 60 times in the period 1985-1986.  Baranski said that co-defendant Edgar Sepulveda sometimes participated in the trips.  Baranski also made brief incriminating references to several other defendants, such as Cullinane and Langlois.  The former, said Baranski, supplied one of Baranski's other sources of drugs, and the latter was an enforcer for David Sepulveda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial defense counsel managed to impair Baranski's credibility rather effectively.  Baranski denied making any deal with the government that might explain why he was delivering testimony that incriminated him as well as several of the defendants.  Instead, he said he was testifying out of friendship with James Noe, who had previously been a business partner with Baranski both in operating a compact disc store in Manchester, New Hampshire, and in cocaine trafficking.  Baranski said that Noe, who was also a witness, had asked him to testify and that he had obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked whether he had received any compensation from the government, Baranski said that he had been bought a diet soda.  The assistant United States attorney then advised defense counsel that records of the Drug Enforcement Administration showed that Baranski had been paid $500 in 1986 and again in 1988 for assisting it in drug arrests or prosecutions.  Baranski was recalled for further cross-examination and made to admit the more recent payment;  the earlier one he said he did not recall.  His testimony included other improbable failures of recollection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trial and the resulting convictions, defense counsel uncovered a sworn complaint dated September 15, 1992, that Baranski had filed in his own lawsuit against the State of New Hampshire.  In that document, Baranski described a raid by New Hampshire state police conducted on February 10, 1988, on Baranski and Noe's compact disc store in Manchester.  There the police seized cocaine and about $20,000 in cash.  Baranski's complaint said that he had no knowledge of the drug dealing and that all but $1,700 of the funds were proceeds of legitimate business interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint went on to say that the law enforcement officers had told Baranski that the bulk of the seized money would not be returned to him unless he was \"willing to work it off.\"   Baranski, according to the complaint, then \"reluctantly agreed to assist the state in its anti-drug operations.  Since the date of the seizure Mr. Baranski has assisted the state of New Hampshire.\"   Baranski's complaint said that the state had returned $6,000 of the money to him but declined to return the rest.  The complaint sought \"the balance\" of the money as an unconstitutional taking of property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their motion filed on December 10, 1992, the defendants argued that the information set forth in Baranski's complaint was newly discovered evidence of great significance. The motion claimed that the information constituted Brady material of which the prosecution knew, or should have known, either directly or through its agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Defense counsel charged the government with misconduct and argued that during his testimony Baranski had concealed his relationship with law enforcement authorities and his compensation arrangements concerning the seized money.  The remedy, defendants urged, was either dismissal of the cases or a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of further filings followed.  The prosecutors denied that they or the case agents assisting them had during the trial any knowledge of an arrangement between Baranski and the state police for him to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.  The government also argued that the additional impeaching effect of such information, if true, would not conceivably have altered the outcome of the trial, given the limited role of Baranski's testimony and the parade of witnesses against the defendants.  Defense counsel filed a broad-gauged motion to produce including all materials related to any agreements with Baranski or Noe as to the return of the seized money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1993, the district court denied the motion for dismissal or a new trial.  It ruled that the record provided an adequate basis for resolving the motion.  The court pointed out that Noe had testified at trial and disclosed the search of his business premises in the February 1988 raid;  since the records of the raid were not sealed, the court said that defense counsel, knowing of the raid, could have secured the information about the funds seizure themselves.  Accordingly, the court declined to describe the evidence as \"newly discovered,\" implying that due diligence by defense counsel would have uncovered the information in time for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also said that Baranski's own trial testimony had shown him to be a witness of \"dubious\" credibility.  The additional information provided by the Baranski state court complaint was, at most, additional impeaching evidence.  The court said that the additional evidence if presented to the jury would not likely have altered the outcome of the trial, so that the defendants had failed to make the minimum necessary showing for a new trial.  Indeed, the district court indicated that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence would have had altered the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that even the complete discrediting and elimination of Baranski's testimony would not have changed the outcome in this case, and that alone is basis enough to affirm the court's denial of the motion.  The defense may have a plausible argument that even if a diligent pre-trial search had uncovered the state police records of the search and seizure of the funds, these facts would not have disclosed the supposed \"work it off\" arrangement alleged in Baranski's complaint.  Nevertheless, as we explain below, new trials based on newly discovered evidence, or on evidence withheld by the prosecution, require specified showings as to the likelihood of a different result.  The defense has not made those showings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by putting to one side any claim that the government engaged in deliberate misconduct.  The prosecutors represented that neither they nor any of the case agents were aware of any deal between Baranski and the New Hampshire authorities that Baranski would regain seized funds by cooperating with the state or anyone else.  The district court accepted this representation, and nothing said in the defense briefs gives us any reason to question it or to approve the fishing expedition proposed by the defense motion to produce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have is evidence that might have been useful to defense counsel in seeking further to discredit Baranski.  Primarily, his state court complaint, if believed, suggests a continuing link with state law enforcement authorities that endured during the trial of this case and a desire to curry favor with state authorities in order to recover more of his funds.  It is not apparent that helpful testimony by Baranski in this federal prosecution would have been treated as cooperation by the state or facilitated the recovery, but defense counsel could have cross-examined on this point and the jury might have believed that Baranski would benefit from his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, information derived from the state court complaint might have been used to bolster the impression that Baranski was lying at trial in his vague and equivocal statements about his prior links with law enforcement.  It is not clear that the state court complaint, or for that matter the two $500 payments by DEA to Baranski for earlier cooperation, are literally inconsistent with Baranski's trial testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Still, as with the $500 payments from DEA, Baranski's failure to disclose the alleged arrangement with the state police would probably have been portrayed as discrediting, and the jury might have drawn such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have no difficulty in regarding the evidence as potentially useful to the defense, although less damning than the defense brief suggests.  The difficulty for the instant appeals starts with the reasonably high barriers erected by case law when a defendant seeks a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.  If it is new evidence unconnected with the government, then--other requisites aside--the evidence must create an actual probability that an acquittal would have resulted if the evidence had been available.

We will assume arguendo (but with little basis in this record) that the federal prosecutors or their agents knew or should have known of the information in question.  Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that the likelihood of a different outcome, if the additional information had been available to defense counsel, is extremely slight and does not remotely undermine our confidence in the verdicts.  Thus, whichever standard is applied--whether for newly discovered evidence or negligently withheld evidence--the result in this case is the same.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only important testimony offered by Baranski against any of the defendants concerned the Sepulvedas' own trafficking and Baranski's trips with them while both, or in some cases David Sepulveda alone, obtained cocaine for Baranski in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Quite similar testimony, however, was provided by Noe himself.  It is not apparent why Baranski's self-described cooperation with state authorities (even if true) discredits Noe's testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In any event, other witnesses testified to various cocaine collection trips by the Sepulvedas, and there is no serious basis for doubting that they occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert that Baranski and Noe furnished a critical link in the evidence by establishing the Sepulvedas' activities in 1985 and 1986--the principal period of these witnesses' trips with the Sepulvedas--so that these activities could be connected to the drug trafficking of the Sepulvedas in 1987 and thereafter.  This, say the defendants, helped the government establish the single conspiracy covering the entire period as charged in the indictment.  But in fact another drug dealer witness, Michael Lacerte, described his drug dealings with David Sepulveda in 1985 and 1986, and his testimony was corroborated in different respects by various law enforcement agents.  The \"critical link\" argument is inventive but not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue for a more favorable--that is, less demanding--test of likelihood that the outcome would have been different if the new information had been available, citing our decision in United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380303\"><a href=\"/opinion/380303/united-states-v-henry-james-wright-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1980).  There, the court described the ordinary requisites for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, including the requirement that the defendant show that the new evidence would probably have altered the result.  However, Wright went on to say that where a defense witness is shown by post-trial evidence to have testified falsely, it may be enough to justify a new trial for the defendant to show that the result \"might\" have been different without the false testimony.  Id. at 1020.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, as already noted, overstate the force of the new information:  it does not demonstrate that Baranski gave false testimony at trial.  It is not even clear that the new information seriously compromises Baranski's credibility, although it opens a line of attack that defendants might have exploited.  We will assume for present purposes that Wright establishes a special rule with a more favorable standard where post-trial evidence shows that an important witness lied at trial.  Still, such a rule has no application in this case because the state court complaint does not show that Baranski lied at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals from the denial of the post-trial motion have been vigorously pursued by able defense counsel.  The joint defendants' brief, and our own reading of all of Baranski's trial testimony, confirm the trial judge's assessment that Baranski's credibility was dubious.  But almost all the material for making that assessment was available to the jury, and the new information derived from Baranski's state court complaint added very little.  In the end, there is less to the defense argument than first meets the eye, and certainly not enough to \"undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
