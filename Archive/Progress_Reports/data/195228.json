Although  we find that  the BIA\n\nerred, we conclude that the error was harmless and affirm.\n\n                       I.  Background\n\n          White, a  citizen of  the Dominican  Republic, has\n\nlived as  a permanent resident  in this country  since 1970.\n\nIn 1982 she was arrested and charged with five separate drug\n\nand  three separate  firearm  offenses.1    She  was  tried,\n\nconvicted, and sentenced in the Massachusetts Superior Court\n\non four  of the charged  drug offenses.  The  remaining drug\n\ncharge and the three  firearm charges were placed  \"on file\"\n\n                    \n\n1  White was charged with committing three crimes on October\n29, 1982 (possession  of cocaine with intent  to distribute,\npossession of heroin, and unlawful possession of a handgun),\nand  five  crimes  on  December  16,  1982  (two  counts  of\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute,  possession\nof  heroin  with intent  to  distribute, and  two  counts of\nunlawful possession of a handgun).\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nby  that court.2   No penalties were  imposed on  any of the\n\n\"filed\" charges.\n\n          Citing   one   of   the   1983  drug   convictions\n\n(possession of cocaine  with the intent to  distribute), the\n\nImmigration and  Naturalization Service (INS)  ordered White\n\nto show cause why she should  not be deported.  Following an\n\nadministrative hearing,  White  was found  to be  deportable\n\nunder   241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"\n\nor \"the Act\")  (recodified at 8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(2)(B)(i)).\n\nThe   immigration   judge   denied   her   application   for\n\ndiscretionary  waiver  of  deportation  under  INA    212(c)\n\n(recodified at 8 U.S.C.   1182(c)).3\n\n          White appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\").   The BIA found  that while  the immigration  judge\n\nerred  in  intimating  (if  not  ruling)  that discretionary\n\n                    \n\n2  White pleaded guilty to the remaining drug offense before\nit was \"filed.\"   A jury returned a guilty verdict on one of\nthe firearm  charges, but  the court  placed that  charge on\nfile  and did  not enter  judgment.   The other  two firearm\ncharges were also \"filed,\" without entry of a guilty plea or\ndetermination  of  guilt.    See    our  discussion  of  the\nMassachusetts \"filing\" procedure, infra.\n                                       \n\n3   Congress amended INA    212(c) in 1990  to eliminate the\navailability of discretionary relief for any alien convicted\nof an aggravated felony who has served five years or more in\nprison.     The  amendment  applies   to  applications   for\ndiscretionary relief filed after November 20,  1991.  See De\n                                                            \nOsorio v. INS, 10 F.3d 1034 (4th Cir.  1993).  White applied\n             \nfor a waiver of deportation in 1986.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nrelief under    212(c) was unavailable to White  because she\n\nhad   been  found  guilty  of  serious  drug  offenses,  any\n\nprejudice resulting  from that  error could  be remedied  by\n\napplying   the    correct   legal   standard    on   appeal.\n\nAcknowledging White's  eligibility for  discretionary relief\n                                  \n\ndespite  her serious drug  offenses, the BIA  reassessed all\n\nequitable   factors   relevant   to  her   application   and\n\nindependently determined  that discretionary relief  was not\n\nwarranted.\n\n          The  BIA   observed  that  \"while   [the  equities\n\nfavoring  White] may be  unusual or outstanding,  [they] are\n\nnot  sufficient  to  counterbalance  her ser[i]ous  criminal\n\nmisconduct.\"   BIA  Decision at  5.   That serious  criminal\n\nmisconduct was described as follows:\n\n               [She]    was   convicted    of\n                                       \n               multiple counts  of possession\n               of  cocaine  or   heroin  with\n               intent   to  distribute,   and\n                                             \n               possession  of  firearms,  and\n                                       \n               one  count  of  possession  of\n               heroin.  She  committed crimes\n                                             \n               involving drug trafficking and\n                                             \n               firearms   on   two   separate\n                       \n               occasions              . . . .\n               [P]ossession  and  trafficking\n               in  drugs  is a  very  serious\n               adverse factor  in determining\n               whether  discretionary  relief\n               is  warranted  under   section\n               212(c).      We    find   this\n                                             \n               particularly     true    where\n                                             \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n               firearms  are involved,  given\n                                     \n               the potential for violence and\n               homicide they represent, as is\n               not   uncommon    where   drug\n               trafficking exists, and  which\n               together  tear  at   the  very\n                       \n               fabric of our society.  \n\nBIA Decision at 5 (emphasis added).\n\n                      II.  The Issues\n\n          White  challenges the  denial  of a  discretionary\n\nwaiver of  deportability, arguing that  the BIA  erred as  a\n\nmatter of law when it weighed her \"filed\" charges as if they\n\nhad been final \"convictions.\"  White also complains that the\n\nBIA gave too much weight  to certain adverse factors and too\n\nlittle weight to favorable factors in  denying relief.  Only\n\nthe first point requires discussion.4\n\n                    \n\n4    In  concluding  that  White's  positive  equities  were\ninsufficient to offset negative  factors, the BIA considered\nthe evidence  before it.   To the extent  White's complaints\nare  directed to  the relative  weight  given favorable  and\nunfavorable factors,  they are  without merit.   Gouveia  v.\n                                                            \nINS, 980 F.2d 814, 819 (1st Cir. 1992).\n   \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n                      III.  Discussion\n\n          Because  the decision to grant or deny relief from\n\ndeportation under    212(c)  is  a matter  committed to  the\n\nBIA's discretion,  we consider  only whether  the BIA  acted\n\narbitrarily  or  capriciously,  or  abused  its  discretion.\n\nHazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 438 (1st Cir. 1991); McLean v.\n                                                            \n\nINS, 901  F.2d 204, 205 (1st Cir.  1990).  The decision must\n   \n\nbe  upheld   \"unless  it   was  made   without  a   rational\n\nexplanation,   inexplicably   departed    from   established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\"  McLean, 901\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 205  (quoting Williams  v. INS, 773  F.2d 8, 9  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1985)).\n\n          In this  case we  need consider  only whether  the\n\nBIA's  decision \"rested on  an impermissible basis\"     that\n\nis,  whether  White's  \"filed\"  charges, particularly  those\n\nrelated   to  firearms,   were   improperly  considered   as\n\nconvictions, and, if so, whether that error was prejudicial.\n           \n\n          Section 241(a)(11) of the  INA declares deportable\n\nany alien who \"at any time has been convicted of a violation\n\nof .  . . any law or regulation of a State . . . relating to\n\na controlled substance.\"   8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(11).  But  an\n\nalien so convicted, like petitioner, may nevertheless  apply\n\nfor a waiver  of deportation under   212(c) of the Act if he\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nor she  has been a  lawful permanent resident of  the United\n\nStates  for at least seven  years.  8  U.S.C.   1182(c); see\n                                                            \n\nJoseph, 909 F.2d  at 606 n.1; Gando-Coello v.

INS, 655 F.2d 172 (9th Cir. 1981).\n               \n\n          It  is  apparent,  and the  INS  seems  willing to\n\nconcede,6 that  White's \"filed\" criminal  charges, including\n\nthe  three charges related  to unlawful  firearm possession,\n\nsimply  do  not  qualify  as  \"convictions\"  for immigration\n\npurposes.  Under Massachusetts law the \"filing\"  of a charge\n\nat any stage completely  suspends the adjudicative  process,\n\nincluding the defendant's  right to appeal, until  such time\n\nas the court  reactivates or makes some  further disposition\n\nof the  case.

Having done so, the\n\nBIA erred.\n\n                   B.  Prejudicial Error\n                                        \n\n          We turn now to  a more troublesome question.   Was\n\nWhite  prejudiced by the  error?  Improper  consideration of\n\nfavorable  or unfavorable factors  by the BIA  may sometimes\n\nconstitute  abuse of  discretion,  and  remand is  generally\n\nrequired if the  mistake could have affected  the balance of\n\nequities upon  which the decision  rests.

That  these drug convictions should weigh so\n\nheavily  against petitioner's  favorable  equities, the  BIA\n\nconcluded,  was  \"particularly   true  where  firearms   are\n\ninvolved.\"  Id. at 5  (emphasis added).  The record contains\n              \n\nample reliable evidence of White's simultaneous  involvement\n\nwith  drugs and  firearms.   The BIA's  conclusion  that the\n\nseverity  of petitioner's  drug convictions was  enhanced by\n\nher association  with firearms is a finding justified by the\n\nrecord and well within the boundaries of its discretion.  To\n\nbe sure, the  filed charges were erroneously referred  to as\n\n\"convictions,\"  but the  BIA did  not  rely on  the fact  of\n\nfirearm \"convictions\" per se in denying relief; it relied on\n\nWhite's conduct involving drugs and guns.  \n               \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n                      IV.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, has lived as a permanent resident in this country since 1970.  In 1982 she was arrested and charged with five separate drug and three separate firearm offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the Massachusetts Superior Court on four of the charged drug offenses.  The remaining drug charge and the three firearm charges were placed \"on file\" by that court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  No penalties were imposed on any of the \"filed\" charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing one of the 1983 drug convictions (possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ordered White to show cause why she should not be deported.  Following an administrative hearing, White was found to be deportable under Sec. 241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\" or \"the Act\") (recodified at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)).  The immigration judge denied her application for discretionary waiver of deportation under INA Sec. 212(c) (recodified at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").  The BIA found that while the immigration judge erred in intimating (if not ruling) that discretionary relief under Sec. 212(c) was unavailable to White because she had been found guilty of serious drug offenses, any prejudice resulting from that error could be remedied by applying the correct legal standard on appeal.  Acknowledging White's eligibility for discretionary relief despite her serious drug offenses, the BIA reassessed all equitable factors relevant to her application and independently determined that discretionary relief was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA observed that \"while [the equities favoring White] may be unusual or outstanding, [they] are not sufficient to counterbalance her ser[i]ous criminal misconduct.\"   BIA Decision at 5.

[P]ossession and trafficking in drugs is a very serious adverse factor in determining whether discretionary relief is warranted under section 212(c).  We find this particularly true where firearms are involved, given the potential for violence and homicide they represent, as is not uncommon where drug trafficking exists, and which together tear at the very fabric of our society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIA Decision at 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White challenges the denial of a discretionary waiver of deportability, arguing that the BIA erred as a matter of law when it weighed her \"filed\" charges as if they had been final \"convictions.\"   White also complains that the BIA gave too much weight to certain adverse factors and too little weight to favorable factors in denying relief.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the decision to grant or deny relief from deportation under Sec. 212(c) is a matter committed to the BIA's discretion, we consider only whether the BIA acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion.

But an alien so convicted, like petitioner, may nevertheless apply for a waiver of deportation under Sec. 212(c) of the Act if he or she has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for at least seven years.  8 U.S.C.

Once statutory eligibility is established, a waiver may be granted or denied at the discretion of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General has delegated exercise of her discretion to the BIA.

This finality requirement is satisfied if direct appellate review of the conviction has either been exhausted or waived.  Id.;  Martinez-Montoya v.

Under Massachusetts law the \"filing\" of a charge at any stage completely suspends the adjudicative process, including the defendant's right to appeal, until such time as the court reactivates or makes some further disposition of the case.  See Commonwealth v. Delgado, 367 Mass. 432, 438, 326 N.E.2d 716, 722 (Mass.1975).  In White's case, no punishment or penalty or restraint on liberty has been imposed on any of the filed charges, nor has she exhausted or waived her right to direct appellate review.  Accordingly, the BIA should not have considered the filed charges as \"convictions\" in deciding whether to grant White discretionary relief from deportation.

Was White prejudiced by the error?   Improper consideration of favorable or unfavorable factors by the BIA may sometimes constitute abuse of discretion, and remand is generally required if the mistake could have affected the balance of equities upon which the decision rests.

However, we also recognize that the BIA's decision need not be disturbed on appeal if the error is \"marginal.\"   See, e.g., Akrap, 966 F.2d at 272 n. 9 (declining to reverse denial of discretionary relief where BIA mistakenly assumed petitioner had six drug convictions when in fact he had five);  Spencer Livestock Comm'n v. Dep't of Agriculture, 841 F.2d 1451, 1458 (9th Cir.1988) (affirming administrative judgment even though two consent orders were improperly considered as evidence of trade violations, where other evidence of violations existed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White is undeniably deportable, and the BIA's mischaracterization of her filed charges did not preclude consideration for discretionary relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  She concedes that in reviewing an application for discretionary relief the BIA may consider any evidence of bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident.  See Matter of Edwards, Int.Dec. 3134 at 8 (BIA 1990) (listing adverse factors relevant to discretionary determinations).  Here, the BIA certainly could have considered her filed charges as some evidence weighing against discretionary relief.  See, e.g., Bustos-Torres v. INS, 898 F.2d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.1990) (evidence admissible if probative and fundamentally fair).  After all, White pleaded guilty to the filed drug charge and was found guilty by a jury on one of the filed firearm charges.  Given that evidence and the number, seriousness, and recency of White's unquestionably final drug convictions, as well as the other adverse factors found, it is difficult to perceive how the BIA's mistake could have affected the balance of equities on which the denial rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA found White's convictions for drug possession and drug trafficking to be \"a very serious adverse factor\" which could be offset only by a demonstration of \"unusual or outstanding equities.\"   BIA Decision at 4.  That these drug convictions should weigh so heavily against petitioner's favorable equities, the BIA concluded, was \"particularly true where firearms are involved.\"   Id. at 5 (emphasis added).  The record contains ample reliable evidence of White's simultaneous involvement with drugs and firearms.  The BIA's conclusion that the severity of petitioner's drug convictions was enhanced by her association with firearms is a finding justified by the record and well within the boundaries of its discretion.  To be sure, the filed charges were erroneously referred to as \"convictions,\" but the BIA did not rely on the fact of firearm \"convictions\" per se in denying relief;  it relied on White's conduct involving drugs and guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, has lived as a permanent resident in this country since 1970.  In 1982 she was arrested and charged with five separate drug and three separate firearm offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the Massachusetts Superior Court on four of the charged drug offenses.  The remaining drug charge and the three firearm charges were placed \"on file\" by that court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  No penalties were imposed on any of the \"filed\" charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing one of the 1983 drug convictions (possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ordered White to show cause why she should not be deported.  Following an administrative hearing, White was found to be deportable under Sec. 241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\" or \"the Act\") (recodified at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)).  The immigration judge denied her application for discretionary waiver of deportation under INA Sec. 212(c) (recodified at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").  The BIA found that while the immigration judge erred in intimating (if not ruling) that discretionary relief under Sec. 212(c) was unavailable to White because she had been found guilty of serious drug offenses, any prejudice resulting from that error could be remedied by applying the correct legal standard on appeal.  Acknowledging White's eligibility for discretionary relief despite her serious drug offenses, the BIA reassessed all equitable factors relevant to her application and independently determined that discretionary relief was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA observed that \"while [the equities favoring White] may be unusual or outstanding, [they] are not sufficient to counterbalance her ser[i]ous criminal misconduct.\"   BIA Decision at 5.  That serious criminal misconduct was described as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[She] was convicted of multiple counts of possession of cocaine or heroin with intent to distribute, and possession of firearms, and one count of possession of heroin.  She committed crimes involving drug trafficking and firearms on two separate occasions....  [P]ossession and trafficking in drugs is a very serious adverse factor in determining whether discretionary relief is warranted under section 212(c).  We find this particularly true where firearms are involved, given the potential for violence and homicide they represent, as is not uncommon where drug trafficking exists, and which together tear at the very fabric of our society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIA Decision at 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White challenges the denial of a discretionary waiver of deportability, arguing that the BIA erred as a matter of law when it weighed her \"filed\" charges as if they had been final \"convictions.\"   White also complains that the BIA gave too much weight to certain adverse factors and too little weight to favorable factors in denying relief.  Only the first point requires discussion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the decision to grant or deny relief from deportation under Sec. 212(c) is a matter committed to the BIA's discretion, we consider only whether the BIA acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion.

Under Massachusetts law the \"filing\" of a charge at any stage completely suspends the adjudicative process, including the defendant's right to appeal, until such time as the court reactivates or makes some further disposition of the case.  See Commonwealth v.

In White's case, no punishment or penalty or restraint on liberty has been imposed on any of the filed charges, nor has she exhausted or waived her right to direct appellate review.

However, we also recognize that the BIA's decision need not be disturbed on appeal if the error is \"marginal.\"   See, e.g., Akrap, 966 F.2d at 272 n. 9 (declining to reverse denial of discretionary relief where BIA mistakenly assumed petitioner had six drug convictions when in fact he had five);  Spencer Livestock Comm'n v. Dep't of Agriculture, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503088\"><a href=\"/opinion/503088/spencer-livestock-commission-company-mike-donaldson-v-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1451</span></a></span>, 1458 (9th Cir.1988) (affirming administrative judgment even though two consent orders were improperly considered as evidence of trade violations, where other evidence of violations existed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White is undeniably deportable, and the BIA's mischaracterization of her filed charges did not preclude consideration for discretionary relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  She concedes that in reviewing an application for discretionary relief the BIA may consider any evidence of bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident.  See Matter of Edwards, Int.Dec. 3134 at 8 (BIA 1990) (listing adverse factors relevant to discretionary determinations).  Here, the BIA certainly could have considered her filed charges as some evidence weighing against discretionary relief.  See, e.g., Bustos-Torres v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538520\"><a href=\"/opinion/538520/pedro-bustos-torres-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1055 (5th Cir.1990) (evidence admissible if probative and fundamentally fair).  After all, White pleaded guilty to the filed drug charge and was found guilty by a jury on one of the filed firearm charges.  Given that evidence and the number, seriousness, and recency of White's unquestionably final drug convictions, as well as the other adverse factors found, it is difficult to perceive how the BIA's mistake could have affected the balance of equities on which the denial rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA found White's convictions for drug possession and drug trafficking to be \"a very serious adverse factor\" which could be offset only by a demonstration of \"unusual or outstanding equities.\"   BIA Decision at 4.  That these drug convictions should weigh so heavily against petitioner's favorable equities, the BIA concluded, was \"particularly true where firearms are involved.\"   Id. at 5 (emphasis added).  The record contains ample reliable evidence of White's simultaneous involvement with drugs and firearms.  The BIA's conclusion that the severity of petitioner's drug convictions was enhanced by her association with firearms is a finding justified by the record and well within the boundaries of its discretion.  To be sure, the filed charges were erroneously referred to as \"convictions,\" but the BIA did not rely on the fact of firearm \"convictions\" per se in denying relief;  it relied on White's conduct involving drugs and guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between proof of guilt by final conviction and by some less reliable means is an important one to maintain.  But here, that distinction played no discernible role in the outcome.  The BIA's error was marginal and harmless under these facts.  See Liwanag v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521560\"><a href=\"/opinion/521560/jesus-paras-liwanag-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 687 n. 2 (5th Cir.1989) (no need to remand a case where there is little likelihood that the agency would have reached a different conclusion but for the error);  Akrap, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of discretionary relief is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> White was charged with committing three crimes on October 29, 1982 (possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of heroin, and unlawful possession of a handgun), and five crimes on December 16, 1982 (two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of heroin with intent to distribute, and two counts of unlawful possession of a handgun)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> White pleaded guilty to the remaining drug offense before it was \"filed.\"   A jury returned a guilty verdict on one of the firearm charges, but the court placed that charge on file and did not enter judgment.

The amendment applies to applications for discretionary relief filed after November 20, 1991.  See De Osorio v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658314\"><a href=\"/opinion/658314/nubia-marin-de-osorio-v-us-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1993).

To the extent White's complaints are directed to the relative weight given favorable and unfavorable factors, they are without merit.  Gouveia v.
