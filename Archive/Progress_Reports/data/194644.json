In 1985, in connection with his involvement\n               \n\nin the  Cerro  Maravilla incident,  defendant Rafael  Torres-\n\nMarrero was convicted of four  federal offenses: one count of\n\nconspiring  to  obstruct justice,  give  false testimony  and\n\nsuborn  perjury, in violation of  18 U.S.C.    371, and three\n\nsubstantive counts  of perjury, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n1623.  He was sentenced to five years in prison on each count\n\nto be served consecutively,  for a total of twenty years.  In\n\n1987, his  convictions and sentence were  affirmed on appeal.\n\nUnited States v.  Moreno Morales,  815 F.2d  725 (1st  Cir.),\n                                \n\ncert. denied, 484 U.S.  966 (1987).  In July  1992, defendant\n            \n\nfiled a motion under former Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) to correct\n\nwhat  he asserted was an  illegal sentence.   He there argued\n\nthat the imposition of  consecutive prison terms with respect\n\nto his three   1623 convictions violated both the statute and\n\nthe constitution.   The district court denied the motion, and\n\ndefendant now appeals.  We affirm.\n\n     The three perjury convictions under   1623 each involved\n\nfalse testimony that defendant  gave to a federal  grand jury\n\non March 6, 1980.   He first argues that, under the  terms of\n\nthe  statute, the  maximum  permissible prison  term for  all\n\nfalse declarations  given on  the  same day  before the  same\n\ngrand jury was five  years, regardless of the number  of such\n\ndeclarations.    We rejected  a  similar,  if not  identical,\n\ncontention in  the direct  appeal.   See Moreno Morales,  815\n                                                       \n\n                             -2-\n\nF.2d  at  752  (\"The  sentences  did not  exceed  the  limits\n\npermitted under  the  relevant federal  perjury statutes,  18\n\nU.S.C.    371,  1621-23.\")  Even if  not procedurally barred,\n\nthis argument is nonetheless  meritless.  The statute permits\n\nthe  imposition of  a five-year  prison term  for \"any  false\n\nmaterial  declaration.\"1   Defendant  relies  on    1623(c)'s\n\nreference  to \"two  or  more declarations\"  as evidence  that\n\nCongress intended to proscribe consecutive punishment in this\n\ncontext.2  Yet that  provision is irrelevant, as it  pertains\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 1623(a) provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Whoever  under  oath  ...  in  any  proceeding\n     before  or ancillary to any  court or grand jury of\n     the  United   States  knowingly  makes   any  false\n     material declaration  ... shall  be fined not  more\n     than  $10,000  or  imprisoned  not  more than  five\n     years, or both.\n\n2.  Section 1623(c) reads in pertinent part:\n\n          An indictment or information for  violation of\n     this  section alleging  that,  in  any  proceedings\n     before or ancillary  to any court or  grand jury of\n     the  United States,  the defendant  under oath  has\n     knowingly made two or more declarations, which  are\n     inconsistent  to the  degree  that one  of them  is\n     necessarily   false,   need   not   specify   which\n     declaration is false if--\n               (1) each declaration was material to the\n     point in question, and\n               (2)  each declaration was made within the\n          period of  the statute of  limitations for the\n          offense charged under this section.\n     In  any prosecution under this section, the falsity\n     of  a declaration  set forth  in the  indictment or\n     information  shall  be  established sufficient  for\n     conviction by proof that the defendant  while under\n     oath made irreconcilably contradictory declarations\n     material to the point in question in any proceeding\n     before or ancillary to any court or grand jury.\n\n                             -3-\n\nonly  to \"irreconcilably  contradictory  declarations.\"    As\n\ndiscussed  below, the declarations giving rise to the three  \n\n1623 convictions  here were not  of this  nature.  We  see no\n\nstatutory bar to the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\n     Defendant  also contends  that the  three    1623 counts\n\ncharged the  same offense and were  therefore multiplicitous,\n\nwith  the  consequence  that the  imposition  of  consecutive\n\nsentences  violated  the  double  jeopardy clause.    In  two\n\nunpublished  decisions, we  have  rejected similar  arguments\n\nadvanced  by two  of  defendant's codefendants.   See  Moreno\n                                                             \n\nMorales v. United States,  No. 92-1157, slip op. at  2-3 (1st\n                        \n\nCir. 1992) (per curiam);  Quiles-Hernandez v. United  States,\n                                                            \n\nNo.  90-1804, slip op. at  4-8 (1st Cir.  1991) (per curiam).\n\nAs  we   there  noted,  claims  of   multiplicity  constitute\n\n\"objections based  on defects in the  indictment\" which \"must\n\nbe raised  prior to trial.\"   Fed. R. Crim. P.  12(b)(2).  As\n\ndefendant  failed to raise  this contention at  that time, it\n\nmust  be   deemed  waived.    See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nRodriguez,  858  F.2d 809,  816-17  (1st  Cir. 1988);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 930-31 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                \n\n     Defendant's arguments prove meritless  in any event.  As\n\nwe  explained  in Quiles-Hernandez,  \"[t]he  fact  that [the]\n                                  \n\nstatements   [were]  uttered  in   the  same   proceeding  is\n\nirrelevant.\"    Slip  op.  at  6  (citing  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMolinares, 700 F.2d 647,  652-53 (11th Cir. 1983)).   So long\n         \n\n                             -4-\n\nas  separate  false declarations  \"require  different factual\n\nproof  of falsity,\" they \"may properly be charged in separate\n\ncounts even though they are all  related and arise out of the\n\nsame transaction.\"  United States v. Scott, 682 F.2d 695, 698\n                                          \n\n(8th  Cir. 1982); accord, e.g., United States v. De La Torre,\n                                                            \n\n634 F.2d 792, 795 (5th Cir.  Unit A Jan. 1981).  A comparison\n\nof  the three   1623 counts confirms that they satisfied this\n\nstandard.  Count 21 involved the factual issue of whether the\n\ntwo victims  were physically assaulted by the police.3  Count\n\n22  involved  defendant's awareness  of  a  second volley  of\n\ngunshots.4  And count 23 involved  the removal of the body of\n\none  of  the  victims.5     Each  of  the  defendant's  false\n\n                    \n\n3.  The questions and  answers involved in  Count 21 were  as\nfollows (the perjured testimony is underlined):\n\n     Q.   With respect to the  man who was taken  to the\n     hospital who  had been shooting at  the police, did\n     you see  anyone strike  or hit that  person at  any\n     time?\n     A.  No.\n            \n     Q.  Referring to the one who was just wounded?\n     A.  No.  Nobody was hit.\n                             \n\n4.  Count 22 involved the following testimony:\n\n     Q.   After the initial  shooting did  you hear  any\n     shots fired later?\n     A.  No, no fires--nothing was shot.\n                                        \n\n5.  Count 23 involved the following exchanges:\n\n     Q.   You testified about two  wounded persons being\n     taken from the scene.\n     A.  Yes.\n     Q.   One was the Undercover Agent and the other was\n     one of the persons who had been shooting at you.\n     A.  That's correct.  [continued next page]\n\n                             -5-\n\ndeclarations  plainly required  different  factual  proof  of\n\nfalsity.     Accordingly,   they  each   comprised   distinct\n\nviolations  of  law and  were  properly  charged as  separate\n\ncounts.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n              \n\n                    \n\n     Q.    Which of  the two  was  taken from  the scene\n     first?\n     A.  I would say the Undercover Agent because by the\n     time that  they removed  the other person  from the\n     embankment,  must have  taken  one  minute,  a  few\n     seconds.  All I know that when the Undercover Agent\n                                                        \n     was leaving, when the car was already leaving, they\n                                                        \n     were putting the other injured man inside the car.\n                                                       \n     Q.  And how  soon in fact  did the second car  with\n     the other injured man  leave after the vehicle with\n     the Agent had left?\n     A.    Another vehicle  was  in  the tower,  arrived\n                                                        \n     quickly.  It  must have  taken about  two or  three\n                                                        \n     minutes.  Was a matter of minutes.  As soon  as the\n                                                        \n     other vehicle  arrived, I  saw the man,  I saw  the\n                                                        \n     corpse being removed and they took him away.\n                                                 \n\n                             -6-\n",

Section 1623(c) reads in pertinent part:\n\n          An indictment or information for  violation of\n     this  section alleging  that,  in  any  proceedings\n     before or ancillary  to any court or  grand jury of\n     the  United States,  the defendant  under oath  has\n     knowingly made two or more declarations, which  are\n     inconsistent  to the  degree  that one  of them  is\n     necessarily   false,   need   not   specify   which\n     declaration is false if--\n               (1) each declaration was material to the\n     point in question, and\n               (2)  each declaration was made within the\n          period of  the statute of  limitations for the\n          offense charged under this section.\n     In  any prosecution under this section, the falsity\n     of  a declaration  set forth  in the  indictment or\n     information  shall  be  established sufficient  for\n     conviction by proof that the defendant  while under\n     oath made irreconcilably contradictory declarations\n     material to the point in question in any proceeding\n     before or ancillary to any court or grand jury.\n\n                             -3-\n\nonly  to \"irreconcilably  contradictory  declarations.\"    As\n\ndiscussed  below, the declarations giving rise to the three  \n\n1623 convictions  here were not  of this  nature.  We  see no\n\nstatutory bar to the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\n     Defendant  also contends  that the  three    1623 counts\n\ncharged the  same offense and were  therefore multiplicitous,\n\nwith  the  consequence  that the  imposition  of  consecutive\n\nsentences  violated  the  double  jeopardy clause.    In  two\n\nunpublished  decisions, we  have  rejected similar  arguments\n\nadvanced  by two  of  defendant's codefendants.   See  Moreno\n                                                             \n\nMorales v.

R. Crim. P.  12(b)(2).  As\n\ndefendant  failed to raise  this contention at  that time, it\n\nmust  be   deemed  waived.    See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nRodriguez,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  816-17  (1st  Cir. 1988);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Unit A Jan. 1981).  A comparison\n\nof  the three   1623 counts confirms that they satisfied this\n\nstandard.  Count 21 involved the factual issue of whether the\n\ntwo victims  were physically assaulted by the police.3  Count\n\n22  involved  defendant's awareness  of  a  second volley  of\n\ngunshots.4  And count 23 involved  the removal of the body of\n\none  of  the  victims.5     Each  of  the  defendant's  false\n\n                    \n\n3.  The questions and  answers involved in  Count 21 were  as\nfollows (the perjured testimony is underlined):\n\n     Q.   With respect to the  man who was taken  to the\n     hospital who  had been shooting at  the police, did\n     you see  anyone strike  or hit that  person at  any\n     time?\n     A.  No.\n            \n     Q.  Referring to the one who was just wounded?\n     A.  No.  Nobody was hit.\n                             \n\n4.  Count 22 involved the following testimony:\n\n     Q.   After the initial  shooting did  you hear  any\n     shots fired later?\n     A.  No, no fires--nothing was shot.\n                                        \n\n5.  Count 23 involved the following exchanges:\n\n     Q.   You testified about two  wounded persons being\n     taken from the scene.\n     A.  Yes.\n     Q.   One was the Undercover Agent and the other was\n     one of the persons who had been shooting at you.\n     A.  That's correct.  [continued next page]\n\n                             -5-\n\ndeclarations  plainly required  different  factual  proof  of\n\nfalsity.     Accordingly,   they  each   comprised   distinct\n\nviolations  of  law and  were  properly  charged as  separate\n\ncounts.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n              \n\n                    \n\n     Q.    Which of  the two  was  taken from  the scene\n     first?\n     A.  I would say the Undercover Agent because by the\n     time that  they removed  the other person  from the\n     embankment,  must have  taken  one  minute,  a  few\n     seconds.  All I know that when the Undercover Agent\n                                                        \n     was leaving, when the car was already leaving, they\n                                                        \n     were putting the other injured man inside the car.\n                                                       \n     Q.  And how  soon in fact  did the second car  with\n     the other injured man  leave after the vehicle with\n     the Agent had left?\n     A.    Another vehicle  was  in  the tower,  arrived\n                                                        \n     quickly.  It  must have  taken about  two or  three\n                                                        \n     minutes.  Was a matter of minutes.
