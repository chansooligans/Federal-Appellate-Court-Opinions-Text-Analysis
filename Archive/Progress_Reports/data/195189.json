Ramos-Barroso were on brief for appellees.\n                             \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.    Irma  Violeta  Davila  Cortes  sued  her\n                \n\ngynecologist,  Dr.   Antonio  Ramos   Barroso,  for   medical\n\nmalpractice,  alleging that  she was  injured  by Dr.  Ramos \n\nnegligence in performing a hysterectomy upon her on March 21,\n\n1989.  The case was tried to a jury in January  1993, and the\n\njury returned  a verdict for  the defendant.  On  February 2,\n\n1993, Davila moved for a new trial on the ground that  one of\n\nthe jurors, Ana  Teresa Gonzalez, had improperly  concealed a\n\nbusiness relationship with the defendant.\n\n     Davila's  claim is that  Gonzalez incorrectly answered a\n\nquestion by the trial judge  at voir dire, thereby precluding\n                                         \n\nplaintiff  from exercising her peremptory challenges in light\n\nof all  the relevant  facts.   Specifically, the  trial judge\n\nasked all of the prospective  jurors whether any of them were\n\n\"personally acquainted with this defendant, related to him by\n\nblood or marriage,  or [if any juror] or any  member of [her]\n\nimmediate family [had] any  connection of any kind with  this\n\ndefendant.\"   All  the  jurors  responded  in  the  negative.\n\n     Individual  questioning of  the jurors selected  for the\n\ntrial  panel  revealed  that  Gonzalez  was  employed  as  an\n\nassistant manager in the credit department of Medics Hospital\n\nSupply, a  business engaged  in selling  medical supplies  to\n\ndoctors,  patients,  and hospitals.    Although  Gonzalez has\n\nnever indicated that she had any direct relationship with the\n\ndefendant  Ramos, Davila learned  after trial that  Ramos had\n\n                             -2-\n\nbeen a client of either Medics or one of its sister companies\n\nfor at least ten years.1   On this basis Davila sought a  new\n\ntrial.\n\n     The  district court  denied Davila's  motion  for a  new\n\ntrial  on  the  grounds  that  \"[p]laintiff  has  offered  no\n\nevidence that the  defendant and the  juror in question  knew\n\neach  other or  that the  juror was  biased  in favor  of the\n\ndefendant.   In addition, the plaintiff had ample opportunity\n\nto question the juror during voir dire concerning whether she\n\nor   her  employer  had   any  business  dealings   with  the\n\ndefendant.\"   Davila moved for  reconsideration, pointing out\n\nthat   her  attorneys  were  precluded  by  local  rule  from\n\ninterviewing Gonzalez after trial and that voir dire had been\n                                                    \n\nconducted  by the court  without questioning by  the parties'\n\nattorneys.   The district  court denied  reconsideration, and\n\nthis appeal followed.\n\n     In McDonough  Power  Equipment, Inc.  v. Greenwood,  464\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 548, 556 (1984), the  Supreme Court held that \"to obtain\n\na  new trial  [based  on  a juror's  inaccurate  answer to  a\n\nquestion on voir dire], a party must first demonstrate that a\n                     \n\njuror failed  to answer honestly a material  question on voir\n                                                             \n\ndire, and  then further  show that  a correct  response would\n    \n\n                    \n\n     1Davila also  asserts that  Ramos' office  is two  doors\ndown the  block from  one of Medics'  branch offices  in Hato\nRey;  there is no evidence, however, that this was the office\nat which Gonzalez was employed.\n\n                             -3-\n\nhave provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\"   The\n\nreason for this requirement is  that \"[a] trial represents an\n\nimportant  investment of private and social resources, and it\n\nill serves  the important end  of finality to wipe  the slate\n\nclean simply  to recreate  the  peremptory challenge  process\n\nbecause  counsel   lacked  an   item  of  information   which\n\nobjectively he should have obtained from a juror on voir dire\n                                                             \n\nexamination.\" Id. at 555.     Our  circuit  has  held further\n                 \n\nthat \"[w]hen a non-frivolous  suggestion is made that  a jury\n\nmay be biased or tainted by some incident, the district court\n\nmust undertake an  adequate inquiry to determine  whether the\n\nalleged  incident  occurred   and  if  so,  whether   it  was\n\nprejudicial.\"   United States  v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n436, 442  (1st Cir.), petition  for cert. filed,  62 U.S.L.W.\n                                               \n\n3496 (November 26,  1993).  Nonetheless, \"[a]  district court\n\nhas  broad, though not unlimited, discretion to determine the\n\nextent and  nature of its  inquiry into allegations  of juror\n\nbias.\"  Id.  at 443.  Where the  allegations are unpersuasive\n           \n\non their face,  the district court s discretion  includes the\n\ndiscretion to undertake no investigation at all.\n\n     With  these  principles in  mind,  we find  no  abuse of\n\ndiscretion  in the district  court s refusal to  undertake an\n\ninvestigation of Davila's allegations.  As the district court\n\npointed out, there was no  evidence of any kind that Gonzalez\n\nknew Ramos.   Even if  we assume arguendo that  Gonzalez knew\n                                         \n\n                             -4-\n\nthat Ramos did  business with her employer, the  court's voir\n                                                             \n\ndire question  about \"any  connection of  any kind\"  was very\n    \n\ngeneral; and nothing in Davila's allegations  is inconsistent\n\nwith the view  that Gonzalez's answer was at  worst an honest\n\nmistake.  Cf. McDonough, 464  U.S. at 555 (\"To invalidate the\n                       \n\nresult  of  a 3-week  trial  because of  a  juror s mistaken,\n\nthough  honest,  response  to  a question,  is  to  insist on\n\nsomething closer to  perfection than our judicial  system can\n\nbe expected to give.\").  What Davila sought was permission to\n\nembark upon a fishing expedition, and on this record we think\n\nthat the district court was not obligated to go along.2\n\n     Any doubt in our minds is eliminated by Davila's failure\n\nat  voir dire  to inquire  into the  possibility of  business\n             \n\ndealings  between   Ramos  and  Gonzalez  after   the  latter\n\ndisclosed  that  she  worked for  a  medical  supply company.\n\nAlthough voir  dire  was conducted  by the  trial judge,  the\n                   \n\nparties had the opportunity to request that certain questions\n\nbe  put  to prospective  jurors.   Given Davila's  failure to\n\npursue a  possible  business  connection  between  Ramos  and\n\nGonzalez even  after it  was disclosed  that her  company was\n\nengaged in selling  medical supplies to  doctors, we are  not\n\n                    \n\n     2The Second Circuit reached an identical conclusion in a\nremarkably similar case,  holding that no inquiry  into juror\nbias was  required where a  juror failed to disclose  on voir\n                                                             \ndire that she was an officer at a bank that had dealings with\n    \nthe defendants.

Greenwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111065\"><a href=\"/opinion/111065/mcdonough-power-equipment-inc-v-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 556 (1984), the Supreme Court held that \"to obtain a new trial [based on a juror's inaccurate answer to a question on voir dire ], a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\"  The reason for this requirement is that \"[a] trial represents an important investment of private and social resources, and it ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have obtained from a juror on voir dire examination.\"   Id. at 555.  Our circuit has held further that \"[w]hen a non-frivolous suggestion is made that a jury may be biased or tainted by some incident, the district court must undertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged incident occurred and if so, whether it was prejudicial.\"   United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 442 (1st Cir.), petition for cert. filed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3496</span></span> (November 26, 1993).  Nonetheless, \"[a] district court has broad, though not unlimited, discretion to determine the extent and nature of its inquiry into allegations of juror bias.\"  Id. at 443.  Where the allegations are unpersuasive on their face, the district court's discretion includes the discretion to undertake no investigation at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to undertake an investigation of Davila's allegations.  As the district court pointed out, there was no evidence of any kind that Gonzalez knew Ramos.  Even if we assume arguendo that Gonzalez knew that Ramos did business with her employer, the court's voir dire question about \"any connection of any kind\" was very general;  and nothing in Davila's allegations is inconsistent with the view that Gonzalez's answer was at worst an honest mistake.   Cf. McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (\"To invalidate the result of a 3-week trial because of a juror's mistaken, though honest, response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.\").  What Davila sought was permission to embark upon a fishing expedition, and on this record we think that the district court was not obligated to go along.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any doubt in our minds is eliminated by Davila's failure at voir dire to inquire into the possibility of business dealings between Ramos and Gonzalez after the latter disclosed that she worked for a medical supply company.  Although voir dire was conducted by the trial judge, the parties had the opportunity to request that certain questions be put to prospective jurors.  Given Davila's failure to pursue a possible business connection between Ramos and Gonzalez even after it was disclosed that her company was engaged in selling medical supplies to doctors, we are not surprised that the district court viewed plaintiff's later attempt to revive the issue with a jaundiced eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Davila also asserts that Ramos' office is two doors down the block from one of Medics' branch offices in Hato Rey;  there is no evidence, however, that this was the office at which Gonzalez was employed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Second Circuit reached an identical conclusion in a remarkably similar case, holding that no inquiry into juror bias was required where a juror failed to disclose on voir dire that she was an officer at a bank that had dealings with the defendants.
