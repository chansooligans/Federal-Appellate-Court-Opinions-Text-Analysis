Appellants in  this case  are\n                           \n\nformer officers  of a failed bank.  They sued the FDIC as the\n\nbank's  receiver when  the FDIC  disallowed their  claims for\n\nseverance  pay  under their  contracts  with the  bank.   The\n\ndistrict court  sustained the  FDIC, reasoning that  Congress\n\nhad restricted such claims.  Although the statute in question\n\nis not easily construed  and the result  is a severe one,  we\n\nbelieve  that the officers'  claims fail, and  we sustain the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n     The facts, shorn of flourishes added by the parties, are\n\nsimple.  In  1988 and 1989, the four appellants  in this case\n\nwere   officers  of   Eliot   Savings   Bank   (\"Eliot\")   in\n\nMassachusetts.   In November 1988, when  Eliot was undergoing\n\nfinancial strain, Eliot made an agreement with Charles Noble,\n\nits  executive vice  president, committing  the bank  to make\n\nseverance  payments (computed under  a formula but apparently\n\nequivalent  to three  years' salary)  if his  employment were\n\nterminated.   In  August 1989,  the bank entered  into letter\n\nagreements  with  three   other  officers--appellants   Bruce\n\nHowell, Patricia McSweeney,  and Laurence  Richard--promising\n\nthem  each a  year's  salary as  severance  in the  event  of\n\ntermination.   Finally,  in  December 1989  a further  letter\n\nagreement  was  made  with  Noble,  reaffirming  the  earlier\n\nagreement with him while modifying it in certain respects.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     The agreements make clear that they were not intended to\n\nalter the \"at will\" employment relationship between Eliot and\n\nthe  officers.   The  bank  remained  free to  terminate  the\n\nofficers,  subject  to severance  payments,  and  (so far  as\n\nappears)  the officers were not bound to remain for any fixed\n\nterm.   The letter agreements  with the three  officers other\n\nthan Noble state that the severance payments were promised in\n\nconsideration of the officers' \"willingness to remain\" in the\n\nbank's  employ; and the same  intent can be  gleaned from the\n\ntwo agreements with Noble.   The weakened financial condition\n\nof  the  bank  is  adverted  to in  each  of  the  four  1989\n\nagreements.\n\n     At  some  point in  1989  the FDIC  began  to scrutinize\n\nclosely Eliot's affairs.  The officers allege, on information\n\nand  belief, that  the FDIC  and the  bank agreed  that Eliot\n\nwould take steps  to retain its qualified management; and the\n\ncomplaint  states that the  FDIC \"knew  and approved\"  of the\n\nfour  letter agreements  made  in 1989.    The officers  also\n\ncontend that they  were advised by  experienced counsel at  a\n\nrespected law  firm that the severance  agreements were valid\n\nand would withstand an  FDIC receivership if one ensued.   It\n\nis further alleged that,  in December 1989, the FDIC  and the\n\nbank entered into a consent order that provided that the bank\n\nwould continue to retain qualified management.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Eliot failed and was closed on June 29, 1990.   The FDIC\n\nwas  appointed its receiver.  Within two months, the officers\n\nwere  terminated.    The  officers  then  made administrative\n\nclaims  for their  severance benefits pursuant  to applicable\n\nprovisions  of  FIRREA, 12  U.S.C.      1821(d)(3), (5),  the\n\nstatute  enacted in  1989 to  cope with  the torrent  of bank\n\nfailures.1  In  October 1990, the FDIC disallowed the claims,\n\nstating  that the claims  violated public policy.    Although\n\nthe FDIC letter is not before us, it apparently is based upon\n\nthe FDIC's  general opposition  to what are  sometimes called\n\n\"golden  parachute  payments,\" a  subject  to  which we  will\n\nreturn.   Following  the disallowance,  the  officers pursued\n\ntheir  option,  expressly provided  by  FIRREA,  to bring  an\n\noriginal  action in  federal  district court.    12 U.S.C.   \n\n1821(d)(6).  \n\n     In their district court complaint, the officers asserted\n\nclaims against the FDIC for breach of contract, for breach of\n\nthe  contracts' implied  covenant  of fair  dealing, and  for\n\ndetrimental  reliance.   The  FDIC  moved to  dismiss  or for\n\nsummary judgment.  Thereafter, the  officers sought  to amend\n\ntheir complaint by adding a  promissory estoppel claim and by\n\n                    \n\n     1FIRREA is the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,\nand  Enforcement Act  of  1989, 103  Stat.  183, codified  in\nvarious sections of 12 and  18 U.S.C.   Among other  changes,\nFIRREA amended pre-existing  provisions specifying the FDIC's\npowers as receiver and the claims provisions governing claims\nagainst failed banks.  \n\n                             -4-\n\nexplicitly  naming the  FDIC in  its \"corporate  capacity\" as\n\nwell as  in its capacity as  receiver.  In  a bench decision,\n\nthe  district   judge  ruled  that  the   FDIC  had  lawfully\n\nrepudiated the  contracts between Eliot and  the officers and\n\nthat under FIRREA  there were no compensable  damages for the\n\nresulting breach.  As for the promissory estoppel  claim, the\n\ncourt deemed it  \"futile\" and refused to allow the amendment;\n\nthe  court referred  to the  general principle  that estoppel\n\ndoes  not operate  against the  government and to  the FDIC's\n\nbroad grant of  authority under  FIRREA.   The officers  then\n\nsought review in this court.\n\n     The first claim made on appeal, taken in order of logic,\n\nis that  the FDIC's  repudiation of the  severance agreements\n\nwas itself invalid.  At this point we need to explain briefly\n\nthe structure  of the statute.   Section 1821  governs, among\n\nother  matters, the powers of the FDIC as receiver, 12 U.S.C.\n\n  1821(d),  the procedure  for processing claims  against the\n\nfailed bank,  12 U.S.C.     1821(d)(3), (5),  and substantive\n\nrules for  contracts entered into prior  to the receivership.\n\n12 U.S.C.    1821(e).  Section 1821(e)(1) gives  the receiver\n\nthe right  to disaffirm  or repudiate  any contract  that the\n\nbank may have  made before receivership  if the FDIC  decides\n\n\"in its discretion\" that performance will be \"burdensome\" and\n\nthat disavowal  will \"promote the  orderly administration\" of\n\nthe failed bank's affairs.  12 U.S.C.   821(e)(1).  \n\n                             -5-\n\n     The  power of  a receiver  to repudiate  prior executory\n\ncontracts  made  by  the   debtor,  a  familiar  incident  of\n\nbankruptcy law, see 11 U.S.C.    365 (executory contracts and\n\nunexpired  leases), means  something less than  might appear.\n\nBy repudiating the contract the receiver is freed from having\n\nto comply  with the contract, e.g.,  American Medical Supply,\n                                                             \n\nInc.  v. FTC,  1990  U.S. Dist.  LEXIS  5355 (D.  Kan.  1990)\n            \n\n(specific enforcement),  but the repudiation is  treated as a\n\nbreach of  contract that gives  rise to an  ordinary contract\n\nclaim  for damages,  if  any.   Whether  that claim  is  then\n\n\"allowed\"  by the receiver and if so whether there are assets\n\nto satisfy it, are  distinct questions; at this point  we are\n\nconcerned  only with  the receiver's  authority to  affirm or\n\ndisaffirm.  In this case the officers do not dispute that the\n\nFDIC  did repudiate  the  severance agreements.   Rather  the\n\nofficers argue  that the repudiation is  ineffective, and the\n\nagreements remain enforceable, because  the FDIC did not make\n\nthe statutory findings, or abused its discretion, or both.\n\n     Interesting questions are posed by such a challenge, but\n\nthe questions need not be  resolved in this case.  The  claim\n\nwas  not made in the  district court and,  accordingly, it is\n\nwaived.  Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                         \n\nThe complaint  makes only  the barest  reference to  abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the FDIC, mentioning it not as a separate claim\n\nbut  in the prefatory description  of facts; and  there is no\n\n                             -6-\n\nreference  whatever to this line  of argument, or  to lack of\n\nrequired  FDIC  findings,  in  the opposition  filed  by  the\n\nofficers to the FDIC's  motion to dismiss.  A  litigant would\n\nnormally have an uphill battle in overturning an FDIC finding\n\nof  \"burden,\" if  the FDIC  made one,  but in all  events the\n\nissue has not been preserved in this case.\n\n     The second ground of  appeal raises the central question\n\nbefore  us,  namely,  whether  a  damage  claim  based  on  a\n\nrepudiated  severance contract  is allowed  under FIRREA.   A\n\nstranger to FIRREA might  think it apparent that breach  of a\n\ncontract  to make  severance payments  inflicts damages  on a\n\ndischarged employee  in the amount of  the promised payments.\n\nThe  hitch is  that  in FIRREA  Congress adopted  restrictive\n\nrules  that  limit  the   damages  permitted  for  repudiated\n\ncontracts.   12  U.S.C.    1821(e).   In a  general provision\n\nsubject  to certain exceptions,  12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(3)(A)(i)\n\nprovides  that  the  receiver's  liability  for  a repudiated\n\ncontract is \"limited to  actual direct compensatory damages .\n\n. . .\"  Additionally,  section 1821(e)(3)(B) provides:\n\n     For  purposes  of  subparagraph (A),  the  term  `actual\n     direct compensatory damages' does not include--\n          (i) punitive or exemplary damages;\n          (ii) damages for lost profits or opportunities; or\n          (iii) damages for pain and suffering.\n\n     The question thus framed is  whether, or to what extent,\n\nthe  statute's  limitation  to  \"actual  direct  compensatory\n\ndamages\" bars  the contractual severance claims  made in this\n\n                             -7-\n\ncase.2   The  question  is easy  to  state but  less easy  to\n\nanswer.   Although  FIRREA's concept  of  limiting  allowable\n\nclaims  for  contract  damages  echoes the  approach  of  the\n\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 502, that statute is more specific\n\nand  informative.   In particular,  section  502(b)(7) limits\n\nclaims by  a terminated  employee for future  compensation to\n\none year's pay.  So far as appears from the parties'  briefs,\n\nFIRREA's   broad   exclusionary   language  (\"actual   direct\n\ncompensatory  damages\") has  been plucked  out of the  air by\n\nCongress, although  the general  purpose is obvious  enough. \n\nIf   there  is   any  illuminating  legislative   history  or\n\nprecedent, it has  not been  called to our  attention by  the\n\nparties  and  we have  been  unable to  locate  anything very\n\nhelpful.\n\n     It  is   fair  to   guess  that  Congress,   faced  with\n\nmountainous bank  failures,  determined to  pare back  damage\n\nclaims founded  on repudiated contracts.   In all likelihood,\n\nthe legislators knew that many uninsured depositors and other\n\nunsecured creditors would recover  little from failed  banks;\n\nand the  government's own  liability (to  insured depositors)\n\nwould be  effectively increased to the  extent that remaining\n\nassets went  to contract-claim  creditors of the  bank rather\n\nthan  to the  government  (as the  subrogee  for the  insured\n\n                    \n\n     2We do  not reach  the FDIC's alternative  argument that\nthe  severance  pay would  be  barred  as representing  \"lost\nprofits or opportunity.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\ndepositors whom the FDIC  compensated directly).  It  is thus\n\nnot surprising  that Congress might wish  to disallow certain\n\ndamage claims  deemed less  worthy than  other claims.   This\n\nassessment   casts  some  light  on  Congress'  approach  and\n\nprovides a predicate for  considering the severance  contract\n\nclaims posed in this case.\n\n     We  conclude,  not  without some  misgivings,  that  the\n\nofficers'  claims  do  not  comprise allowable  claims  under\n\nFIRREA.   The amounts stipulated  by the Eliot  contracts are\n\neasily determined--a  formula payment for Noble  and a year's\n\npay for the others.  But the statute calls upon the courts to\n\ndetermine  the  nature  of  the  damages  stipulated  by  the\n                      \n\ncontract or sought by the  claimant in order to rule  out any\n\nbut  those permitted  by Congress.   In  this case,  analysis\n\npersuades us that the  damages provided by Eliot's repudiated\n\nseverance  contracts with  its  officers, and  sought by  the\n\nappellants  for their breach  in this  case, are  not \"actual\n\ndirect    compensatory   damages\"    under   12    U.S.C.    \n\n1821(e)(1)(A)(i).\n\n     Severance payments,  stipulated in advance, are  at best\n\nan  estimate  of  likely  harm  made  at  a  time  when  only\n\nprediction is possible.   When discharge actually occurs, the\n\nemployee may have no  way to prove the loss  from alternative\n\nemployments foregone, not to mention possible disputes  about\n\nthe  discharged  employee's ability  to  mitigate damages  by\n\n                             -9-\n\nfinding  new  employment.    A severance  agreement  properly\n\nprotects  against  these  uncertainties  by  liquidating  the\n\nliability.    Such  payments  comprise or  are  analogous  to\n\n\"liquidated damages,\"  at least  when  the amount  is not  so\n\nlarge  as  to  constitute  an  unenforceable  penalty.    See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  E. Allan  Farnsworth,  Contracts    12.18 (2d  ed.\n                                           \n\n1990); Charles McCormick, Damages   146 (1935).3\n                                 \n\n     Unfortunately   for   the   appellants,  the   statutory\n\nlanguage--\"actual  direct   compensatory  damages\"--does  not\n\nquite  embrace  the  payments  promised  by  the    officers'\n\nseverance agreements.  Eliot's officers may, or may not, have\n\nsuffered injury  by remaining at the bank,  depending on what\n\noptions  they had  in the  past that  are not  available now.\n\nConceivably,  they  suffered no  damage at  all; conceivably,\n\ntheir actual damages from staying at Eliot exceed the amounts\n\nstipulated  in the agreements.   The point  is that severance\n\npayments of this class do not comprise actual damages.  Thus,\n\nbased  on statutory  language alone,  the starting  point for\n\n                    \n\n     3Of course,  the other  office of a  severance agreement\nmay  be to provide a cause of  action for an at will employee\nwho otherwise has no contractual claim at all.  E.g., Pearson\n                                                             \nv. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.  Co., 979 F.2d 254, 258 (1st\n                                     \nCir.  1992).    In  this case,  the  at  will  status  of the\nappellants  is not decisive; they did  have contracts and our\ntask is  to  see  whether  the  promised  payments  fit  into\nFIRREA's compensable-damage pigeonhole.\n\n                             -10-\n\nstatutory construction,  the FDIC appears to  have the better\n\ncase.\n\n     One might  argue that, although  the severance  payments\n\nare not actual damages, they are often a good-faith effort to\n\nestimate such damages  and should in such  cases be permitted\n\nas  consistent with  the spirit  of the  statute, if  not its\n\nlanguage.   But the spirit of the statute is quite otherwise.\n\nThe statute actually excludes (see 12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(3)(B))\n\ntwo  less-favored categories of  what are indisputably actual\n\ndamages (lost  profits, pain and  suffering), reinforcing the\n\nimpression that Congress intended strictly to limit allowable\n\nclaims for repudiated contracts.   The treatment of leases in\n\nthe  next subsection  is  yet further  evidence of  Congress'\n\ntemper.    12  U.S.C.    1821(e)(4)  provides  that,  if  the\n\nreceiver disaffirms a lease to which the bank was lessee, the\n\nlessor's  damages are limited to past rent and loss of future\n\nrent is not compensable.  Yet the  lessor may have accepted a\n\nlower monthly  rent in  exchange for  a  long-term lease  and\n\nprotection  against the risk of  an empty building.   As with\n\nseverance   pay,  the   lessor   may   have  foregone   other\n\nopportunities but the loss is not to be recompensed.\n\n     Each side has offered in its favor still broader  policy\n\narguments.    The officers  claim  that  the disallowance  of\n\npromised severance pay will mean that a troubled  bank cannot\n\neffectively contract  to retain able officers  who may rescue\n\n                             -11-\n\nit.    The  FDIC,  by  contrast,  implies  that  the  present\n\narrangements may  be  \"golden parachutes\"  by which  insiders\n\ntake  advantage  of the  crisis  to  assure themselves  of  a\n\nhandsome  farewell gift from a  failing bank.   The FDIC also\n\npoints to regulations  it has proposed, but  not yet adopted,\n\nto curtail  severely such  arrangements; its new  rules would\n\ndisallow  severance contracts  for bank  officials except  in\n\nnarrowly  defined conditions,  such  as where  an officer  is\n\ninduced  to leave  another post  to help a  troubled thrift.4\n                 \n\nThe FDIC  claims that  the regulations and  their authorizing\n\nstatute reflect public policy.\n\n     The policy  arguments of the  officers and the  FDIC may\n\neach  have some force, to some extent they offset each other,\n\nand neither set is decisive  in this case.  In answer  to the\n\nofficers,  it may be said that their argument presents a fact\n\nand  policy question best left to Congress and to expert bank\n\nregulators;  those bodies  in turn  have ample  incentives to\n\nmake the right adjustment in delimiting severance agreements.\n\nAs  to  the  FDIC's   argument,  Congress  has  not  declared\n\nseverance payments unlawful but merely authorized the FDIC to\n\ndo so, and the  latter's proposed regulations are not  yet in\n\n                    \n\n     4The regulations  were proposed  on October 7,  1991, 56\nFed.  Reg. 50529,  pursuant to  the Comprehensive  Thrift and\nBank Fraud Prosection and Taxpayer Recovery  Act of 1990, 104\nStat. 4859, adding 12 U.S.C.   1828(k) (FDIC \"may prohibit or\nlimit, by regulation or order, any golden parachute payment .\n. . .\").\n\n                             -12-\n\nforce.  Further, this case arises on a motion  to dismiss, so\n\nthere  is no basis whatever for considering any imputation of\n\nbad motive or misconduct on the part of Eliot's officers.\n\n     The officers' last argument in support of their contract\n\nclaims is  that the \"actual  damage\" restriction, if  read as\n\nthe    FDIC   urges,    is   an    unconstitutional   taking.\n\nAlternatively, they say that  the statute is so close  to the\n\nline that  it should  be read  favorably to  them to avoid  a\n\nconstitutional question.   These  arguments were not  made in\n\nthe  district   court  and  we  decline   to  consider  them.\n\nLitigation  is a  winnowing process  and, except  in criminal\n\ncases where  the stakes are different,  only in extraordinary\n\ncircumstances  will we take up a contention that has not been\n\nmade in the district court.   We note that arguments that the\n\nFDIC might itself have made, but did not, have been similarly\n\nignored,  including   a   possible  claim   that  its   order\n                                                             \n\ndisallowing  the severance  claims  is a  currently effective\n\n\"order\"  under  the golden  parachute  statute,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(k).\n\n     What  remains  to  be  considered  are  the  detrimental\n\nreliance  claim in  the  original complaint  and the  related\n\npromissory   estoppel   claim  advanced   by   the  attempted\n\namendment.  In  substance, the officers argue  that the FDIC,\n\nacting in  its supervisory  or \"corporate\" capacity  prior to\n\nEliot's failure,  was so  closely associated with  the bank's\n\n                             -13-\n\nseverance  promises that  their  repudiation by  the FDIC  as\n\nreceiver  violates estoppel doctrine  or gives rise  to a new\n\nclaim  against the  FDIC.   That the  FDIC was  implicated in\n\nforming the  severance contracts  is  a factual  proposition,\n\napparently  denied  by  the  FDIC, but  we  must  accept  the\n\nproposition  as true for purposes of  reviewing the motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n     The  FDIC seeks  to  answer the  officers' estoppel  and\n\nreliance argument by citing  to cases that say that  the FDIC\n\nis  treated  as  two  separate  persons when  acting  in  its\n\n\"corporate\"  capacity as a  regulator and when  acting in its\n\ncapacity as receiver.  E.g., FDIC v. Roldon Fonseca, 795 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1102, 1109 (1st Cir. 1986).  On this theory, the  FDIC is not\n\nliable  in this  case  as regulator,  even  if it  affiliated\n\nitself with  the promise of  severance pay,  since \"it\"  (the\n\nFDIC  as  regulator)  did  not  break  the  promise;  and  as\n\nreceiver, the FDIC was free to disavow  the contracts because\n\n\"it\" (the FDIC as receiver) made no promises.  \n\n     The  officers  argue  that  this  \"separate  capacities\"\n\ndoctrine  was designed for a different purpose and should not\n\nbe  applied  in the  present  context  to produce  an  unjust\n\nresult.  But the Eighth Circuit applied this doctrine without\n\nmuch  hesitation  to a  case in  which  the FDIC  as receiver\n\nsought to repudiate a lease it had previously accepted in its\n\ncapacity as  \"conservator,\"   conservator  being yet  another\n\n                             -14-\n\nincarnation  in  which the  FDIC sometimes  appears.   RTC v.\n                                                          \n\nCedarMinn  Building Limited Partnership,  956 F.2d  1446 (8th\n                                       \n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  113  S. Ct.  94 (1992).    As for  the\n                    \n\nclaimed injustice, it is not clear that any apparent inequity\n\nworked in this  case is greater than occurs in the usual case\n\nin which  the separate-capacities doctrine is  invoked.  FDIC\n                                                             \n\nv. Roldon Fonseca, 795 F.2d at 1109.\n                 \n\n     There  is another  answer  to the  officers' claim  that\n\nrests more solidly on visible  policy.   Putting to one  side\n\nthe  separate  capacities  defense,  courts  are  for obvious\n\nreasons  reluctant  to permit  estoppels  against the  United\n\nStates,  e.g., Heckler  v. Services  of Crawford  County, 467\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 51, 60 (1984), although exceptions may be found.

There  are  many  reasons  for  the\n\nreluctance, including a  concern for the  public purse and  a\n\nrecognition that the government--unlike the  normal actor--is\n\nan enterprise  so vast  and complex  as  to preclude  perfect\n\nconsistency.  See generally  Hansen v. Harris, 619  F.2d 942,\n                                             \n\n649-58 (2d  Cir. 1980) (Friendly, J.,  dissenting), rev'd sub\n                                                             \n\nnom. Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785 (1981).  While leaving\n                        \n\nmany questions  unanswered, the Supreme Court  has made clear\n\nthat an estoppel against the United States is not measured by\n\nthe  rules used for ordinary litigants.  Heckler, 467 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n62.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     In the present  case, even the  most liberal reading  of\n\nthe reliance  and  estoppel counts  leaves  the FDIC  in  the\n\nposition of one who encouraged  or invited the bank's promise\n\nof severance pay.   Yet  (as we construe  the actual  damages\n\nclause), Congress  has decided that, in  parceling out fairly\n\nthe  limited  assets  of  a  failed  bank,  contract  damages\n\nreflecting  severance pay  are not  permitted.   \"[T]o permit\n\n[the claim]  . . . would  be judicially to admit  at the back\n\ndoor  that which  has been  legislatively turned away  at the\n\nfront  door.\"   FDIC  v.

It is hard to  imagine a less\n\nattractive case for creating a  new judicial exception to the\n\ngeneral rule against estoppel of the government.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                   \n\n                             -16-\n",

Appellants in  this case  are\n                           \n\nformer officers  of a failed bank.  They sued the FDIC as the\n\nbank's  receiver when  the FDIC  disallowed their  claims for\n\nseverance  pay  under their  contracts  with the  bank.   The\n\ndistrict court  sustained the  FDIC, reasoning that  Congress\n\nhad restricted such claims.  Although the statute in question\n\nis not easily construed  and the result  is a severe one,  we\n\nbelieve  that the officers'  claims fail, and  we sustain the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n     The facts, shorn of flourishes added by the parties, are\n\nsimple.  In  1988 and 1989, the four appellants  in this case\n\nwere   officers  of   Eliot   Savings   Bank   (\"Eliot\")   in\n\nMassachusetts.   In November 1988, when  Eliot was undergoing\n\nfinancial strain, Eliot made an agreement with Charles Noble,\n\nits  executive vice  president, committing  the bank  to make\n\nseverance  payments (computed under  a formula but apparently\n\nequivalent  to three  years' salary)  if his  employment were\n\nterminated.   In  August 1989,  the bank entered  into letter\n\nagreements  with  three   other  officers--appellants   Bruce\n\nHowell, Patricia McSweeney,  and Laurence  Richard--promising\n\nthem  each a  year's  salary as  severance  in the  event  of\n\ntermination.   Finally,  in  December 1989  a further  letter\n\nagreement  was  made  with  Noble,  reaffirming  the  earlier\n\nagreement with him while modifying it in certain respects.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     The agreements make clear that they were not intended to\n\nalter the \"at will\" employment relationship between Eliot and\n\nthe  officers.   The  bank  remained  free to  terminate  the\n\nofficers,  subject  to severance  payments,  and  (so far  as\n\nappears)  the officers were not bound to remain for any fixed\n\nterm.   The letter agreements  with the three  officers other\n\nthan Noble state that the severance payments were promised in\n\nconsideration of the officers' \"willingness to remain\" in the\n\nbank's  employ; and the same  intent can be  gleaned from the\n\ntwo agreements with Noble.   The weakened financial condition\n\nof  the  bank  is  adverted  to in  each  of  the  four  1989\n\nagreements.\n\n     At  some  point in  1989  the FDIC  began  to scrutinize\n\nclosely Eliot's affairs.  The officers allege, on information\n\nand  belief, that  the FDIC  and the  bank agreed  that Eliot\n\nwould take steps  to retain its qualified management; and the\n\ncomplaint  states that the  FDIC \"knew  and approved\"  of the\n\nfour  letter agreements  made  in 1989.    The officers  also\n\ncontend that they  were advised by  experienced counsel at  a\n\nrespected law  firm that the severance  agreements were valid\n\nand would withstand an  FDIC receivership if one ensued.   It\n\nis further alleged that,  in December 1989, the FDIC  and the\n\nbank entered into a consent order that provided that the bank\n\nwould continue to retain qualified management.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Eliot failed and was closed on June 29, 1990.   The FDIC\n\nwas  appointed its receiver.  Within two months, the officers\n\nwere  terminated.    The  officers  then  made administrative\n\nclaims  for their  severance benefits pursuant  to applicable\n\nprovisions  of  FIRREA, 12  U.S.C.      1821(d)(3), (5),  the\n\nstatute  enacted in  1989 to  cope with  the torrent  of bank\n\nfailures.1  In  October 1990, the FDIC disallowed the claims,\n\nstating  that the claims  violated public policy.    Although\n\nthe FDIC letter is not before us, it apparently is based upon\n\nthe FDIC's  general opposition  to what are  sometimes called\n\n\"golden  parachute  payments,\" a  subject  to  which we  will\n\nreturn.   Following  the disallowance,  the  officers pursued\n\ntheir  option,  expressly provided  by  FIRREA,  to bring  an\n\noriginal  action in  federal  district court.    12 U.S.C.   \n\n1821(d)(6).  \n\n     In their district court complaint, the officers asserted\n\nclaims against the FDIC for breach of contract, for breach of\n\nthe  contracts' implied  covenant  of fair  dealing, and  for\n\ndetrimental  reliance.   The  FDIC  moved to  dismiss  or for\n\nsummary judgment.  Thereafter, the  officers sought  to amend\n\ntheir complaint by adding a  promissory estoppel claim and by\n\n                    \n\n     1FIRREA is the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,\nand  Enforcement Act  of  1989, 103  Stat.  183, codified  in\nvarious sections of 12 and  18 U.S.C.   Among other  changes,\nFIRREA amended pre-existing  provisions specifying the FDIC's\npowers as receiver and the claims provisions governing claims\nagainst failed banks.  \n\n                             -4-\n\nexplicitly  naming the  FDIC in  its \"corporate  capacity\" as\n\nwell as  in its capacity as  receiver.  In  a bench decision,\n\nthe  district   judge  ruled  that  the   FDIC  had  lawfully\n\nrepudiated the  contracts between Eliot and  the officers and\n\nthat under FIRREA  there were no compensable  damages for the\n\nresulting breach.  As for the promissory estoppel  claim, the\n\ncourt deemed it  \"futile\" and refused to allow the amendment;\n\nthe  court referred  to the  general principle  that estoppel\n\ndoes  not operate  against the  government and to  the FDIC's\n\nbroad grant of  authority under  FIRREA.   The officers  then\n\nsought review in this court.\n\n     The first claim made on appeal, taken in order of logic,\n\nis that  the FDIC's  repudiation of the  severance agreements\n\nwas itself invalid.  At this point we need to explain briefly\n\nthe structure  of the statute.   Section 1821  governs, among\n\nother  matters, the powers of the FDIC as receiver, 12 U.S.C.\n\n  1821(d),  the procedure  for processing claims  against the\n\nfailed bank,  12 U.S.C.     1821(d)(3), (5),  and substantive\n\nrules for  contracts entered into prior  to the receivership.\n\n12 U.S.C.    1821(e).  Section 1821(e)(1) gives  the receiver\n\nthe right  to disaffirm  or repudiate  any contract  that the\n\nbank may have  made before receivership  if the FDIC  decides\n\n\"in its discretion\" that performance will be \"burdensome\" and\n\nthat disavowal  will \"promote the  orderly administration\" of\n\nthe failed bank's affairs.  12 U.S.C.   821(e)(1).  \n\n                             -5-\n\n     The  power of  a receiver  to repudiate  prior executory\n\ncontracts  made  by  the   debtor,  a  familiar  incident  of\n\nbankruptcy law, see 11 U.S.C.    365 (executory contracts and\n\nunexpired  leases), means  something less than  might appear.\n\nBy repudiating the contract the receiver is freed from having\n\nto comply  with the contract, e.g.,  American Medical Supply,\n                                                             \n\nInc.  v. FTC,  1990  U.S. Dist.  LEXIS  5355 (D.  Kan.  1990)\n            \n\n(specific enforcement),  but the repudiation is  treated as a\n\nbreach of  contract that gives  rise to an  ordinary contract\n\nclaim  for damages,  if  any.   Whether  that claim  is  then\n\n\"allowed\"  by the receiver and if so whether there are assets\n\nto satisfy it, are  distinct questions; at this point  we are\n\nconcerned  only with  the receiver's  authority to  affirm or\n\ndisaffirm.  In this case the officers do not dispute that the\n\nFDIC  did repudiate  the  severance agreements.   Rather  the\n\nofficers argue  that the repudiation is  ineffective, and the\n\nagreements remain enforceable, because  the FDIC did not make\n\nthe statutory findings, or abused its discretion, or both.\n\n     Interesting questions are posed by such a challenge, but\n\nthe questions need not be  resolved in this case.  The  claim\n\nwas  not made in the  district court and,  accordingly, it is\n\nwaived.  Clauson v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491456\"><a href=\"/opinion/491456/charles-clauson-v-robert-d-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                         \n\nThe complaint  makes only  the barest  reference to  abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the FDIC, mentioning it not as a separate claim\n\nbut  in the prefatory description  of facts; and  there is no\n\n                             -6-\n\nreference  whatever to this line  of argument, or  to lack of\n\nrequired  FDIC  findings,  in  the opposition  filed  by  the\n\nofficers to the FDIC's  motion to dismiss.  A  litigant would\n\nnormally have an uphill battle in overturning an FDIC finding\n\nof  \"burden,\" if  the FDIC  made one,  but in all  events the\n\nissue has not been preserved in this case.\n\n     The second ground of  appeal raises the central question\n\nbefore  us,  namely,  whether  a  damage  claim  based  on  a\n\nrepudiated  severance contract  is allowed  under FIRREA.   A\n\nstranger to FIRREA might  think it apparent that breach  of a\n\ncontract  to make  severance payments  inflicts damages  on a\n\ndischarged employee  in the amount of  the promised payments.\n\nThe  hitch is  that  in FIRREA  Congress adopted  restrictive\n\nrules  that  limit  the   damages  permitted  for  repudiated\n\ncontracts.   12  U.S.C.    1821(e).   In a  general provision\n\nsubject  to certain exceptions,  12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(3)(A)(i)\n\nprovides  that  the  receiver's  liability  for  a repudiated\n\ncontract is \"limited to  actual direct compensatory damages .\n\n. . .\"  Additionally,  section 1821(e)(3)(B) provides:\n\n     For  purposes  of  subparagraph (A),  the  term  `actual\n     direct compensatory damages' does not include--\n          (i) punitive or exemplary damages;\n          (ii) damages for lost profits or opportunities; or\n          (iii) damages for pain and suffering.\n\n     The question thus framed is  whether, or to what extent,\n\nthe  statute's  limitation  to  \"actual  direct  compensatory\n\ndamages\" bars  the contractual severance claims  made in this\n\n                             -7-\n\ncase.2   The  question  is easy  to  state but  less easy  to\n\nanswer.   Although  FIRREA's concept  of  limiting  allowable\n\nclaims  for  contract  damages  echoes the  approach  of  the\n\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 502, that statute is more specific\n\nand  informative.   In particular,  section  502(b)(7) limits\n\nclaims by  a terminated  employee for future  compensation to\n\none year's pay.  So far as appears from the parties'  briefs,\n\nFIRREA's   broad   exclusionary   language  (\"actual   direct\n\ncompensatory  damages\") has  been plucked  out of the  air by\n\nCongress, although  the general  purpose is obvious  enough. \n\nIf   there  is   any  illuminating  legislative   history  or\n\nprecedent, it has  not been  called to our  attention by  the\n\nparties  and  we have  been  unable to  locate  anything very\n\nhelpful.\n\n     It  is   fair  to   guess  that  Congress,   faced  with\n\nmountainous bank  failures,  determined to  pare back  damage\n\nclaims founded  on repudiated contracts.   In all likelihood,\n\nthe legislators knew that many uninsured depositors and other\n\nunsecured creditors would recover  little from failed  banks;\n\nand the  government's own  liability (to  insured depositors)\n\nwould be  effectively increased to the  extent that remaining\n\nassets went  to contract-claim  creditors of the  bank rather\n\nthan  to the  government  (as the  subrogee  for the  insured\n\n                    \n\n     2We do  not reach  the FDIC's alternative  argument that\nthe  severance  pay would  be  barred  as representing  \"lost\nprofits or opportunity.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\ndepositors whom the FDIC  compensated directly).  It  is thus\n\nnot surprising  that Congress might wish  to disallow certain\n\ndamage claims  deemed less  worthy than  other claims.   This\n\nassessment   casts  some  light  on  Congress'  approach  and\n\nprovides a predicate for  considering the severance  contract\n\nclaims posed in this case.\n\n     We  conclude,  not  without some  misgivings,  that  the\n\nofficers'  claims  do  not  comprise allowable  claims  under\n\nFIRREA.   The amounts stipulated  by the Eliot  contracts are\n\neasily determined--a  formula payment for Noble  and a year's\n\npay for the others.  But the statute calls upon the courts to\n\ndetermine  the  nature  of  the  damages  stipulated  by  the\n                      \n\ncontract or sought by the  claimant in order to rule  out any\n\nbut  those permitted  by Congress.   In  this case,  analysis\n\npersuades us that the  damages provided by Eliot's repudiated\n\nseverance  contracts with  its  officers, and  sought by  the\n\nappellants  for their breach  in this  case, are  not \"actual\n\ndirect    compensatory   damages\"    under   12    U.S.C.    \n\n1821(e)(1)(A)(i).\n\n     Severance payments,  stipulated in advance, are  at best\n\nan  estimate  of  likely  harm  made  at  a  time  when  only\n\nprediction is possible.   When discharge actually occurs, the\n\nemployee may have no  way to prove the loss  from alternative\n\nemployments foregone, not to mention possible disputes  about\n\nthe  discharged  employee's ability  to  mitigate damages  by\n\n                             -9-\n\nfinding  new  employment.    A severance  agreement  properly\n\nprotects  against  these  uncertainties  by  liquidating  the\n\nliability.    Such  payments  comprise or  are  analogous  to\n\n\"liquidated damages,\"  at least  when  the amount  is not  so\n\nlarge  as  to  constitute  an  unenforceable  penalty.    See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  E. Allan  Farnsworth,  Contracts    12.18 (2d  ed.\n                                           \n\n1990); Charles McCormick, Damages   146 (1935).3\n                                 \n\n     Unfortunately   for   the   appellants,  the   statutory\n\nlanguage--\"actual  direct   compensatory  damages\"--does  not\n\nquite  embrace  the  payments  promised  by  the    officers'\n\nseverance agreements.  Eliot's officers may, or may not, have\n\nsuffered injury  by remaining at the bank,  depending on what\n\noptions  they had  in the  past that  are not  available now.\n\nConceivably,  they  suffered no  damage at  all; conceivably,\n\ntheir actual damages from staying at Eliot exceed the amounts\n\nstipulated  in the agreements.   The point  is that severance\n\npayments of this class do not comprise actual damages.  Thus,\n\nbased  on statutory  language alone,  the starting  point for\n\n                    \n\n     3Of course,  the other  office of a  severance agreement\nmay  be to provide a cause of  action for an at will employee\nwho otherwise has no contractual claim at all.  E.g., Pearson\n                                                             \nv. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.  Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594698\"><a href=\"/opinion/594698/harold-f-pearson-iii-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1st\n                                     \nCir.  1992).    In  this case,  the  at  will  status  of the\nappellants  is not decisive; they did  have contracts and our\ntask is  to  see  whether  the  promised  payments  fit  into\nFIRREA's compensable-damage pigeonhole.\n\n                             -10-\n\nstatutory construction,  the FDIC appears to  have the better\n\ncase.\n\n     One might  argue that, although  the severance  payments\n\nare not actual damages, they are often a good-faith effort to\n\nestimate such damages  and should in such  cases be permitted\n\nas  consistent with  the spirit  of the  statute, if  not its\n\nlanguage.   But the spirit of the statute is quite otherwise.\n\nThe statute actually excludes (see 12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(3)(B))\n\ntwo  less-favored categories of  what are indisputably actual\n\ndamages (lost  profits, pain and  suffering), reinforcing the\n\nimpression that Congress intended strictly to limit allowable\n\nclaims for repudiated contracts.   The treatment of leases in\n\nthe  next subsection  is  yet further  evidence of  Congress'\n\ntemper.    12  U.S.C.    1821(e)(4)  provides  that,  if  the\n\nreceiver disaffirms a lease to which the bank was lessee, the\n\nlessor's  damages are limited to past rent and loss of future\n\nrent is not compensable.  Yet the  lessor may have accepted a\n\nlower monthly  rent in  exchange for  a  long-term lease  and\n\nprotection  against the risk of  an empty building.   As with\n\nseverance   pay,  the   lessor   may   have  foregone   other\n\nopportunities but the loss is not to be recompensed.\n\n     Each side has offered in its favor still broader  policy\n\narguments.    The officers  claim  that  the disallowance  of\n\npromised severance pay will mean that a troubled  bank cannot\n\neffectively contract  to retain able officers  who may rescue\n\n                             -11-\n\nit.    The  FDIC,  by  contrast,  implies  that  the  present\n\narrangements may  be  \"golden parachutes\"  by which  insiders\n\ntake  advantage  of the  crisis  to  assure themselves  of  a\n\nhandsome  farewell gift from a  failing bank.   The FDIC also\n\npoints to regulations  it has proposed, but  not yet adopted,\n\nto curtail  severely such  arrangements; its new  rules would\n\ndisallow  severance contracts  for bank  officials except  in\n\nnarrowly  defined conditions,  such  as where  an officer  is\n\ninduced  to leave  another post  to help a  troubled thrift.4\n                 \n\nThe FDIC  claims that  the regulations and  their authorizing\n\nstatute reflect public policy.\n\n     The policy  arguments of the  officers and the  FDIC may\n\neach  have some force, to some extent they offset each other,\n\nand neither set is decisive  in this case.  In answer  to the\n\nofficers,  it may be said that their argument presents a fact\n\nand  policy question best left to Congress and to expert bank\n\nregulators;  those bodies  in turn  have ample  incentives to\n\nmake the right adjustment in delimiting severance agreements.\n\nAs  to  the  FDIC's   argument,  Congress  has  not  declared\n\nseverance payments unlawful but merely authorized the FDIC to\n\ndo so, and the  latter's proposed regulations are not  yet in\n\n                    \n\n     4The regulations  were proposed  on October 7,  1991, 56\nFed.  Reg. 50529,  pursuant to  the Comprehensive  Thrift and\nBank Fraud Prosection and Taxpayer Recovery  Act of 1990, 104\nStat. 4859, adding 12 U.S.C.   1828(k) (FDIC \"may prohibit or\nlimit, by regulation or order, any golden parachute payment .\n. . .\").\n\n                             -12-\n\nforce.  Further, this case arises on a motion  to dismiss, so\n\nthere  is no basis whatever for considering any imputation of\n\nbad motive or misconduct on the part of Eliot's officers.\n\n     The officers' last argument in support of their contract\n\nclaims is  that the \"actual  damage\" restriction, if  read as\n\nthe    FDIC   urges,    is   an    unconstitutional   taking.\n\nAlternatively, they say that  the statute is so close  to the\n\nline that  it should  be read  favorably to  them to avoid  a\n\nconstitutional question.   These  arguments were not  made in\n\nthe  district   court  and  we  decline   to  consider  them.\n\nLitigation  is a  winnowing process  and, except  in criminal\n\ncases where  the stakes are different,  only in extraordinary\n\ncircumstances  will we take up a contention that has not been\n\nmade in the district court.   We note that arguments that the\n\nFDIC might itself have made, but did not, have been similarly\n\nignored,  including   a   possible  claim   that  its   order\n                                                             \n\ndisallowing  the severance  claims  is a  currently effective\n\n\"order\"  under  the golden  parachute  statute,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(k).\n\n     What  remains  to  be  considered  are  the  detrimental\n\nreliance  claim in  the  original complaint  and the  related\n\npromissory   estoppel   claim  advanced   by   the  attempted\n\namendment.  In  substance, the officers argue  that the FDIC,\n\nacting in  its supervisory  or \"corporate\" capacity  prior to\n\nEliot's failure,  was so  closely associated with  the bank's\n\n                             -13-\n\nseverance  promises that  their  repudiation by  the FDIC  as\n\nreceiver  violates estoppel doctrine  or gives rise  to a new\n\nclaim  against the  FDIC.   That the  FDIC was  implicated in\n\nforming the  severance contracts  is  a factual  proposition,\n\napparently  denied  by  the  FDIC, but  we  must  accept  the\n\nproposition  as true for purposes of  reviewing the motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n     The  FDIC seeks  to  answer the  officers' estoppel  and\n\nreliance argument by citing  to cases that say that  the FDIC\n\nis  treated  as  two  separate  persons when  acting  in  its\n\n\"corporate\"  capacity as a  regulator and when  acting in its\n\ncapacity as receiver.  E.g., FDIC v.

On this theory, the  FDIC is not\n\nliable  in this  case  as regulator,  even  if it  affiliated\n\nitself with  the promise of  severance pay,  since \"it\"  (the\n\nFDIC  as  regulator)  did  not  break  the  promise;  and  as\n\nreceiver, the FDIC was free to disavow  the contracts because\n\n\"it\" (the FDIC as receiver) made no promises.  \n\n     The  officers  argue  that  this  \"separate  capacities\"\n\ndoctrine  was designed for a different purpose and should not\n\nbe  applied  in the  present  context  to produce  an  unjust\n\nresult.  But the Eighth Circuit applied this doctrine without\n\nmuch  hesitation  to a  case in  which  the FDIC  as receiver\n\nsought to repudiate a lease it had previously accepted in its\n\ncapacity as  \"conservator,\"   conservator  being yet  another\n\n                             -14-\n\nincarnation  in  which the  FDIC sometimes  appears.
