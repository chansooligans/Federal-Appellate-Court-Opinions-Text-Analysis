The  district court  upheld the\n\nUSDA policy of counting as income for food stamp purposes the\n\nutility reimbursements plaintiffs receive from the Department\n\nof  Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) and from the Farmers\n\nHome  Administration  (FmHA).

Plaintiffs are  a class  of tenants  receiving food\n\nstamps,  paying for  household utilities,  and living  in HUD\n\npublic housing,  in privately-owned \"Section  8\" HUD-assisted\n\napartments,  and  in privately-owned  FmHA-assisted housing.1\n\n                    \n\n1The class includes\n          [a]ll the persons  in the State  of Maine who  will\n          receive  or  who  have  received  FmHA  and/or  HUD\n          utility  [reimbursements]  anytime  since March  1,\n          1990 and whose  food stamp benefits were or will be\n\n                             -2-\n\n          Plaintiffs,  as  tenants in  HUD and  FmHA housing,\n\nreceive  monthly  payments, called  \"utility reimbursements,\"\n\nbecause  all of  their utilities  are not  included in  their\n\nrent, and  because their monthly income is  very low relative\n\nto  average utility costs in their communities.  The issue on\n\nappeal is  whether USDA  may count utility  reimbursements as\n\nincome  under  the Food  Stamp  Act, 7  U.S.C.     2011-2032,\n\nalthough section 2014(d)(11)(A) of the Act expressly excludes\n\n\"energy assistance\" payments from food stamp income.\n\n                     A.  Food Stamp Act \n                     A.  Food Stamp Act\n\n          The Food Stamp Act establishes  a federally-funded,\n\nstate-administered  program  to  alleviate  malnutrition  and\n\nhunger in  low income  households by providing  needy persons\n\nwith coupons to purchase food from  retail stores.  See id.  \n                                                           \n\n2011;  Massachusetts v.  Lyng,  893 F.2d  424, 425  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1990); West v.  Bowen, 879  F.2d 1122, 1124  (3d Cir.  1989).\n                     \n\nUSDA   establishes   uniform   standards   for   food   stamp\n\neligibility.  See 7 U.S.C.   2014(b).  Eligibility depends on\n                 \n\nincome.  \"Income\" is defined as money payable to a household,\n\nfrom  whatever   source,  subject   to  the   exclusions  and\n\ndeductions in the Act.

HUD and FmHA Utility Reimbursements\n\n          To   frame   an   analysis   of   whether   utility\n\nreimbursements are  \"energy assistance\" under  the Food Stamp\n\nAct, we  outline the  regulations  on utility  reimbursements\n\nunder the FmHA rental assistance  program and the HUD section\n\n8 and  public housing programs.  In  relevant respects, these\n\nregulations are identical.   Tenants in HUD  and FmHA housing\n\npay no more  than 30% of  household income for  rent plus  an\n\nallowance  for any  utilities not  supplied by  the landlord.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C.    1437a(a)(1);  7 C.F.R. pt.  1930, subpt.  C,\n   \n\nexhs. B.IV.A.2.c, E.II.E.  Water, sewerage, trash collection,\n\nelectricity, cooking fuel, heat,  and hot water are utilities\n\nfor  which allowances may be  established.  See  24 C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n813.102, 965.472, 965.476; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt. E, exhs.\n\nA-5, A-6.   The FmHA utility  allowance reflects the  utility\n\ncosts incurred by the majority of households in similar units\n\nin a housing complex.  See  7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt. E, exh.\n                          \n\nA-6.I, -6.II.  HUD utility allowances represent a \"reasonable\n\n                             -4-\n\nconsumption\"   of   utilities   \"by  an   energy-conservative\n\nhousehold   of  modest  circumstances   consistent  with  the\n\nrequirements  of  a  safe,  sanitary  and  healthful   living\n\nenvironment.\"  24 C.F.R.    813.102, 965.476(a).       \n\n          To prevent tenants who  pay for their own utilities\n\nfrom  generally incurring  excessive utility  costs, HUD  and\n\nFmHA  regulations permit rent (capped at 30% of income) to be\n\noffset  by  an allowance  for utilities.    See 24  C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n813.102, 913.102; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt. C, exh. E.IX.A.1.\n\nThis  set  off  results  in  a   payment  called  a  \"utility\n\nreimbursement\"  whenever  monthly  income  is  very  low  and\n\nutility costs  are relatively high.   A utility reimbursement\n\nis equal to the sum  of all allowances for any  utilities not\n\nsupplied by the landlord minus 30% of monthly income.  See 24\n                                                          \n\nC.F.R.    813.102, 913.102; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt. C, exh.\n\nE.IX.A.2. \n\n          For example, if a  tenant's monthly income is $100,\n\n$30 (30%) is the total amount the tenant must pay for housing\n\ncosts,  including  any utility  allowance.    If the  utility\n\nallowance  is  $5, the  tenant  will  not  receive a  utility\n\nreimbursement, but will owe the landlord only $25 because the\n\nallowance is credited against the total amount due.  A tenant\n\nwith the same monthly income, but with a utility allowance of\n\n$50, will pay the landlord no rent and will receive a utility\n\nreimbursement  of $20  (the  utility allowance  minus 30%  of\n\n                             -5-\n\n$100).   Every  tenant  entitled to  a utility  reimbursement\n\nreceives  a  bill from  at least  one  utility company.   The\n\nreimbursement ensures  that FmHA  and HUD tenants,  living in\n\nvery poor households, will not generally pay more than 30% of\n\nhousehold  income for  energy,  water,  sewerage,  and  trash\n\ncollection costs.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs  argue  that utility  reimbursements are\n\n\"energy assistance,\"  and that section  2014(d)(11)(A) of the\n\nFood  Stamp   Act  exempts   such   assistance  from   income\n\ncalculations.  USDA contends  that this provision,  excluding\n\nfrom  food  stamp income  \"any  payments for  the  purpose of\n\nproviding energy assistance,\" is inapplicable because \"energy\n\nassistance\"  is limited  to payments  made to  offset rapidly\n\nrising  energy  costs, whereas  utility  reimbursements cover\n\nroutine utility costs.2\n\n                    \n\n2Courts  have  split  over  whether USDA  may  count  utility\nreimbursements as income.  See, e.g., West v.

Standard of Review\n\n          A  court reviewing an  agency's interpretation of a\n\nstatute it administers must first determine whether  Congress\n\nhas  spoken  to the  \"precise  question at  issue.\"   Chevron\n                                                             \n\nU.S.A. v.

The precise question in this case is whether \"energy\n\nassistance\"  under  section  2014(d)(11)(A) encompasses  only\n\npayments offsetting rapidly rising energy costs.   Cf. id. at\n                                                          \n\n840, 845  (noting that precise  question at issue  is whether\n\nEPA's plantwide definition of \"stationary source\" applies  to\n\na statute  requiring permits  for new or  modified stationary\n\nsources  of air  pollution).   If Congress's  intent on  this\n\nquestion is  clear, \"that is the  end of the  matter; for the\n\ncourt,  as  well  as the  agency,  must  give  effect to  the\n\nunambiguously expressed intent of  Congress.\"  Id. at 842-43.\n                                                  \n\nOur  review  of  the  district court's  construction  of  the\n\nstatute is de novo.  See Lyng, 893 F.2d at 428.  \n                             \n\n          In determining congressional  intent, we employ the\n\ntraditional  tools of  statutory  construction,  including  a\n\nconsideration  of  the  language,  structure,   purpose,  and\n\nhistory  of the  statute.   See Dion  v. Commissioner,  Maine\n                                                             \n\nDep't of Human Servs., 933 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.  1991).  Our\n                     \n\ninquiry begins with an  examination of the relevant statutory\n\n                    \n\nHuman  Res. v. USDA, 976 F.2d 1462 (4th Cir. 1992) (upholding\n                   \nUSDA's  interpretation  of  exclusion  for  energy assistance\nprovided under state or local laws). \n\n                             -7-\n\nlanguage.  American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 68\n                                            \n\n(1982).     To   be  excluded   from  income   under  section\n\n2014(d)(11)(A), a payment must be  \"for the purpose of energy\n\nassistance.\"   The  Act  provides no  definition for  \"energy\n\nassistance,\"  but its  meaning  is generally  understood.   A\n\npayment  that  provides  \"assistance\" commonly  refers  to  a\n\npublic  subsidy; for  example:    housing assistance,  rental\n\nassistance,  and  medical  assistance  payments.   We  assume\n\n\"`that the  legislative purpose is expressed  by the ordinary\n\nmeaning  of the words used.'\"  American Tobacco Co., 456 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat  68 (citation omitted).  In the absence of a manifestation\n\nof  legislative  intent to  the  contrary,  we conclude  that\n\n\"energy assistance\" means what it says:  a public subsidy for\n\nthe purchase of energy.  \n\n          Under  this  plain reading  of  the  provision, the\n\nplaintiffs  have  no  colorable  claim  unless their  utility\n\nreimbursements  are  subsidies  for  energy.   FmHA  and  HUD\n\nutility  allowances account  for nonenergy utilities  such as\n\nwater,  sewerage, and  trash  collection, as  well as  energy\n\nutilities including  heat, electricity, natural gas,  and hot\n\nwater.    A  tenant  directly liable  for  certain  utilities\n\nreceives  a  utility reimbursement  only  if the  sum  of the\n\nallowances  for  these  utilities  exceeds  30% of  household\n\nincome.     Therefore,  a  utility   reimbursement  does  not\n\nsubsidize energy  purchases unless  the tenant pays  at least\n\n                             -8-\n\none energy company for  the services provided.   Otherwise, a\n\nutility reimbursement is not an energy subsidy at all because\n\nit assiststhe tenantonly inpaying nonenergyutility providers.\n\n          In   response  to  the  Secretary's  argument  that\n\nutility reimbursements can never be energy assistance because\n\nthey might offset nonenergy utility costs, plaintiffs contend\n\nthat  utility reimbursements  are  always  energy  assistance\n\nbecause  they are  intended  \"primarily\" for  the payment  of\n\nenergy  bills.   A  committee  report  discussing the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion states  that  benefits provided  by the\n\nHome   Energy   Assistance  Act,   and   the  Energy   Crisis\n\nIntervention  and  Energy  Crisis  Assistance  Programs,  are\n\n\"energy assistance.\"  See  H.R. Rep. No. 788, 96th  Cong., 2d\n                         \n\nSess. 122-23 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 843, 955-\n                                 \n\n56.    Because  these  programs historically  provided  food,\n\nmedicine, and rental assistance,  as well as direct subsidies\n\nfor  fuel bills,  plaintiffs  contend that  Congress did  not\n\nintend \"energy  assistance\"  to  include  payments  only  for\n\nenergy utilities.  \n\n          Plaintiffs  fail  to  acknowledge   the  difference\n\nbetween  their   utility  reimbursements  and   the  benefits\n\nprovided under  the programs  discussed in the  House Report.\n\nAccording  to the report,  these programs provided assistance\n\nto offset the impact of high energy costs.  See id.; see also\n                                                             \n\n45 C.F.R.    1061.51-6(a), 1061.70-8.  At issue in this case,\n\n                             -9-\n\nhowever, are utility reimbursements that are designed in part\n\nto  offset nonenergy utility costs.  The analogy suggested by\n\nplaintiffs  is thus  not  apt; it  does  not clarify  whether\n\npayments designed  to account  for  a mixture  of energy  and\n\nnonenergy  expenses  are  \"energy assistance.\"    Neither the\n\nenergy  assistance   exclusion's  plain  language,   nor  its\n\nlegislative  history evince  an  intent  to exclude  payments\n\nprovided primarily for the purpose of energy assistance.  For\n                  \n\nthis reason,  we decline  plaintiffs' invitation to  read the\n\nword \"primarily\" or its equivalent into the statute.\n\n          The  Secretary argues that  a utility reimbursement\n\ncan never be a subsidy for the purchase of energy because the\n         \n\nallowance  may  be  based exclusively  on  nonenergy  utility\n\ncosts.   In all likelihood,  however, part of  every tenant's\n\nutility reimbursement is  based on an energy-related  utility\n\nallowance.     In   fact,  some   tenants   receive   utility\n\nreimbursements only  for energy utilities.   Named  plaintiff\n\nFelix St.  Peter's utility  reimbursement, for example,  is a\n\ntwo  party check made jointly payable to him and Maine Public\n\nService  Company.     See  24  C.F.R.       813.108,  913.108\n                         \n\n(providing  that  HUD  utility  reimbursements  may  be  made\n\npayable  to utility  providers).   The  energy and  nonenergy\n\ncomponents  of  a utility  allowance  are  itemized when  the\n\nallowance  is approved by FmHA and  HUD; this information may\n\nbe used to determine what fraction of a utility reimbursement\n\n                             -10-\n\nis energy-related.   FmHA  regulations require a  landlord to\n\nlist each  utility  allowance separately  when  seeking  FmHA\n\napproval for  the allowance, and to  provide this information\n\nto the tenant.  7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt. E,  exh. A-6.III to\n\n-A.6.V.   The  local public  housing agency  operating a  HUD\n\npublic housing project must maintain similar lists of utility\n\nallowances, and this information  is available to the tenant.\n\n24 C.F.R.    965.473, 965.474.  Although  HUD regulations for\n\nsection  8 privately-owned housing  do not explicitly require\n\nthat itemized  information on utility  allowances be retained\n\nfor  the  tenant,  this  is the  implication  of  regulations\n\nrequiring that HUD or the local public housing agency approve\n\nproposed allowances and that  allowances be reviewed annually\n\nfor  adjustments.    See,  e.g.,  id.      813.102,  882.116,\n                                     \n\n882.214.  We  assume that  HUD and the  local public  housing\n\nagency would  retain records of utility  allowances and would\n\nmake  this information  available  to the  tenant whose  rent\n\ndepends on that allowance. \n\n          Such information may be  used to determine how much\n\nof  a utility reimbursement is  in fact a  subsidy for energy\n\ncosts.  See South  Dakota Dep't of Soc. Servs.,  824 F. Supp.\n                                              \n\nat 1477  (\"computing the energy and  non-energy components of\n\n[utility   reimbursements]  would  be   a  simple  matter  of\n\narithmetic, not a great administrative burden\").

According  to  a construction  of  the\n\nstatute consistent with  its plain language, only  40% of the\n\nreimbursement may  be counted as income under  the Food Stamp\n\nAct.\n\n                             -12-\n\n     B.  Structure of the Act:  Deductions and Exclusions\n\n          Turning to an analysis of the structure of the Act,\n\nwe consider  whether reading the  energy assistance exclusion\n\nin  context renders counter-intuitive or ambiguous Congress's\n\nintent on the meaning of \"energy assistance.\"  \n\n          The Secretary argues that the structure of the Food\n\nStamp  Act  indicates  that utility  reimbursements  are  not\n\n\"energy  assistance.\"  Income  eligibility determinations for\n\nfood stamps resemble income tax calculations,  see Department\n                                                             \n\nof Health  &amp; Welfare v.  Block, 784 F.2d  895, 900 (9th  Cir.\n                              \n\n1986);  that is, net  food stamp income  equals gross income,\n\nminus any  payments that are  excluded by statute,  minus the\n\nstandard deduction and any other deductions applicable to the\n\nhousehold.   The  Food Stamp  Act's \"standard  deduction\" and\n\n\"excess shelter cost  deduction\" account  for utility  costs.\n\nSee  7  U.S.C.     2014(e).    According  to  the  Secretary,\n   \n\nexcluding utility reimbursements as \"energy assistance\" would\n\nsubtract utility costs twice:  once as an exclusion and again\n\nas a deduction.\n\n          The  argument that  a payment  may not  be excluded\n\nbecause  it  offsets a  cost  already  accounted for  by  the\n\nstandard  deduction  is  not  persuasive.    All  households,\n\nregardless of  size,  receive the  standard deduction,  which\n\nonly in the most general sense reflects energy utility costs,\n\njust as it reflects many other costs.  The standard deduction\n\n                             -13-\n\nis a fixed  sum that  is adjusted annually  according to  the\n\nConsumer Price  Index  \"for items  other  than food  and  the\n\nhomeowners'  costs and  maintenance  and repair  component of\n\nshelter costs.\"  7 U.S.C.   2014(e).  \n\n          The deduction for excess shelter costs specifically\n\naccounts for  energy utilities, but  it does not  capture the\n\nentire cost  of  energy  utilities.   The  statute  allows  a\n\nhousehold  to  deduct shelter  expenses,  including  rent and\n\nutilities,  only  \"to  the  extent that  the  monthly  amount\n\nexpended by [the] household  for shelter\" exceeds 50%  of the\n\nhousehold's income  after  all  other  deductions  have  been\n\ntaken.    Id.   Deductible  expenses  include rent,  property\n             \n\ntaxes,   property  insurance,   and  mortgage   payments  and\n\ninterest,  as well  as  fuel,  electricity, water,  sewerage,\n\ntrash  collection, and  telephone  service.   See 7  C.F.R.  \n                                                 \n\n273.9(d)(5)(ii).   The cap  on the  deduction is adjusted  to\n\nreflect changes in the Consumer Price Index  for the shelter,\n\nfuel,  and utilities components of housing costs.  7 U.S.C.  \n\n2014(e).  \n\n          According to the Secretary, Congress could not have\n\nintended  to   exclude  the   energy  component   of  utility\n\nreimbursements,  given  the existence  of the  excess shelter\n\ncost  deduction.    But  the  Secretary  does  not  offer  an\n\nalternative construction of the Act that absolutely precludes\n\ndeducting  energy  utility costs  whenever  energy assistance\n\n                             -14-\n\npayments  are  excluded  from income.    Even  if the  energy\n\nassistance exclusion  were  intended to  cover only  payments\n\noffsetting  rising  energy  costs,  as  USDA  contends,   any\n\npayments  designed to  offset  rising energy  costs would  be\n\nexcluded,  while  the  energy   costs  themselves  would   be\n\ndeductible.    Implicit in  any  construction  of the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion  is   that  Congress  intended   energy\n\nassistance to  be  excluded and  energy utility  costs to  be\n\ndeducted,  to the extent that all shelter costs exceed 50% of\n\nmonthly income.  This is borne out in the legislative history\n\nof the energy assistance exclusion:  \"If a household receives\n\nan  energy allowance or grant, that allowance or grant is not\n\nto be included in income  at all, but the energy  costs which\n\nit  covers  may  continue  to be  treated  as  a  potentially\n\ndeductible shelter  expense when billed  or due.\"   H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 788, supra, at 123, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 956.\n              \n\n          As  a practical matter,  there is unlikely  to be a\n\nsubstantial overlap  between households excluding  the energy\n\ncomponent  of  utility  reimbursements  and  those  deducting\n\nexcess   shelter   costs.      Tenants    receiving   utility\n\nreimbursements pay no rent and incur no homeowners' expenses.\n\nThey are  entitled to the excess shelter  cost deduction only\n\nto the extent that  their utility costs alone exceed  half of\n                                             \n\ntheir monthly  income, including the  nonenergy component  of\n\n                             -15-\n\ntheir utility  reimbursements.3  In other  words, the poorest\n\nfood stamp recipients living  in public housing would exclude\n\nthe energy  component of their  utility reimbursements,  then\n\ndeduct the fraction of their utility bills exceeding half  of\n\ntheir  income.   This  result is  consistent  with the  Act's\n\npurpose to  alleviate hunger  and malnutrition  by augmenting\n\nthe  food  purchasing   power  of  participating   low-income\n\nhouseholds.   See 7 U.S.C.    2011.  We do not  find that the\n                 \n\nstructure of  the Food  Stamp Act  requires  that the  energy\n\nassistance  provision  be  construed  contrary  to  its plain\n\nlanguage.  Our reading of the provision in context reinforces\n\nour   determination  that   the   plain  language   manifests\n\nCongress's intent.  \n\n                   C.  Legislative History\n\n                    \n\n3For  administrative convenience  in  calculating the  excess\nshelter expense  deduction,  a \"standard  utility  allowance\"\n(SUA) may be  used in  lieu of a  household's actual  utility\ncosts.  7 C.F.R.   273.9(d)(6).  Households receiving \"energy\nassistance\"  may use  the  SUA only  if  they incur  \"out-of-\npocket\" heating or  cooling expenses.   7  U.S.C.    2014(e).\nThe Third  Circuit, having previously found impermissible the\nUSDA policy of counting utility reimbursements as income, see\n                                                             \nWest, 879  F.2d at  1132, subsequently  upheld a USDA  policy\n    \npreventing  recipients of  utility reimbursements  from using\nthe  SUA unless  their  actual utility  costs exceeded  their\npublic housing utility allowances,  see West v. Sullivan, 973\n                                                        \nF.2d  179 (3d  Cir.  1992), cert.  denied,  113 S.  Ct.  2934\n                                         \n(1993).  Plaintiffs argue that they  may use the SUA, even if\ntheir utility reimbursements  are energy assistance,  because\nthey must  pay 30% of household income  for utilities.  We do\nnot  address this argument because it is not an issue in this\ncase.  \n\n                             -16-\n\n          We  next  consider the  legislative history  of the\n\nenergy   assistance  exclusion,  to   determine  whether  the\n\nlegislative intent we find clearly expressed in the statutory\n\nlanguage  is clouded  or  contradicted by  any statements  of\n\nmembers  of Congress.4   When  the exclusion  was enacted  in\n\n1980,  the House  Committee  on Agriculture  issued a  report\n\nnoting that certain energy grants and allowances, designed to\n\noffset the rising cost of energy, had been excluded from food\n\nstamp   income  calculations  in   prior  years   by  express\n\nprovisions in other statutes.   H.R. Rep. No. 788,  supra, at\n                                                         \n\n122,  1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 955.  The report cites examples of\n\nenergy assistance  programs that were designed  to offset the\n\nrise in  energy costs in the  late 1970s and in  1980, id. at\n                                                          \n\n121-22,  1980  U.S.C.C.A.N. at  954-55,  and  notes that  the\n\nexclusions  for  assistance  provided  under  these  programs\n\nensured that  food stamp recipients would  be held \"harmless\"\n\nfor their benefits.  Id. at 122, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 955.  \n                        \n\n          Preferring that amendments to the Food Stamp Act be\n\nmade  under  its  aegis,  the committee  drafted  the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion, which \"incorporate[s]  the essence\" of\n\nthese prior exclusions.   Id.  The committee stated  that the\n                             \n\n                    \n\n4We reject the parties' invitation to delve into the language\nand  legislative  history   of  the  Housing  and   Community\nDevelopment Reauthorization Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-550,\n   927,  106  Stat.  3672,  3885-86  (1992).    That  statute\naddresses  neither  how   utility  reimbursements  should  be\ntreated   under  the   Food   Stamp  Act,   nor  the   proper\ninterpretation of the energy assistance exclusion.  \n\n                             -17-\n\nprovision  would  exclude  \"all  energy  assistance  provided\n\nhouseholds  through the use of Federal, State, or local funds\n\nflowing from .  . . laws that focus on  the problem of energy\n\nassistance.\"   Id.  at 123,  1980 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 956.   The\n                  \n\ncommittee further  stated that  the provision would  \"exclude\n\nfrom income  any direct payments  made to  households by  the\n\nFederal Government\" under  \"crisis intervention\" or  \"regular\n\nenergy  assistance\"  programs.

(emphasis added).\n   \n\n          The   Secretary   argues   that   the   highlighted\n\nstatements support a narrow definition of \"energy assistance\"\n\nfor the purpose of  section 2014(d)(11)(A).  Our  scrutiny of\n\nthe context, however, leads us to conclude that these remarks\n\nwere prompted by the concern that state and local governments\n\nmight  pass  off  increases  in  existing,  nonenergy-related\n\nwelfare  program  payments  as   \"energy  assistance.\"    See\n                                                             \n\nMaryland Dep't of Human  Res., 976 F.2d at 1470-71.   Because\n                             \n\nthe federal  government pays  the entire  cost of food  stamp\n\nbenefits,  7 U.S.C.   2013(a), such a ploy would increase the\n\nallotments  of  food  stamps to  a  state's  residents  at no\n\nsubstantial  cost  to the  state.   To  thwart  such efforts,\n\nCongress  subsequently  amended  the  exclusion   for  energy\n\nassistance  payments provided  under state  and local  laws.5\n\n                    \n\n5Section 2014(d)(11)(B) excludes from food stamp income,\n          any payments  or allowances made  for the\n          purpose of providing energy  assistance .\n          .  .  under  any  State  or   local  laws\n          designated   by   the   State  or   local\n          legislative    body   authorizing    such\n          payments   or    allowances   as   energy\n\n                             -19-\n\nSee Maryland Dep't of Human Res., 976 F.2d at  1471.  Utility\n                                \n\nreimbursements,  in  contrast,  are  provided  under  federal\n\nregulations that specify that the payments account for energy\n\nand nonenergy utility costs.  Although we do not dispute that\n\nthe  committee  intended  that  \"energy  assistance\"  include\n\nbenefits   offsetting  the   rising  cost   of  energy,   the\n\nlegislative  history of  the provision  reveals no  intent to\n\ncircumscribe the plain language of  the provision so that  it\n\nwould apply only to such benefits.  \n\n          Furthermore,   we   note   that   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation  of the  energy assistance exclusion  causes a\n\nresult  at odds with the legislative history.  The 1980 House\n\nReport  indicates that  typical  energy  assistance  programs\n\n\"hold low-income  households harmless  by permitting  them to\n\nbuy the same  amount of  energy they would  have utilized  in\n\npast years without having  to diminish their already marginal\n\n                    \n\n          assistance,   and   determined   by   the\n          Secretary to be calculated as if provided\n          by the State or local government involved\n          on  a seasonal  basis  for  an  aggregate\n          period not  to exceed  six months in  any\n          year even if such payments  or allowances\n          (including tax credits) are  not provided\n          on a  seasonal basis because  it would be\n          administratively       infeasible      or\n          impracticable to do so.\n\nUnlike  the  exclusion  for federal  energy  assistance, this\nstatute  expressly   provides   the  Secretary   a  role   in\ndetermining  whether payments  designated by  state or  local\ngovernments  as  \"energy  assistance\"  should  be  counted as\nincome.\n\n                             -20-\n\nincomes.\"    H.R.   Rep.  No.  788,   supra,  at  122,   1980\n                                           \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N.  at  955.   An  exclusion  for such  assistance,\n\naccording  to the  House  Report, guarantees  that low-income\n\nhouseholds are held harmless for the assistance they receive.\n\nId.    Utility  reimbursements  with  energy  components  are\n   \n\ndesigned  in part to ensure that tenants, on average, will be\n\nable to purchase energy  utilities without spending more than\n\n30%  of household  income.   The allowances  underlying these\n\nreimbursements are  adjusted annually to  reflect substantial\n\nenergy  cost increases.  See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt.\n                                  \n\nC,  exh.  E.IX.C; 24  C.F.R.     882.214,  965.478.   In this\n\nmanner,  utility  reimbursements  ensure that  a  household's\n\nexpenditures for  energy remain  constant as a  percentage of\n\nhousehold  income, from  year to  year.   USDA's practice  of\n\ncounting the energy  component of  utility reimbursements  as\n\nincome does  not hold  tenants \"harmless\" for  the assistance\n\nthey receive.    \n\n          The Secretary argues  that Congress ratified USDA's\n\ninterpretation  of the  statute  when it  amended the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion  in  1988.    Prior  to  1988,  section\n\n2014(d)(11)(A)   exempted  from   income  \"any   payments  or\n\nallowances made  under any  Federal  law for  the purpose  of\n\nproviding energy assistance.\"  See West v. Bowen, 879 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1130.   Congress  reworded the  statute in  1988 so  that the\n\nprovision  currently excludes \"any payments or allowances for\n\n                             -21-\n\nthe purpose of providing  energy assistance under any Federal\n\nlaw.\"    A  Senate   committee  report  indicates  that  this\n\n\"technical amendment\" clarified\n\n          that  USDA and local agencies do not need\n          to conduct an inquiry into the purpose of\n          a   federal   statute  before   excluding\n          federal  \"payments  for  the  purpose  of\n          energy  assistance.\"    The  law  as  now\n          written could  be  read to  require  this\n          analysis.\n\n          The  crucial  question should  be whether\n          the  purpose of  the  payment  is  energy\n          assistance, not whether the statute, as a\n          whole, is primarily for energy assistance\n          or includes other human services as well.\n          This  change is  not  intended to  change\n                                                   \n          current policy.\n                         \n\nS.

Although  USDA treated\n\nutility  reimbursements  as income  before  1988,  the agency\n\nbased  this  practice on  the  faulty  interpretation of  the\n\nenergy  assistance  exclusion  that  the  1988  amendment was\n\ndesigned to correct.

June 22, 1983),\n     \n\nheld, consistent  with USDA's  interpretation  at that  time,\n\nthat  utility  reimbursements  are  not  \"energy  assistance\"\n\nbecause they were authorized  by federal housing laws, rather\n                                                \n\nthan energy assistance laws.6  \n                      \n\n          Viewed    in    this    light,   the    plaintiffs'\n\ninterpretation of the 1988 amendment and the Senate Report is\n\nmore persuasive:   the amendment was  not intended to  change\n\ncongressional   policy,  but  in  effect  it  repudiated  the\n             \n\nagency's litigation  position by clarifying that any payments\n                                                    \n\nfor energy assistance be  excluded, regardless of the purpose\n\nof the  law authorizing  the payments.   Further  support for\n\nthis  interpretation  is  that  the committee  described  the\n\nrewording of  the statute  as a  \"technical amendment.\"   The\n\nstatement in  the legislative history that  the amendment \"is\n\nnot intended to change  current policy\" reaffirms that it  is\n\nnot a substantive revision of the statutory language.\n\n          The   Secretary's  final  argument   based  on  the\n\nlegislative history is that Congress expressed tacit approval\n\nof  USDA's  interpretation by  leaving  it in  place  when it\n\n                    \n\n6The district court in Mitchell cited the legislative history\n                               \nof the energy assistance exclusion as an alternate  basis for\nupholding the practice of counting utility reimbursements  as\nincome.  See Mitchell, No. 82-3297-3, slip op. at 13-28.  \n                     \n\n                             -23-\n\namended  the   statute  in   1988.    Inaction   may  signify\n\nacquiescence  to an  agency interpretation.   See,  e.g., Bob\n                                                             \n\nJones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600-01 (1983).  A\n                            \n\nlogical  prerequisite to  inferring approval  or ratification\n\nfrom silence  is that  the agency's interpretation  antedates\n\nany relevant amendments.  That is not so here.  Although USDA\n\nhas  invariably deemed  utility reimbursements  to be  income\n\nunder  the Food Stamp  Act, the  agency's rationale  for this\n\npractice  has changed over time.  Prior to the 1988 amendment\n\nof  the  Act,  the agency  asserted  in  litigation that  the\n\nexclusion applied  only to  payments made under  federal laws\n\nspecifically enacted to provide  energy assistance.  The 1988\n\namendment condemned  this interpretation, see West  v. Bowen,\n                                                            \n\n879 F.2d at 1322, and the agency abandoned it in favor of the\n\nposition it  espouses in this case,  that \"energy assistance\"\n\nrefers only  to  payments offsetting  rapidly  rising  energy\n\ncosts.   The interpretation of the statute at issue on appeal\n\nthus does not predate the 1988 amendment.  \n\n          We  have considered  USDA's unvarying  treatment of\n                                                          \n\nutility reimbursements as an  \"interpretation\" of the statute\n\ncapable  of ratification by silence, but we do not find great\n\nsignificance in Congress's inaction.  \"Congressional inaction\n\nfrequently    betokens    unawareness,   preoccupation,    or\n\nparalysis.\"   Zuber  v.  Allen,  396 U.S.  168,  185-86  n.21\n                              \n\n(1969).   Legislative  silence is  most significant  when the\n\n                             -24-\n\n\"area is one  of traditional  year-by-year supervision,  like\n\ntax,  where watchdog committees  are considering and revising\n\nthe statutory scheme.\"  Id.   In the baker's dozen years that\n                           \n\nhave  passed  since  the  Food Stamp  Act  energy  assistance\n\nexclusion was enacted,  the Act has been  amended many times,\n\nbut  the exclusion itself has  been amended only  twice.  The\n\n1981 amendment  affected only  the provision  excluding state\n\nand  local  energy  assistance  payments.    The  legislative\n\nhistory of  the 1988 amendment reflects  a senate committee's\n\nappreciation  that USDA  misread  the statute,  but does  not\n\nindicate the  committee's awareness  of  USDA's treatment  of\n\nutility reimbursements.  See  S. Rep. No. 397, supra,  at 28,\n                                                    \n\n1988  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 2266  (stating  that  \"USDA and  local\n\nagencies do not need  to conduct an inquiry into  the purpose\n\nof a federal  statute before  excluding\" energy  assistance).\n\nTherefore, even if what the senate committee recognized about\n\nthe   agency's  prior   misreading   of  the   statute   were\n\nattributable  to the  entire Congress,  this would  not prove\n\ncongressional   cognizance  of   the  treatment   of  utility\n\nreimbursements. \n\n          There are still fewer facts outside the legislative\n\nhistory supporting an  inference of congressional  awareness.\n\nUSDA  has  not embodied  its  interpretation  of the  federal\n\nenergy assistance  exclusion in a regulation.   Moreover, our\n\nresearch  uncovered  nothing   suggesting  that  the   agency\n\n                             -25-\n\nembodied its position on utility reimbursements in any agency\n\npublication prior  to 1990, when it  issued policy statements\n\non  the  matter.   And  the  only courts  considering  USDA's\n\ntreatment  of  utility reimbursements  prior  to 1988  issued\n\nunpublished opinions.  E.g., West, No. 84-3883; Mitchell, No.\n                                                        \n\n82-3297-3.   Furthermore,  the  policy  of including  utility\n\nreimbursements in  food stamp  income affects only  very poor\n\nFmHA and HUD tenants, persons unlikely to  have the resources\n\nto  publicize  their  plight.    We  cannot  infer  from  the\n\nlegislative history  and from these  facts that congressional\n\nsilence  signals ratification of the agency's policy.  Nor do\n\nwe find in the legislative history any statements belying our\n\ndetermination that Congress's intended meaning for the energy\n\nassistance exclusion is manifested by its plain language.\n\n                        D.  Deference\n\n          The  Secretary argues  that  we must  defer to  the\n\nagency's  judgment   on  the  applicability   of  the  energy\n\nassistance exclusion  to utility reimbursements  because this\n\nauthority  has   been  expressly  delegated  to  the  agency.\n\nAccording  to the  Secretary, Congress  explicitly called  on\n\nUSDA to determine whether any payments provided under federal\n\n\"laws not specifically  dealing with energy assistance\"  were\n\n\"energy-assistance related.\"   H.R.

An  agency's  reasonable\n\nconstruction  of  a statute  is  entitled  to deference  when\n\n                             -26-\n\nCongress delegates to the  agency the power to  interpret the\n\nstatute.  See St. Luke's Hosp. v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human\n                                                             \n\nServs., 810 F.2d 325, 331 (1st Cir. 1987).\n      \n\n          We previously  quoted the  passage  from the  House\n\nReport cited  by the Secretary  in support of  this argument,\n\nsee  H.R. Rep. No. 788,  supra, at 123,  1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n                              \n\n956, and we  noted that the remarks reflected the committee's\n\nconcern  that  state  or  local governments  might  pass  off\n\nincreases in  general welfare as energy  assistance.  Utility\n\nreimbursements,   in  contrast,  are  authorized  by  federal\n\nregulations specifying that  the payments account  for energy\n\nutility  costs.    The   legislative  history  cited  by  the\n\nSecretary  does  not  empower   USDA  to  refine  the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion so that it does not apply to the energy\n\ncomponent of a utility reimbursement.    Finally,         the\n\nSecretary  contends  that  USDA's  policy  should  be  upheld\n\nbecause,  under Chevron,  courts  must defer  to an  agency's\n                       \n\nreasonable  interpretation  of   a  statute  it  administers.\n\nChevron prescribes that courts  employ a two-step analysis of\n       \n\nan  agency's interpretation of a statute it administers.  See\n                                                             \n\nDion,  933 F.2d at 14-15.  Deference is appropriate only when\n    \n\nthe legislative intent is unclear.  See St. Luke's Hosp., 810\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 331.  In this case, the plain language of the statute\n\nmanifests Congress's  intent on the  question at issue:   any\n\npayment designed to offset energy costs is excluded from food\n\n                             -27-\n\nstamp  income,  not just  payments offsetting  rapidly rising\n\nenergy costs.  We conclude that the energy component of a HUD\n\nor FmHA utility reimbursement, as  a subsidy for the purchase\n\nof  energy,   must  be   excluded  from  food   stamp  income\n\ncalculations.    Any  policy  of  USDA  to  the  contrary  is\n\nimpermissible.\n\n          The decision of the district court is therefore\n\n          Reversed.    \n          Reversed.\n                   \n\n          Dissent follows.\n\n                             -28-\n\n        CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).   Although  the court\n        CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).\n                           \n\nproposes  a  plausible  alternative,  I  cannot  agree  that  the\n\nExclusion   11  interpretation  adopted   by  the  United  States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture (\"USDA\") is \"arbitrary, capricious,  or\n\nmanifestly  contrary to  the statute.\"   Chevron U.S.A.,  Inc. v.\n                                                            \n\nNational Resource Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984).  Not\n                               \n\nonly  are statutory  interpretations by  an administering  agency\n\nentitled to deferential review, id., but the rationale underlying\n                                 \n\nthe Chevron doctrine is fully implicated  in this case.  I  would\n         \n\ntherefore  accord Chevron deference  to USDA's  interpretation of\n                       \n\nthe pivotal language \"energy assistance [payments],\" as excluding\n\nordinary utility reimbursements (\"URs\").\n\n        First, the omnibus regulatory scheme  established under\n\nthe Food Stamp Act (\"FSA\") is \"technical and complex\" both in its\n\nliteral  statutory  manifestation   and  in  its   interdependent\n\nimplementation with several  elaborate federal  and state  public\n\nassistance statutes administered by other agencies (e.g., HUD and\n                                                      \n\nFmHA).   See id.  at 865;  Maryland Dep't  of Human  Resources v.\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States Dep't  of Agric.,  976 F.2d  1462, 1470  (4th Cir.\n                             \n\n1992).    As a  consequence of  its  accustomed immersion  in the\n\nintricacies of the FSA, and its intimate familiarity with related\n\nstatutory schemes,  the USDA, like other  administering agencies,\n\nordinarily is  presumed to  have the  confidence  of Congress  in\n\naffording interstitial interpretations  of statutes entrusted  to\n\nits  administration.

Further, as a politically\n    \n\naccountable executive agency, generally speaking the USDA  should\n\nbe  left to \"strike the [policy] balance\" not struck by Congress,\n\nand to reach \"a  reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing\n                                                               \n\ninterests.\"  Chevron, 467  U.S. at 865-66 (emphasis added).   The\n                  \n\npolicy  choices plainly  implicated  by the  FSA's provisions  on\n             \n\nincome inclusion and  exclusion, and Congress's repeated  failure\n\nto  countermand USDA's longstanding  policy favoring inclusion of\n\nURs, see Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 12 (1965), present a textbook\n                    \n\ncase  for  Chevron deference.    Lastly, ever  since  1980, after\n                \n\nconsidering  Exclusion  11  and  its legislative  history  \"in  a\n\ndetailed  and reasoned  fashion,\" Chevron,  467 U.S. at  865, the\n                                       \n\nUSDA consistently has concluded  that Congress did not  intend to\n\ninsulate food  stamp recipients  from energy cost  increases that\n\nroutinely accompany  inflationary rises in the  nature of \"normal\n\nhousehold living expenses.\"  7 C.F.R.   273.9(c)(5) (1993).\n\n        I readily acknowledge, of course, that Chevron does not\n                                                      \n\ndictate  judicial deference  to  agency  interpretations  in  all\n\ncircumstances.   See, e.g., Larson, 2 F.3d at 468 (under Chevron,\n                                                              \n\n\"courts have the last word on statutory  interpretation [and] the\n\nquestion  is one  of how  much weight  to be  accorded  to agency\n                                   \n\nviews\") (emphasis added).   In my  view, however, after  charting\n\nthe  course  for  its   two-tiered  Chevron  inquiry,  the  court\n                                         \n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nmisplaces its  compass by withholding deference  on impermissible\n\ngrounds.\n\n        The  overarching  aim of  the  Chevron  analysis is  to\n                                              \n\ndetermine \"whether  Congress has  directly spoken to  the precise\n                                                               \n\nquestion at issue.\"   Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842  (emphasis added);\n                           \n\nsee K  Mart Corp. v.

In the\n                          \n\npresent case,  the court frames  the inquiry less  precisely than\n\nChevron requires.

The  USDA  vigorously\ninsists otherwise, and the district  court prudently bypassed\nthe entire administrative implementation  issue.

On the other hand, this court bases\nits  \"minimal  administrative  burden\" thesis  solely  on  an\nexamination of the cold  appellate record, including the FSA,\nHUD, and  FmHA implementing regulations, without  the benefit\nof a developed record relating to the types of problems which\nmight portend serious administrative burdens.\n   The USDA does  not set,  monitor, or control  HUD or  FmHA\nutility  allowances,  nor  the  annual  adjustments to  those\n                                                   \nallowances.    Thus, even  though  segregation  may appear  a\n\"simple  matter of  arithmetic\"  in the  abstract, it  cannot\nsimply be assumed that segregation would not entail elaborate\ninter-agency  monitoring and policing    for example, between\nthe  USDA and  HUD  to  ensure  that  food  stamp  recipients\ncorrectly declare the appropriate  components of their URs as\nexcludible income.  Absent some contrary evidence, therefore,\nthe  USDA's  assessment of  the  likely  burdens entailed  in\nimplementing such  an  administrative regime  warrants  prima\nfacie deference.\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nthe  FSA's narrowly-drawn  income exclusions,  and the  competing\n\ninterests at stake in any  benefit allocation made by government.\n\nSee  H.R.

While acknowledging that\n                            \n\nfamilies  with the lowest incomes  often feel the financial brunt\n\nof this congressional policy choice, the USDA assiduously acts to\n\nfurther that legislative policy  by treating as includible income\n                                                               \n\nmany  other routine  and  need-based  assistance  payments  which\n                                  \n\nincrease a family's real  purchasing power.

See  supra p.  19.   The court's  statement presumably\n                   \n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\nstems  from two premises: (1) USDA's practice of including URs as\n\nfood stamp \"income\" fails to  hold food stamp families \"harmless\"\n\nby ensuring  that \"a  household's expenditures for  energy remain\n\nconstant as a percentage of household income, from year to year,\"\n\nand  (2)   hypothetical  UR  payments   might  sometimes  contain\n\nreimbursements for  superinflationary energy cost  increases, for\n\nwhich URs  would hold tenants \"harmless.\"  In order to assess the\n\nsoundness of  these  two  premises,  it  is  necessary  first  to\n\ndetermine  what Congress meant when it said that the \"new\" energy\n\nprograms were designed to  hold recipient families \"harmless\" for\n                                                          \n\n\"energy assistance\" payments, LIHEAP being  a known type of \"new\"\n                                                      \n\nenergy assistance payment.\n\n        Congress enacted LIHEAA  intending that \"new\"  programs\n\nof its  type would supplement preexisting governmental assistance\n                           \n\nprograms which had not previously provided benefit adjustments to\n                    \n\nlow income households to account for  energy cost increases which\n\noutpaced  general cost-of-living increases.  See S. Rep. No. 394,\n                                              \n\nsupra, at  111 (expressing concern that  \"the ordinary mechanisms\n                                                               \n\nfor adjusting  income assistance programs to the  rising costs of\n\nliving  may be  inadequate  to meet  the extraordinary  increases\n                                                    \n\nwhich have taken place in energy costs\") (emphasis added).  Thus,\n\nwhen  enacting  LIHEAA,   Congress  ostensibly  determined   that\n\npreexisting  statutory  mechanisms  for  making  adjustments  for\n\n\"substantial  [energy   rate]  increases,\"  like   those  already\n\nincorporated in the FSA, HUD and FmHA programs, were ill-designed\n\nto offset  recent and  unprecedented \"spike\" increases  in energy\n\n                             -38-\n                              38\n\ncosts, and opted to  reimburse food stamp recipients in  full for\n                                                           \n\nall otherwise unreimbursed expenditures for these past and future\n\n\"spike\" increases.

In  these respects, therefore,  LIHEAA worked a\n\ncomplete \"wash.\"\n      \n\n        On the other hand,  consider the following hypothetical\n\ncalculations  of representative  housing assistance  payments and\n\nURs:  \n                                      1990      1991\n                                                    \n\n             approved rent            $300      $300\n           + utility allowance        $ 60      $ 72\n                                                    \n           = approved shelter cost    $360      $372\n           - 30% family income        $ 45      $ 45\n               of $150\n                                                    \n             housing assistance       $315      $327\n               payment\n           - approved rent            $300      $300\n                                                    \n             utility reimbursement    $ 15      $ 27\n\n                             -39-\n                              39\n\nThe  utility allowance,  which  may  or  may not  reflect  actual\n                                                               \n\nutility costs, is an average  figure calculated by the \"landlord\"\n\nfor  all units in  a covered facility, and  is designed to afford\n\ntenants  an \"adequate\" allowance  for household  utilities, while\n\ndeterring  inefficient energy usage.   As  the court  points out,\n\n\"substantial\" annual  increases in energy rates  (e.g., more than\n                                                    \n\n10%) might require the \"landlord\" to make corresponding increases\n\nin the pre-set utility allowance.   See 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt.\n                                     \n\nC, exh. E.IX.C; 24 C.F.R.    882.214, 965.478.  So, in  our hypo-\n\ntheticals, if utility rates increased to $72 over one year, a 20%\n\nincrease, the tenant's UR would increase from $15 to $27.  If the\n\ngeneral or across-the-board inflation rate for the same year were\n\nonly 15%, then one-quarter of the $12 increase in the  UR paid to\n\nthe tenant, or $3, could  be considered an additional  reimburse-\n               \n\nment for  utility cost increases beyond  the general inflationary\n\nrate,  and some lesser portion  of that segregable  payment of $3\n\nwould be  for superinflationary  energy (as opposed  to nonenergy\n                                     \n\nutility) price  increases.  Accordingly, our  hypothetical $27 UR\n\nwould include three components:  basic energy cost ($15), general\n\ninflationary increase ($9), and superinflationary increase ($3).\n\n        When  the  identical   \"hold  harmless\"  analysis  just\n\napplied  to  LIHEAP  is  applied  to  the  housing  URs  Congress\n\nestablished prior to  its enactment  of LIHEAA, the  flaw in  the\n\nthesis  advanced by  the  court becomes  clear.8   Unlike  LIHEAP\n\n                    \n\n8The court  concludes that  \"USDA's practice of  counting the\nenergy component  of [URs]  as income does  not hold  tenants\n'harmless'  for the assistance they  receive.\"  See supra pp.\n                                                         \n\n                             -40-\n                              40\n\npayments, URs simply  are not  payments made pursuant  to a  \"new\n                           \n\nprogram\" as  specifically referred  to in  House Report  No. 788.\n\n[See  supra  p.  9.]    For  example,  HUD's  section  8  housing\n         \n\nlegislation was enacted in  1974, see P.L. No. 93-383,    201(a),\n                                   \n\n88 Stat. 653  (1974) (codified at 42 U.S.C.    1437), well before\n\nCongress  can   reasonably  be  thought  to   have  foreseen  the\n\nsuperinflationary energy  price increases experienced in the late\n\n1970s.   When  URs  were first  established, therefore,  Congress\n                            \n\ncould not  have contemplated, let  alone intended, that  the UR's\n\n\"basic cost\" component ($15) or its \"general inflation\" component\n\n($9) would hold recipient families  \"harmless\" in the two special\n                                                       \n\nsenses  in which LIHEAA later benefited its recipients.  Prior to\n\ntheir initial entitlement to  URs, low income families presumably\n\npaid the full $60 utility  cost from income; whereas  immediately\n\nafter  the establishment of URs, it cost the same family only $45\n\nto purchase  the same amount of  energy it had purchased  for $60\n                          \n\nthe  previous  year.    Congress  established  the  \"basic  cost\"\n\ncomponent in utility allowances and  URs to reduce the percentage\n                                                \n\nof household  income that must be expended  for energy regardless\n                                                               \n\nof  past inflationary  trends.   Thus  coupled  with an  adequate\n\ninternal  mechanism  for  making future  adjustments  for general\n\ninflationary  increases, the  UR worked  a real  $15  increase in\n                                                            \n\noverall purchasing power, not merely a \"wash.\"\n\n                    \n\n20-21.  Regardless whether this is the right answer, however,\nthe  court has not posed the right question.  The appropriate\ninquiry  is whether these HUD and  FmHA housing programs were\n                                               \nintended to hold families harmless in the same way LIHEAA was\nmeant to do.\n\n                             -41-\n                              41\n\n        At  most,  therefore,  the court  has  demonstrated  in\n\ntheory that the USDA might be required at some time in the future\n\nto exclude a relatively small portion of some URs from food stamp\n\n\"income\";  viz.,  the $3  (or less)  of  the hypothetical  $27 UR\n             \n\nattributable  to any  \"superinflationary  component.\"   But  this\n\ntheory inevitablyimports seriousconceptual impediments ofits own.\n\n        First, in  defense of this theory  the court disregards\n                                                               \n\nthe  unitary nature  of UR  payments, opining  that the  USDA can\n          \n\neasily segregate URs into  their energy and nonenergy components,\n\nthereby  smoothing  the path  for  its conclusion  that  the UR's\n\nenergy  component  alone  qualifies  for  \"exclusion\"   from  FSA\n\n\"income.\"  See supra pp. 10-11;  but cf. supra pp. 31-32.  Having\n                                            \n\nthus disregarded  the unitary  nature of  UR payments, the  court\n\ncannot  then  credibly  suggest  that the  USDA  would  be acting\n\narbitrarily by segregating and  excluding from FSA income a  UR's\n                                                       \n\nhypothetical superinflationary  component ($3) while at  the same\n\ntime  including   the  UR's  \"basic  cost\"   ($15)  and  \"general\n\ninflation\"  ($9) components  in  FSA income.    Second, and  more\n\nimportantly,  no  part  of any  UR  will  include  such a  super-\n\ninflationary component during periods of subinflationary, stable,\n\nor  declining energy prices.   Indeed, the USDA  concedes that it\n\nmay be appropriate to exclude from FSA income a UR which actually\n                                                               \n\nrepresents   a   reimbursement   for   superinflationary   energy\n\nincreases.  Given general  economic trends in the late  1980s and\n\nearly 1990s,  however, appellants advisedly have  not argued that\n\ntheir  own   URs  covered  any   superinflationary  energy  price\n\n                             -42-\n                              42\n\nincreases, nor do they suggest that USDA has attempted to include\n\nany  such superinflationary  component  in any  other food  stamp\n\nrecipient's \"income.\"  Rather, the USDA continues to  include HUD\n\nand FmHA  URs in food  stamp \"income\" on  the theory that  unless\n\nproven to  contain some superinflationary  component, current HUD\n\nand FmHA URs presumably reimburse only \"routine\" energy costs and\n\nsubinflationary  increases in  energy  costs.   The current  USDA\n             \n\nregulations flexibly  track this presumption by  reference to the\n\nincludibility of all reimbursements  for \"normal household living\n\nexpenses.\"    As a consequence, I  find no support for the thesis\n\nthat the USDA's policy  choice is \"at odds\" with  the legislative\n\nhistory.\n\n        State \"Energy Assistance\" Payments\n                                          \n\n        As its  second rejoinder, the court  takes the position\n\nthat the language  quoted from House Report No. 788, see supra at\n                                                            \n\npp.  17-18, considered  in  context, can  lead to  one reasonable\n\nconclusion only    that  Congress was particularly concerned that\n\n\"state  and  local  governments   might  pass  off  increases  in\n\nexisting, nonenergy-related  welfare program payments  as 'energy\n\nassistance'\" so as to  shift local welfare burdens  to federally-\n\nfunded  programs (e.g., the  FSA program).   Once again, however,\n                    \n\nthis thesis does not withstand close scrutiny, let alone begin to\n\ndispel the  plausibility of the alternative view  advanced by the\n\nUSDA.\n\n        If  this sort  of  burden shifting  had  indeed been  a\n\nmatter  of significant legislative concern,  it would have been a\n\n                             -43-\n                              43\n\nsimple matter for  Congress to authorize  a FSA income  exclusion\n\nfor  all  bona fide  energy cost  assistance  paid to  food stamp\n                 \n\nrecipients  by the States.   All  Congress need  have done  is to\n\nrequire States  to satisfy  the Secretary  that any increases  in\n\nstate-paid benefits  were for food stamp  recipients' energy cost\n\nincreases,  rather  than  their  nonenergy cost  increases.    In\n\naddition to its threshold  requirement that energy cost increases\n\nbe   the  \"but-for   cause\"  of   any   increase  in   a  state's\n\nreimbursements,  however, Congress  imposed a  second, subsidiary\n\ncondition:      even   a   state's   bona   fide   energy-related\n                                              \n\nreimbursements should be  exempt under Exclusion 11  \"only to the\n                                                               \n\nextent  that  the  [benefit]  increase is  attributable  to  high\n                                                               \n\nheating costs rather than  general inflationary conditions.\"  The\n                                                        \n\ncourt has not explained  how Congress could have meant  to thwart\n\nimproper diversions of State welfare program costs by prohibiting\n\nFSA income  exclusions for bona fide  subinflationary energy cost\n                                  \n\nreimbursements by  a  State, if  federal  payments for  the  same\n\npurposes  were readily  excludible from  food stamp  income.   In\n\nsharp   contrast, the reading given  House Report No. 788  by the\n\nUSDA  dovetails neatly  with the  stated goals  of \"new\"  federal\n\nprograms,  such   as  LIHEAA,  which  Congress   referred  to  as\n\nprototypes  of  federal   \"intervention\"  payments  for   \"energy\n\nassistance.\"\n\n        In   conclusion,   the    USDA's   interpretation    is\n\ncorroborated  both  by a  reasonable  reading  of Exclusion  11's\n\nambiguous  language and  its legislative  history.   There  is no\n\n                             -44-\n                              44\n\nstatutory  or  historical  evidence whatever  that  Congress  has\n\nevinced a \"specific intention\" to include HUD and FmHA URs within\n\nthe Exclusion 11 language:  \"payment[s] . . . for  energy assist-\n\nance.\"   Congress has never once  alluded to HUD and  FmHA URs as\n\n\"energy  assistance [payments],\"  even  though URs  preceded  the\n\nenactment of Exclusion 11 by some six years.  See, e.g., P.L. No.\n                                                     \n\n93-383,    201(a), 88 Stat. 653 (1974).  Chevron deference is not\n                                              \n\ndependent on  a determination  \"that the agency  construction was\n\nthe  only [permissible] one . . . , or even the reading the court\n       \n\nwould  have reached  if the  question initially  had arisen  in a\n\njudicial setting.\"  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11.\n                         \n\n        Notwithstanding its able effort to dispel the  permeant\n\nambiguity  in  the relevant  legislative  history, and  interpret\n\nExclusion 11 apart from its unique historical  context, the court\n\nhas  disclosed no  suggestion  that Congress  ever intimated  its\n\ndisapproval of  the USDA's  longstanding policy  against treating\n\nroutine utility reimbursements as \"energy assistance [payments].\"\n\nAlthough  I recognize  that \"[c]ongressional  inaction frequently\n                                                    \n\nbetokens  unawareness, preoccupation,  or paralysis,\"  Zuber, 396\n                                                          \n\nU.S. at 185-86 n.21,  Congress has amended Exclusion 11  not once\n\nbut twice since the USDA adopted its present policy on URs.

In  relevant respects, these\n\nregulations are identical.   Tenants in HUD  and FmHA housing\n\npay no more  than 30% of  household income for  rent plus  an\n\nallowance  for any  utilities not  supplied by  the landlord.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C.    1437a(a)(1);  7 C.F.R. pt.  1930, subpt.  C,\n   \n\nexhs. B.IV.A.2.c, E.II.E.  Water, sewerage, trash collection,\n\nelectricity, cooking fuel, heat,  and hot water are utilities\n\nfor  which allowances may be  established.  See  24 C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n813.102, 965.472, 965.476; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt. E, exhs.\n\nA-5, A-6.   The FmHA utility  allowance reflects the  utility\n\ncosts incurred by the majority of households in similar units\n\nin a housing complex.  See  7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt. E, exh.\n                          \n\nA-6.I, -6.II.  HUD utility allowances represent a \"reasonable\n\n                             -4-\n\nconsumption\"   of   utilities   \"by  an   energy-conservative\n\nhousehold   of  modest  circumstances   consistent  with  the\n\nrequirements  of  a  safe,  sanitary  and  healthful   living\n\nenvironment.\"  24 C.F.R.    813.102, 965.476(a).       \n\n          To prevent tenants who  pay for their own utilities\n\nfrom  generally incurring  excessive utility  costs, HUD  and\n\nFmHA  regulations permit rent (capped at 30% of income) to be\n\noffset  by  an allowance  for utilities.    See 24  C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n813.102, 913.102; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt. C, exh. E.IX.A.1.\n\nThis  set  off  results  in  a   payment  called  a  \"utility\n\nreimbursement\"  whenever  monthly  income  is  very  low  and\n\nutility costs  are relatively high.   A utility reimbursement\n\nis equal to the sum  of all allowances for any  utilities not\n\nsupplied by the landlord minus 30% of monthly income.  See 24\n                                                          \n\nC.F.R.    813.102, 913.102; 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt. C, exh.\n\nE.IX.A.2. \n\n          For example, if a  tenant's monthly income is $100,\n\n$30 (30%) is the total amount the tenant must pay for housing\n\ncosts,  including  any utility  allowance.    If the  utility\n\nallowance  is  $5, the  tenant  will  not  receive a  utility\n\nreimbursement, but will owe the landlord only $25 because the\n\nallowance is credited against the total amount due.  A tenant\n\nwith the same monthly income, but with a utility allowance of\n\n$50, will pay the landlord no rent and will receive a utility\n\nreimbursement  of $20  (the  utility allowance  minus 30%  of\n\n                             -5-\n\n$100).   Every  tenant  entitled to  a utility  reimbursement\n\nreceives  a  bill from  at least  one  utility company.   The\n\nreimbursement ensures  that FmHA  and HUD tenants,  living in\n\nvery poor households, will not generally pay more than 30% of\n\nhousehold  income for  energy,  water,  sewerage,  and  trash\n\ncollection costs.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs  argue  that utility  reimbursements are\n\n\"energy assistance,\"  and that section  2014(d)(11)(A) of the\n\nFood  Stamp   Act  exempts   such   assistance  from   income\n\ncalculations.  USDA contends  that this provision,  excluding\n\nfrom  food  stamp income  \"any  payments for  the  purpose of\n\nproviding energy assistance,\" is inapplicable because \"energy\n\nassistance\"  is limited  to payments  made to  offset rapidly\n\nrising  energy  costs, whereas  utility  reimbursements cover\n\nroutine utility costs.2\n\n                    \n\n2Courts  have  split  over  whether USDA  may  count  utility\nreimbursements as income.

To   be  excluded   from  income   under  section\n\n2014(d)(11)(A), a payment must be  \"for the purpose of energy\n\nassistance.\"   The  Act  provides no  definition for  \"energy\n\nassistance,\"  but its  meaning  is generally  understood.   A\n\npayment  that  provides  \"assistance\" commonly  refers  to  a\n\npublic  subsidy; for  example:    housing assistance,  rental\n\nassistance,  and  medical  assistance  payments.   We  assume\n\n\"`that the  legislative purpose is expressed  by the ordinary\n\nmeaning  of the words used.'\"  American Tobacco Co., 456 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat  68 (citation omitted).  In the absence of a manifestation\n\nof  legislative  intent to  the  contrary,  we conclude  that\n\n\"energy assistance\" means what it says:  a public subsidy for\n\nthe purchase of energy.  \n\n          Under  this  plain reading  of  the  provision, the\n\nplaintiffs  have  no  colorable  claim  unless their  utility\n\nreimbursements  are  subsidies  for  energy.   FmHA  and  HUD\n\nutility  allowances account  for nonenergy utilities  such as\n\nwater,  sewerage, and  trash  collection, as  well as  energy\n\nutilities including  heat, electricity, natural gas,  and hot\n\nwater.    A  tenant  directly liable  for  certain  utilities\n\nreceives  a  utility reimbursement  only  if the  sum  of the\n\nallowances  for  these  utilities  exceeds  30% of  household\n\nincome.     Therefore,  a  utility   reimbursement  does  not\n\nsubsidize energy  purchases unless  the tenant pays  at least\n\n                             -8-\n\none energy company for  the services provided.   Otherwise, a\n\nutility reimbursement is not an energy subsidy at all because\n\nit assiststhe tenantonly inpaying nonenergyutility providers.\n\n          In   response  to  the  Secretary's  argument  that\n\nutility reimbursements can never be energy assistance because\n\nthey might offset nonenergy utility costs, plaintiffs contend\n\nthat  utility reimbursements  are  always  energy  assistance\n\nbecause  they are  intended  \"primarily\" for  the payment  of\n\nenergy  bills.   A  committee  report  discussing the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion states  that  benefits provided  by the\n\nHome   Energy   Assistance  Act,   and   the  Energy   Crisis\n\nIntervention  and  Energy  Crisis  Assistance  Programs,  are\n\n\"energy assistance.\"  See  H.R. Rep. No. 788, 96th  Cong., 2d\n                         \n\nSess. 122-23 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 843, 955-\n                                 \n\n56.    Because  these  programs historically  provided  food,\n\nmedicine, and rental assistance,  as well as direct subsidies\n\nfor  fuel bills,  plaintiffs  contend that  Congress did  not\n\nintend \"energy  assistance\"  to  include  payments  only  for\n\nenergy utilities.  \n\n          Plaintiffs  fail  to  acknowledge   the  difference\n\nbetween  their   utility  reimbursements  and   the  benefits\n\nprovided under  the programs  discussed in the  House Report.\n\nAccording  to the report,  these programs provided assistance\n\nto offset the impact of high energy costs.  See id.; see also\n                                                             \n\n45 C.F.R.    1061.51-6(a), 1061.70-8.  At issue in this case,\n\n                             -9-\n\nhowever, are utility reimbursements that are designed in part\n\nto  offset nonenergy utility costs.  The analogy suggested by\n\nplaintiffs  is thus  not  apt; it  does  not clarify  whether\n\npayments designed  to account  for  a mixture  of energy  and\n\nnonenergy  expenses  are  \"energy assistance.\"    Neither the\n\nenergy  assistance   exclusion's  plain  language,   nor  its\n\nlegislative  history evince  an  intent  to exclude  payments\n\nprovided primarily for the purpose of energy assistance.  For\n                  \n\nthis reason,  we decline  plaintiffs' invitation to  read the\n\nword \"primarily\" or its equivalent into the statute.\n\n          The  Secretary argues that  a utility reimbursement\n\ncan never be a subsidy for the purchase of energy because the\n         \n\nallowance  may  be  based exclusively  on  nonenergy  utility\n\ncosts.   In all likelihood,  however, part of  every tenant's\n\nutility reimbursement is  based on an energy-related  utility\n\nallowance.     In   fact,  some   tenants   receive   utility\n\nreimbursements only  for energy utilities.   Named  plaintiff\n\nFelix St.  Peter's utility  reimbursement, for example,  is a\n\ntwo  party check made jointly payable to him and Maine Public\n\nService  Company.     See  24  C.F.R.       813.108,  913.108\n                         \n\n(providing  that  HUD  utility  reimbursements  may  be  made\n\npayable  to utility  providers).   The  energy and  nonenergy\n\ncomponents  of  a utility  allowance  are  itemized when  the\n\nallowance  is approved by FmHA and  HUD; this information may\n\nbe used to determine what fraction of a utility reimbursement\n\n                             -10-\n\nis energy-related.   FmHA  regulations require a  landlord to\n\nlist each  utility  allowance separately  when  seeking  FmHA\n\napproval for  the allowance, and to  provide this information\n\nto the tenant.  7 C.F.R. pt. 1944, subpt.

The  local public  housing agency  operating a  HUD\n\npublic housing project must maintain similar lists of utility\n\nallowances, and this information  is available to the tenant.\n\n24 C.F.R.    965.473, 965.474.  Although  HUD regulations for\n\nsection  8 privately-owned housing  do not explicitly require\n\nthat itemized  information on utility  allowances be retained\n\nfor  the  tenant,  this  is the  implication  of  regulations\n\nrequiring that HUD or the local public housing agency approve\n\nproposed allowances and that  allowances be reviewed annually\n\nfor  adjustments.    See,  e.g.,  id.      813.102,  882.116,\n                                     \n\n882.214.  We  assume that  HUD and the  local public  housing\n\nagency would  retain records of utility  allowances and would\n\nmake  this information  available  to the  tenant whose  rent\n\ndepends on that allowance. \n\n          Such information may be  used to determine how much\n\nof  a utility reimbursement is  in fact a  subsidy for energy\n\ncosts.  See South  Dakota Dep't of Soc. Servs.,  824 F. Supp.\n                                              \n\nat 1477  (\"computing the energy and  non-energy components of\n\n[utility   reimbursements]  would  be   a  simple  matter  of\n\narithmetic, not a great administrative burden\").

Structure of the Act:  Deductions and Exclusions\n\n          Turning to an analysis of the structure of the Act,\n\nwe consider  whether reading the  energy assistance exclusion\n\nin  context renders counter-intuitive or ambiguous Congress's\n\nintent on the meaning of \"energy assistance.\"  \n\n          The Secretary argues that the structure of the Food\n\nStamp  Act  indicates  that utility  reimbursements  are  not\n\n\"energy  assistance.\"  Income  eligibility determinations for\n\nfood stamps resemble income tax calculations,  see Department\n                                                             \n\nof Health  &amp; Welfare v.

The  Food Stamp  Act's \"standard  deduction\" and\n\n\"excess shelter cost  deduction\" account  for utility  costs.\n\nSee  7  U.S.C.     2014(e).    According  to  the  Secretary,\n   \n\nexcluding utility reimbursements as \"energy assistance\" would\n\nsubtract utility costs twice:  once as an exclusion and again\n\nas a deduction.\n\n          The  argument that  a payment  may not  be excluded\n\nbecause  it  offsets a  cost  already  accounted for  by  the\n\nstandard  deduction  is  not  persuasive.    All  households,\n\nregardless of  size,  receive the  standard deduction,  which\n\nonly in the most general sense reflects energy utility costs,\n\njust as it reflects many other costs.  The standard deduction\n\n                             -13-\n\nis a fixed  sum that  is adjusted annually  according to  the\n\nConsumer Price  Index  \"for items  other  than food  and  the\n\nhomeowners'  costs and  maintenance  and repair  component of\n\nshelter costs.\"  7 U.S.C.   2014(e).  \n\n          The deduction for excess shelter costs specifically\n\naccounts for  energy utilities, but  it does not  capture the\n\nentire cost  of  energy  utilities.   The  statute  allows  a\n\nhousehold  to  deduct shelter  expenses,  including  rent and\n\nutilities,  only  \"to  the  extent that  the  monthly  amount\n\nexpended by [the] household  for shelter\" exceeds 50%  of the\n\nhousehold's income  after  all  other  deductions  have  been\n\ntaken.    Id.   Deductible  expenses  include rent,  property\n             \n\ntaxes,   property  insurance,   and  mortgage   payments  and\n\ninterest,  as well  as  fuel,  electricity, water,  sewerage,\n\ntrash  collection, and  telephone  service.   See 7  C.F.R.  \n                                                 \n\n273.9(d)(5)(ii).   The cap  on the  deduction is adjusted  to\n\nreflect changes in the Consumer Price Index  for the shelter,\n\nfuel,  and utilities components of housing costs.  7 U.S.C.  \n\n2014(e).  \n\n          According to the Secretary, Congress could not have\n\nintended  to   exclude  the   energy  component   of  utility\n\nreimbursements,  given  the existence  of the  excess shelter\n\ncost  deduction.    But  the  Secretary  does  not  offer  an\n\nalternative construction of the Act that absolutely precludes\n\ndeducting  energy  utility costs  whenever  energy assistance\n\n                             -14-\n\npayments  are  excluded  from income.    Even  if the  energy\n\nassistance exclusion  were  intended to  cover only  payments\n\noffsetting  rising  energy  costs,  as  USDA  contends,   any\n\npayments  designed to  offset  rising energy  costs would  be\n\nexcluded,  while  the  energy   costs  themselves  would   be\n\ndeductible.    Implicit in  any  construction  of the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion  is   that  Congress  intended   energy\n\nassistance to  be  excluded and  energy utility  costs to  be\n\ndeducted,  to the extent that all shelter costs exceed 50% of\n\nmonthly income.  This is borne out in the legislative history\n\nof the energy assistance exclusion:  \"If a household receives\n\nan  energy allowance or grant, that allowance or grant is not\n\nto be included in income  at all, but the energy  costs which\n\nit  covers  may  continue  to be  treated  as  a  potentially\n\ndeductible shelter  expense when billed  or due.\"   H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 788, supra, at 123, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 956.\n              \n\n          As  a practical matter,  there is unlikely  to be a\n\nsubstantial overlap  between households excluding  the energy\n\ncomponent  of  utility  reimbursements  and  those  deducting\n\nexcess   shelter   costs.      Tenants    receiving   utility\n\nreimbursements pay no rent and incur no homeowners' expenses.\n\nThey are  entitled to the excess shelter  cost deduction only\n\nto the extent that  their utility costs alone exceed  half of\n                                             \n\ntheir monthly  income, including the  nonenergy component  of\n\n                             -15-\n\ntheir utility  reimbursements.3  In other  words, the poorest\n\nfood stamp recipients living  in public housing would exclude\n\nthe energy  component of their  utility reimbursements,  then\n\ndeduct the fraction of their utility bills exceeding half  of\n\ntheir  income.   This  result is  consistent  with the  Act's\n\npurpose to  alleviate hunger  and malnutrition  by augmenting\n\nthe  food  purchasing   power  of  participating   low-income\n\nhouseholds.   See 7 U.S.C.    2011.  We do not  find that the\n                 \n\nstructure of  the Food  Stamp Act  requires  that the  energy\n\nassistance  provision  be  construed  contrary  to  its plain\n\nlanguage.  Our reading of the provision in context reinforces\n\nour   determination  that   the   plain  language   manifests\n\nCongress's intent.  \n\n                   C.  Legislative History\n\n                    \n\n3For  administrative convenience  in  calculating the  excess\nshelter expense  deduction,  a \"standard  utility  allowance\"\n(SUA) may be  used in  lieu of a  household's actual  utility\ncosts.  7 C.F.R.   273.9(d)(6).  Households receiving \"energy\nassistance\"  may use  the  SUA only  if  they incur  \"out-of-\npocket\" heating or  cooling expenses.   7  U.S.C.    2014(e).\nThe Third  Circuit, having previously found impermissible the\nUSDA policy of counting utility reimbursements as income, see\n                                                             \nWest, 879  F.2d at  1132, subsequently  upheld a USDA  policy\n    \npreventing  recipients of  utility reimbursements  from using\nthe  SUA unless  their  actual utility  costs exceeded  their\npublic housing utility allowances,  see West v.

H.R. Rep. No. 788,  supra, at\n                                                         \n\n122,  1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 955.

Our  scrutiny of\n\nthe context, however, leads us to conclude that these remarks\n\nwere prompted by the concern that state and local governments\n\nmight  pass  off  increases  in  existing,  nonenergy-related\n\nwelfare  program  payments  as   \"energy  assistance.\"    See\n                                                             \n\nMaryland Dep't of Human  Res., 976 F.2d at 1470-71.   Because\n                             \n\nthe federal  government pays  the entire  cost of food  stamp\n\nbenefits,  7 U.S.C.   2013(a), such a ploy would increase the\n\nallotments  of  food  stamps to  a  state's  residents  at no\n\nsubstantial  cost  to the  state.   To  thwart  such efforts,\n\nCongress  subsequently  amended  the  exclusion   for  energy\n\nassistance  payments provided  under state  and local  laws.5\n\n                    \n\n5Section 2014(d)(11)(B) excludes from food stamp income,\n          any payments  or allowances made  for the\n          purpose of providing energy  assistance .\n          .  .  under  any  State  or   local  laws\n          designated   by   the   State  or   local\n          legislative    body   authorizing    such\n          payments   or    allowances   as   energy\n\n                             -19-\n\nSee Maryland Dep't of Human Res., 976 F.2d at  1471.  Utility\n                                \n\nreimbursements,  in  contrast,  are  provided  under  federal\n\nregulations that specify that the payments account for energy\n\nand nonenergy utility costs.  Although we do not dispute that\n\nthe  committee  intended  that  \"energy  assistance\"  include\n\nbenefits   offsetting  the   rising  cost   of  energy,   the\n\nlegislative  history of  the provision  reveals no  intent to\n\ncircumscribe the plain language of  the provision so that  it\n\nwould apply only to such benefits.  \n\n          Furthermore,   we   note   that   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation  of the  energy assistance exclusion  causes a\n\nresult  at odds with the legislative history.  The 1980 House\n\nReport  indicates that  typical  energy  assistance  programs\n\n\"hold low-income  households harmless  by permitting  them to\n\nbuy the same  amount of  energy they would  have utilized  in\n\npast years without having  to diminish their already marginal\n\n                    \n\n          assistance,   and   determined   by   the\n          Secretary to be calculated as if provided\n          by the State or local government involved\n          on  a seasonal  basis  for  an  aggregate\n          period not  to exceed  six months in  any\n          year even if such payments  or allowances\n          (including tax credits) are  not provided\n          on a  seasonal basis because  it would be\n          administratively       infeasible      or\n          impracticable to do so.\n\nUnlike  the  exclusion  for federal  energy  assistance, this\nstatute  expressly   provides   the  Secretary   a  role   in\ndetermining  whether payments  designated by  state or  local\ngovernments  as  \"energy  assistance\"  should  be  counted as\nincome.\n\n                             -20-\n\nincomes.\"    H.R.

An  exclusion  for such  assistance,\n\naccording  to the  House  Report, guarantees  that low-income\n\nhouseholds are held harmless for the assistance they receive.\n\nId.    Utility  reimbursements  with  energy  components  are\n   \n\ndesigned  in part to ensure that tenants, on average, will be\n\nable to purchase energy  utilities without spending more than\n\n30%  of household  income.   The allowances  underlying these\n\nreimbursements are  adjusted annually to  reflect substantial\n\nenergy  cost increases.  See, e.g., 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt.\n                                  \n\nC,  exh.  E.IX.C; 24  C.F.R.     882.214,  965.478.   In this\n\nmanner,  utility  reimbursements  ensure that  a  household's\n\nexpenditures for  energy remain  constant as a  percentage of\n\nhousehold  income, from  year to  year.   USDA's practice  of\n\ncounting the energy  component of  utility reimbursements  as\n\nincome does  not hold  tenants \"harmless\" for  the assistance\n\nthey receive.    \n\n          The Secretary argues  that Congress ratified USDA's\n\ninterpretation  of the  statute  when it  amended the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion  in  1988.    Prior  to  1988,  section\n\n2014(d)(11)(A)   exempted  from   income  \"any   payments  or\n\nallowances made  under any  Federal  law for  the purpose  of\n\nproviding energy assistance.\"  See West v. Bowen, 879 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1130.   Congress  reworded the  statute in  1988 so  that the\n\nprovision  currently excludes \"any payments or allowances for\n\n                             -21-\n\nthe purpose of providing  energy assistance under any Federal\n\nlaw.\"    A  Senate   committee  report  indicates  that  this\n\n\"technical amendment\" clarified\n\n          that  USDA and local agencies do not need\n          to conduct an inquiry into the purpose of\n          a   federal   statute  before   excluding\n          federal  \"payments  for  the  purpose  of\n          energy  assistance.\"    The  law  as  now\n          written could  be  read to  require  this\n          analysis.\n\n          The  crucial  question should  be whether\n          the  purpose of  the  payment  is  energy\n          assistance, not whether the statute, as a\n          whole, is primarily for energy assistance\n          or includes other human services as well.\n          This  change is  not  intended to  change\n                                                   \n          current policy.\n                         \n\nS.

Although  USDA treated\n\nutility  reimbursements  as income  before  1988,  the agency\n\nbased  this  practice on  the  faulty  interpretation of  the\n\nenergy  assistance  exclusion  that  the  1988  amendment was\n\ndesigned to correct.

Further  support for\n\nthis  interpretation  is  that  the committee  described  the\n\nrewording of  the statute  as a  \"technical amendment.\"   The\n\nstatement in  the legislative history that  the amendment \"is\n\nnot intended to change  current policy\" reaffirms that it  is\n\nnot a substantive revision of the statutory language.\n\n          The   Secretary's  final  argument   based  on  the\n\nlegislative history is that Congress expressed tacit approval\n\nof  USDA's  interpretation by  leaving  it in  place  when it\n\n                    \n\n6The district court in Mitchell cited the legislative history\n                               \nof the energy assistance exclusion as an alternate  basis for\nupholding the practice of counting utility reimbursements  as\nincome.

A\n                            \n\nlogical  prerequisite to  inferring approval  or ratification\n\nfrom silence  is that  the agency's interpretation  antedates\n\nany relevant amendments.  That is not so here.  Although USDA\n\nhas  invariably deemed  utility reimbursements  to be  income\n\nunder  the Food Stamp  Act, the  agency's rationale  for this\n\npractice  has changed over time.  Prior to the 1988 amendment\n\nof  the  Act,  the agency  asserted  in  litigation that  the\n\nexclusion applied  only to  payments made under  federal laws\n\nspecifically enacted to provide  energy assistance.  The 1988\n\namendment condemned  this interpretation, see West  v. Bowen,\n                                                            \n\n879 F.2d at 1322, and the agency abandoned it in favor of the\n\nposition it  espouses in this case,  that \"energy assistance\"\n\nrefers only  to  payments offsetting  rapidly  rising  energy\n\ncosts.   The interpretation of the statute at issue on appeal\n\nthus does not predate the 1988 amendment.  \n\n          We  have considered  USDA's unvarying  treatment of\n                                                          \n\nutility reimbursements as an  \"interpretation\" of the statute\n\ncapable  of ratification by silence, but we do not find great\n\nsignificance in Congress's inaction.  \"Congressional inaction\n\nfrequently    betokens    unawareness,   preoccupation,    or\n\nparalysis.\"   Zuber  v.

In the baker's dozen years that\n                           \n\nhave  passed  since  the  Food Stamp  Act  energy  assistance\n\nexclusion was enacted,  the Act has been  amended many times,\n\nbut  the exclusion itself has  been amended only  twice.  The\n\n1981 amendment  affected only  the provision  excluding state\n\nand  local  energy  assistance  payments.    The  legislative\n\nhistory of  the 1988 amendment reflects  a senate committee's\n\nappreciation  that USDA  misread  the statute,  but does  not\n\nindicate the  committee's awareness  of  USDA's treatment  of\n\nutility reimbursements.  See  S. Rep. No. 397, supra,  at 28,\n                                                    \n\n1988  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 2266  (stating  that  \"USDA and  local\n\nagencies do not need  to conduct an inquiry into  the purpose\n\nof a federal  statute before  excluding\" energy  assistance).\n\nTherefore, even if what the senate committee recognized about\n\nthe   agency's  prior   misreading   of  the   statute   were\n\nattributable  to the  entire Congress,  this would  not prove\n\ncongressional   cognizance  of   the  treatment   of  utility\n\nreimbursements. \n\n          There are still fewer facts outside the legislative\n\nhistory supporting an  inference of congressional  awareness.\n\nUSDA  has  not embodied  its  interpretation  of the  federal\n\nenergy assistance  exclusion in a regulation.   Moreover, our\n\nresearch  uncovered  nothing   suggesting  that  the   agency\n\n                             -25-\n\nembodied its position on utility reimbursements in any agency\n\npublication prior  to 1990, when it  issued policy statements\n\non  the  matter.   And  the  only courts  considering  USDA's\n\ntreatment  of  utility reimbursements  prior  to 1988  issued\n\nunpublished opinions.  E.g., West, No. 84-3883; Mitchell, No.\n                                                        \n\n82-3297-3.   Furthermore,  the  policy  of including  utility\n\nreimbursements in  food stamp  income affects only  very poor\n\nFmHA and HUD tenants, persons unlikely to  have the resources\n\nto  publicize  their  plight.    We  cannot  infer  from  the\n\nlegislative history  and from these  facts that congressional\n\nsilence  signals ratification of the agency's policy.  Nor do\n\nwe find in the legislative history any statements belying our\n\ndetermination that Congress's intended meaning for the energy\n\nassistance exclusion is manifested by its plain language.\n\n                        D.  Deference\n\n          The  Secretary argues  that  we must  defer to  the\n\nagency's  judgment   on  the  applicability   of  the  energy\n\nassistance exclusion  to utility reimbursements  because this\n\nauthority  has   been  expressly  delegated  to  the  agency.\n\nAccording  to the  Secretary, Congress  explicitly called  on\n\nUSDA to determine whether any payments provided under federal\n\n\"laws not specifically  dealing with energy assistance\"  were\n\n\"energy-assistance related.\"   H.R.  Rep. No. 788,  supra, at\n                                                         \n\n123,  1980  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at  956.

Rep. No. 788,  supra, at 123,  1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n                              \n\n956, and we  noted that the remarks reflected the committee's\n\nconcern  that  state  or  local governments  might  pass  off\n\nincreases in  general welfare as energy  assistance.  Utility\n\nreimbursements,   in  contrast,  are  authorized  by  federal\n\nregulations specifying that  the payments account  for energy\n\nutility  costs.    The   legislative  history  cited  by  the\n\nSecretary  does  not  empower   USDA  to  refine  the  energy\n\nassistance  exclusion so that it does not apply to the energy\n\ncomponent of a utility reimbursement.    Finally,         the\n\nSecretary  contends  that  USDA's  policy  should  be  upheld\n\nbecause,  under Chevron,  courts  must defer  to an  agency's\n                       \n\nreasonable  interpretation  of   a  statute  it  administers.\n\nChevron prescribes that courts  employ a two-step analysis of\n       \n\nan  agency's interpretation of a statute it administers.  See\n                                                             \n\nDion,  933 F.2d at 14-15.  Deference is appropriate only when\n    \n\nthe legislative intent is unclear.  See St. Luke's Hosp., 810\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 331.  In this case, the plain language of the statute\n\nmanifests Congress's  intent on the  question at issue:   any\n\npayment designed to offset energy costs is excluded from food\n\n                             -27-\n\nstamp  income,  not just  payments offsetting  rapidly rising\n\nenergy costs.  We conclude that the energy component of a HUD\n\nor FmHA utility reimbursement, as  a subsidy for the purchase\n\nof  energy,   must  be   excluded  from  food   stamp  income\n\ncalculations.    Any  policy  of  USDA  to  the  contrary  is\n\nimpermissible.\n\n          The decision of the district court is therefore\n\n          Reversed.    \n          Reversed.\n                   \n\n          Dissent follows.\n\n                             -28-\n\n        CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).

Recipients of HUD and FmHA URs can lay claim\n\nto  no  special burden  under the  food  stamp scheme.   Congress\n             \n\nitself has recognized the principle of \"fairness\" which underlies\n\n                    \n\n7Given the  FSA's complex structure, and  the internal cross-\nreferences  in  Exclusion  11  to  other  federal  and  state\nstatutes of comparable complexity,  it is difficult to accept\nthe  facile    conclusion  that  segregation  of  the  energy\ncomponent from the nonenergy components in  URs would pose no\nsignificant  administrative  burden.    The  USDA  vigorously\ninsists otherwise, and the district  court prudently bypassed\nthe entire administrative implementation  issue.  See  Estey,\n                                                            \n814 F. Supp. at 158 n.2.  On the other hand, this court bases\nits  \"minimal  administrative  burden\" thesis  solely  on  an\nexamination of the cold  appellate record, including the FSA,\nHUD, and  FmHA implementing regulations, without  the benefit\nof a developed record relating to the types of problems which\nmight portend serious administrative burdens.\n   The USDA does  not set,  monitor, or control  HUD or  FmHA\nutility  allowances,  nor  the  annual  adjustments to  those\n                                                   \nallowances.    Thus, even  though  segregation  may appear  a\n\"simple  matter of  arithmetic\"  in the  abstract, it  cannot\nsimply be assumed that segregation would not entail elaborate\ninter-agency  monitoring and policing    for example, between\nthe  USDA and  HUD  to  ensure  that  food  stamp  recipients\ncorrectly declare the appropriate  components of their URs as\nexcludible income.  Absent some contrary evidence, therefore,\nthe  USDA's  assessment of  the  likely  burdens entailed  in\nimplementing such  an  administrative regime  warrants  prima\nfacie deference.\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nthe  FSA's narrowly-drawn  income exclusions,  and the  competing\n\ninterests at stake in any  benefit allocation made by government.\n\nSee  H.R.

While acknowledging that\n                            \n\nfamilies  with the lowest incomes  often feel the financial brunt\n\nof this congressional policy choice, the USDA assiduously acts to\n\nfurther that legislative policy  by treating as includible income\n                                                               \n\nmany  other routine  and  need-based  assistance  payments  which\n                                  \n\nincrease a family's real  purchasing power.

With respect, I  believe both  are\n\nflawed.   First, moving  beyond its questionable  conclusion that\n\nnothing  in  House  Report  No. 788  confirms  the  USDA's inter-\n                                           \n\npretation  of  \"energy assistance  [payments],\" the  court states\n\nthat the USDA's policy  choice is \"at odds\" with  the legislative\n                            \n\nhistory.   See  supra p.  19.   The court's  statement presumably\n                   \n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\nstems  from two premises: (1) USDA's practice of including URs as\n\nfood stamp \"income\" fails to  hold food stamp families \"harmless\"\n\nby ensuring  that \"a  household's expenditures for  energy remain\n\nconstant as a percentage of household income, from year to year,\"\n\nand  (2)   hypothetical  UR  payments   might  sometimes  contain\n\nreimbursements for  superinflationary energy cost  increases, for\n\nwhich URs  would hold tenants \"harmless.\"  In order to assess the\n\nsoundness of  these  two  premises,  it  is  necessary  first  to\n\ndetermine  what Congress meant when it said that the \"new\" energy\n\nprograms were designed to  hold recipient families \"harmless\" for\n                                                          \n\n\"energy assistance\" payments, LIHEAP being  a known type of \"new\"\n                                                      \n\nenergy assistance payment.\n\n        Congress enacted LIHEAA  intending that \"new\"  programs\n\nof its  type would supplement preexisting governmental assistance\n                           \n\nprograms which had not previously provided benefit adjustments to\n                    \n\nlow income households to account for  energy cost increases which\n\noutpaced  general cost-of-living increases.  See S. Rep. No. 394,\n                                              \n\nsupra, at  111 (expressing concern that  \"the ordinary mechanisms\n                                                               \n\nfor adjusting  income assistance programs to the  rising costs of\n\nliving  may be  inadequate  to meet  the extraordinary  increases\n                                                    \n\nwhich have taken place in energy costs\") (emphasis added).  Thus,\n\nwhen  enacting  LIHEAA,   Congress  ostensibly  determined   that\n\npreexisting  statutory  mechanisms  for  making  adjustments  for\n\n\"substantial  [energy   rate]  increases,\"  like   those  already\n\nincorporated in the FSA, HUD and FmHA programs, were ill-designed\n\nto offset  recent and  unprecedented \"spike\" increases  in energy\n\n                             -38-\n                              38\n\ncosts, and opted to  reimburse food stamp recipients in  full for\n                                                           \n\nall otherwise unreimbursed expenditures for these past and future\n\n\"spike\" increases.  Cf. 42 U.S.C.   8624(f) (LIHEAP  payments not\n                     \n\nincludible  as \"income\" in  calculating food stamp entitlements).\n\nThus, in  two  senses, food  stamp  recipients realized  no  real\n                                                               \n\n\"gain\"  from LIHEAA:  (1)  LIHEAP payments  merely offset  super-\n\ninflationary  energy cost  increases, and  food  stamp recipients\n\nwere  simply restored to their pre-OPEC financial position, so as\n\nto  afford  them the  same  amount of  energy  as before  the oil\n                                           \n\ncrisis,  without loss of real spending power, and (2) since these\n                                               \n\nsuperinflationary energy cost increases  were not being offset by\n\nany other  statutory cost-of-living assistance  provision, LIHEAP\n\npayments would effect  no double compensation, or \"gain,\" to food\n                              \n\nstamp  families.  In  these respects, therefore,  LIHEAA worked a\n\ncomplete \"wash.\"\n      \n\n        On the other hand,  consider the following hypothetical\n\ncalculations  of representative  housing assistance  payments and\n\nURs:  \n                                      1990      1991\n                                                    \n\n             approved rent            $300      $300\n           + utility allowance        $ 60      $ 72\n                                                    \n           = approved shelter cost    $360      $372\n           - 30% family income        $ 45      $ 45\n               of $150\n                                                    \n             housing assistance       $315      $327\n               payment\n           - approved rent            $300      $300\n                                                    \n             utility reimbursement    $ 15      $ 27\n\n                             -39-\n                              39\n\nThe  utility allowance,  which  may  or  may not  reflect  actual\n                                                               \n\nutility costs, is an average  figure calculated by the \"landlord\"\n\nfor  all units in  a covered facility, and  is designed to afford\n\ntenants  an \"adequate\" allowance  for household  utilities, while\n\ndeterring  inefficient energy usage.   As  the court  points out,\n\n\"substantial\" annual  increases in energy rates  (e.g., more than\n                                                    \n\n10%) might require the \"landlord\" to make corresponding increases\n\nin the pre-set utility allowance.   See 7 C.F.R. pt. 1930, subpt.\n                                     \n\nC, exh. E.IX.C; 24 C.F.R.    882.214, 965.478.  So, in  our hypo-\n\ntheticals, if utility rates increased to $72 over one year, a 20%\n\nincrease, the tenant's UR would increase from $15 to $27.  If the\n\ngeneral or across-the-board inflation rate for the same year were\n\nonly 15%, then one-quarter of the $12 increase in the  UR paid to\n\nthe tenant, or $3, could  be considered an additional  reimburse-\n               \n\nment for  utility cost increases beyond  the general inflationary\n\nrate,  and some lesser portion  of that segregable  payment of $3\n\nwould be  for superinflationary  energy (as opposed  to nonenergy\n                                     \n\nutility) price  increases.  Accordingly, our  hypothetical $27 UR\n\nwould include three components:  basic energy cost ($15), general\n\ninflationary increase ($9), and superinflationary increase ($3).\n\n        When  the  identical   \"hold  harmless\"  analysis  just\n\napplied  to  LIHEAP  is  applied  to  the  housing  URs  Congress\n\nestablished prior to  its enactment  of LIHEAA, the  flaw in  the\n\nthesis  advanced by  the  court becomes  clear.8   Unlike  LIHEAP\n\n                    \n\n8The court  concludes that  \"USDA's practice of  counting the\nenergy component  of [URs]  as income does  not hold  tenants\n'harmless'  for the assistance they  receive.\"  See supra pp.\n                                                         \n\n                             -40-\n                              40\n\npayments, URs simply  are not  payments made pursuant  to a  \"new\n                           \n\nprogram\" as  specifically referred  to in  House Report  No. 788.\n\n[See  supra  p.  9.]    For  example,  HUD's  section  8  housing\n         \n\nlegislation was enacted in  1974, see P.L. No. 93-383,    201(a),\n                                   \n\n88 Stat. 653  (1974) (codified at 42 U.S.C.    1437), well before\n\nCongress  can   reasonably  be  thought  to   have  foreseen  the\n\nsuperinflationary energy  price increases experienced in the late\n\n1970s.   When  URs  were first  established, therefore,  Congress\n                            \n\ncould not  have contemplated, let  alone intended, that  the UR's\n\n\"basic cost\" component ($15) or its \"general inflation\" component\n\n($9) would hold recipient families  \"harmless\" in the two special\n                                                       \n\nsenses  in which LIHEAA later benefited its recipients.  Prior to\n\ntheir initial entitlement to  URs, low income families presumably\n\npaid the full $60 utility  cost from income; whereas  immediately\n\nafter  the establishment of URs, it cost the same family only $45\n\nto purchase  the same amount of  energy it had purchased  for $60\n                          \n\nthe  previous  year.    Congress  established  the  \"basic  cost\"\n\ncomponent in utility allowances and  URs to reduce the percentage\n                                                \n\nof household  income that must be expended  for energy regardless\n                                                               \n\nof  past inflationary  trends.   Thus  coupled  with an  adequate\n\ninternal  mechanism  for  making future  adjustments  for general\n\ninflationary  increases, the  UR worked  a real  $15  increase in\n                                                            \n\noverall purchasing power, not merely a \"wash.\"\n\n                    \n\n20-21.  Regardless whether this is the right answer, however,\nthe  court has not posed the right question.  The appropriate\ninquiry  is whether these HUD and  FmHA housing programs were\n                                               \nintended to hold families harmless in the same way LIHEAA was\nmeant to do.\n\n                             -41-\n                              41\n\n        At  most,  therefore,  the court  has  demonstrated  in\n\ntheory that the USDA might be required at some time in the future\n\nto exclude a relatively small portion of some URs from food stamp\n\n\"income\";  viz.,  the $3  (or less)  of  the hypothetical  $27 UR\n             \n\nattributable  to any  \"superinflationary  component.\"   But  this\n\ntheory inevitablyimports seriousconceptual impediments ofits own.\n\n        First, in  defense of this theory  the court disregards\n                                                               \n\nthe  unitary nature  of UR  payments, opining  that the  USDA can\n          \n\neasily segregate URs into  their energy and nonenergy components,\n\nthereby  smoothing  the path  for  its conclusion  that  the UR's\n\nenergy  component  alone  qualifies  for  \"exclusion\"   from  FSA\n\n\"income.\"  See supra pp. 10-11;  but cf. supra pp. 31-32.  Having\n                                            \n\nthus disregarded  the unitary  nature of  UR payments, the  court\n\ncannot  then  credibly  suggest  that the  USDA  would  be acting\n\narbitrarily by segregating and  excluding from FSA income a  UR's\n                                                       \n\nhypothetical superinflationary  component ($3) while at  the same\n\ntime  including   the  UR's  \"basic  cost\"   ($15)  and  \"general\n\ninflation\"  ($9) components  in  FSA income.    Second, and  more\n\nimportantly,  no  part  of any  UR  will  include  such a  super-\n\ninflationary component during periods of subinflationary, stable,\n\nor  declining energy prices.   Indeed, the USDA  concedes that it\n\nmay be appropriate to exclude from FSA income a UR which actually\n                                                               \n\nrepresents   a   reimbursement   for   superinflationary   energy\n\nincreases.  Given general  economic trends in the late  1980s and\n\nearly 1990s,  however, appellants advisedly have  not argued that\n\ntheir  own   URs  covered  any   superinflationary  energy  price\n\n                             -42-\n                              42\n\nincreases, nor do they suggest that USDA has attempted to include\n\nany  such superinflationary  component  in any  other food  stamp\n\nrecipient's \"income.\"  Rather, the USDA continues to  include HUD\n\nand FmHA  URs in food  stamp \"income\" on  the theory that  unless\n\nproven to  contain some superinflationary  component, current HUD\n\nand FmHA URs presumably reimburse only \"routine\" energy costs and\n\nsubinflationary  increases in  energy  costs.   The current  USDA\n             \n\nregulations flexibly  track this presumption by  reference to the\n\nincludibility of all reimbursements  for \"normal household living\n\nexpenses.\"    As a consequence, I  find no support for the thesis\n\nthat the USDA's policy  choice is \"at odds\" with  the legislative\n\nhistory.\n\n        State \"Energy Assistance\" Payments\n                                          \n\n        As its  second rejoinder, the court  takes the position\n\nthat the language  quoted from House Report No. 788, see supra at\n                                                            \n\npp.  17-18, considered  in  context, can  lead to  one reasonable\n\nconclusion only    that  Congress was particularly concerned that\n\n\"state  and  local  governments   might  pass  off  increases  in\n\nexisting, nonenergy-related  welfare program payments  as 'energy\n\nassistance'\" so as to  shift local welfare burdens  to federally-\n\nfunded  programs (e.g., the  FSA program).   Once again, however,\n                    \n\nthis thesis does not withstand close scrutiny, let alone begin to\n\ndispel the  plausibility of the alternative view  advanced by the\n\nUSDA.\n\n        If  this sort  of  burden shifting  had  indeed been  a\n\nmatter  of significant legislative concern,  it would have been a\n\n                             -43-\n                              43\n\nsimple matter for  Congress to authorize  a FSA income  exclusion\n\nfor  all  bona fide  energy cost  assistance  paid to  food stamp\n                 \n\nrecipients  by the States.   All  Congress need  have done  is to\n\nrequire States  to satisfy  the Secretary  that any increases  in\n\nstate-paid benefits  were for food stamp  recipients' energy cost\n\nincreases,  rather  than  their  nonenergy cost  increases.    In\n\naddition to its threshold  requirement that energy cost increases\n\nbe   the  \"but-for   cause\"  of   any   increase  in   a  state's\n\nreimbursements,  however, Congress  imposed a  second, subsidiary\n\ncondition:      even   a   state's   bona   fide   energy-related\n                                              \n\nreimbursements should be  exempt under Exclusion 11  \"only to the\n                                                               \n\nextent  that  the  [benefit]  increase is  attributable  to  high\n                                                               \n\nheating costs rather than  general inflationary conditions.\"  The\n                                                        \n\ncourt has not explained  how Congress could have meant  to thwart\n\nimproper diversions of State welfare program costs by prohibiting\n\nFSA income  exclusions for bona fide  subinflationary energy cost\n                                  \n\nreimbursements by  a  State, if  federal  payments for  the  same\n\npurposes  were readily  excludible from  food stamp  income.   In\n\nsharp   contrast, the reading given  House Report No. 788  by the\n\nUSDA  dovetails neatly  with the  stated goals  of \"new\"  federal\n\nprograms,  such   as  LIHEAA,  which  Congress   referred  to  as\n\nprototypes  of  federal   \"intervention\"  payments  for   \"energy\n\nassistance.\"\n\n        In   conclusion,   the    USDA's   interpretation    is\n\ncorroborated  both  by a  reasonable  reading  of Exclusion  11's\n\nambiguous  language and  its legislative  history.   There  is no\n\n                             -44-\n                              44\n\nstatutory  or  historical  evidence whatever  that  Congress  has\n\nevinced a \"specific intention\" to include HUD and FmHA URs within\n\nthe Exclusion 11 language:  \"payment[s] . . . for  energy assist-\n\nance.\"   Congress has never once  alluded to HUD and  FmHA URs as\n\n\"energy  assistance [payments],\"  even  though URs  preceded  the\n\nenactment of Exclusion 11 by some six years.  See, e.g., P.L. No.\n                                                     \n\n93-383,    201(a), 88 Stat. 653 (1974).  Chevron deference is not\n                                              \n\ndependent on  a determination  \"that the agency  construction was\n\nthe  only [permissible] one . . . , or even the reading the court\n       \n\nwould  have reached  if the  question initially  had arisen  in a\n\njudicial setting.\"  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11.\n                         \n\n        Notwithstanding its able effort to dispel the  permeant\n\nambiguity  in  the relevant  legislative  history, and  interpret\n\nExclusion 11 apart from its unique historical  context, the court\n\nhas  disclosed no  suggestion  that Congress  ever intimated  its\n\ndisapproval of  the USDA's  longstanding policy  against treating\n\nroutine utility reimbursements as \"energy assistance [payments].\"\n\nAlthough  I recognize  that \"[c]ongressional  inaction frequently\n                                                    \n\nbetokens  unawareness, preoccupation,  or paralysis,\"  Zuber, 396\n                                                          \n\nU.S. at 185-86 n.21,  Congress has amended Exclusion 11  not once\n\nbut twice since the USDA adopted its present policy on URs.
