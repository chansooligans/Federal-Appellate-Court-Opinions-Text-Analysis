In Swift, the Supreme  Court\n                                         \nheld that  \"[n]othing less than  a clear showing  of grievous\nwrong evoked by new and  unforeseen conditions should lead us\nto change what was decreed after years of litigation with the\nconsent of all concerned.\"  Swift, 286 U.S. at 119.\n                                 \n\n4.  \"In Bell,  the [Supreme  Court] held that  double-bunking\n            \nwas  not in all  circumstances unconstitutional.\"   Rufo, 148\n                                                        \nF.R.D. at 16.\n\n                             -4-\n\nF.2d 1557  (1st Cir.  1990).  It  held that  the Sheriff  had\n\nfailed to meet  the standard for the  modification of consent\n\ndecrees imposed  by United  States v. Swift  &amp; Co.,  286 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n106, 119, 52  S. Ct. 460,  464, 76 L.  Ed. 999 (1932).5   The\n\ndistrict court  also \"stated  that, even  under the  flexible\n\nmodification standard adopted by other Courts of Appeals, the\n\n[S]heriff  would not  be  entitled  to  relief  because  `[a]\n\nseparate cell  for each detainee has always been an important\n\nelement of the relief sought in this litigation  perhaps even\n\nthe most  important element.'\"   Rufo, 112  S.

Civ.  P.   60(b)  does   not  intend   that\n\n\"modifications of  consent decrees in  all cases [are]  to be\n\ngoverned by the standard actually applied in Swift . . . [but\n                                                  \n\nrather] permits  a less stringent, more  flexible standard\").\n\nThe Court observed that \"[t]he experience of the district and\n\ncircuit courts in implementing and modifying such decrees has\n\ndemonstrated that a  flexible approach is often  essential to\n\nachieving the  goals of  [institutional] reform  litigation.\"\n\nId. at 758.   Against this backdrop,  the Court held that  \"a\n   \n\nparty  seeking modification  of a  consent  decree bears  the\n\n[initial] burden of establishing that a significant change in\n\ncircumstances warrants revision  of the decree.\"  Id. at 760.\n                                                     \n\nTo meet this initial burden, a party  seeking modification of\n\nan institutional  reform consent  decree may  show \"either  a\n\nsignificant change in  factual conditions  or in  law.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nOnce the party seeking modification meets this standard, \"the\n\ncourt should  consider whether  the proposed modification  is\n\nsuitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"6  Id. \n                                                     \n\n                    \n\n6.  The standard announced by the Rufo Court applies  only to\n                                      \nmotions  to modify institutional reform consent decrees.  The\n                  \nCourt did not  have before it the \"question  [of] whether [in\nwhole or in part] the . . . decree should be vacated.\"  Rufo,\n                                                            \n112 S.

The  court also\n\nconsidered  two  other  motions  filed  after  the  case  was\n\nremanded,  one of which was the Commissioner's present motion\n\nto vacate  the  consent decree  altogether.7   See Rufo,  148\n                                                       \n\nF.R.D. at 15.  The district court denied all three motions.\n\n          The  district  court explained  its  denial  of the\n\nSheriff's motion for modification to allow  double-bunking of\n\npretrial  detainees   at  the   Nashua  Street   Jail  in   a\n\ncomprehensive   opinion,  concluding   that  \"the   Sheriff's\n\nproposed modification  [was] not suitably tailored to changed\n\ncircumstances shown by the record.\"  Id. at 24.  According to\n                                        \n\nthe district court, the Sheriff  had not \"made [a] showing of\n\nreasoned  exploration  of  other feasible  alternatives  that\n\nwould  maintain rather  than  impair  the  integrity  of  the\n\nconsent decree.\"  Id.  Nevertheless, the district court ruled\n                     \n\nthat,  \"[t]hough [it] ha[d] rejected the Sheriff's request to\n\ndouble-bunk,  . .  . it  does not  follow that  no acceptable\n\nalternative could  be fashioned  for  a modified  use of  the\n\nNashua  Street  facility  in  a   way  that  would  meet  the\n\n                    \n\n7.  The third motion  was a \"motion of the  Sheriff to modify\nthe consent decree to hold  up to forty Suffolk County female\npretrial  detainees at the Suffolk County House of Correction\nat South  Bay, Boston, Massachusetts.\"   Rufo, 148  F.R.D. at\n                                             \n15.\n\n                             -7-\n\nobjectives  of  the   consent  decree,  including  protection\n\nagainst abuse and undue risk  of contagion.\"  Id.  Therefore,\n                                                 \n\nthe  district  court  did  \"not  foreclose  consideration  of\n\nanother proposal submitted promptly, with evidentiary support\n\nthat  justifies a  finding  that it  is suitably  tailored to\n\nchanges  in   circumstances,  beyond   the  control  of   the\n\ndefendants after due effort,  from the circumstances existing\n\nwhen the decree  was entered (or from  circumstances existing\n\nwhen it  was modified).\"  Id.   The Sheriff appealed from the\n                             \n\ndistrict court's  denial of  his two motions,  but agreed  to\n\nstay his appeal  pending further proceedings on  a new motion\n\nto  modify filed  in the  district  court.   We were  told at\n\nargument  that  proceedings  regarding  this  motion  are  in\n\nprogress in the district court.  \n\n          In  explaining  its  denial  of the  Commissioner's\n\nseparate  motion to vacate  the consent decree,  the district\n\ncourt began  by stating that the Commissioner did not support\n\nthe   Sheriff's   proposal  for   modification   because  the\n\nCommissioner  felt that  \"the plan would  require unnecessary\n\njudicial involvement  in the day-to-day administration of the\n\njail.\"    Id. at  23.    The district  court  noted that  the\n             \n\nCommissioner objected to being forced  by orders in this case\n\nto  accept from  the  Sheriff the  overflow  from the  Nashua\n\nStreet Jail.  The district court went on to say: \n\n               Rather than submitting  his own plan\n          for modification, . . . the  Commissioner\n\n                             -8-\n\n          challenges  the consent  decree and  this\n          court's  jurisdiction   over  the   case,\n          arguing that  it is  no longer  equitable\n          for   the   consent    decree   to   have\n          prospective effect. . . .\n\n                            * * * \n\n               The Commissioner's  proposed way  of\n          avoiding undue  involvement of  the court\n          in  day-to-day   implementation  of   the\n          consent   decree   is   an   unacceptable\n          extreme  simply  let  the   Sheriff  have\n          unfettered  discretion  to  order double-\n          bunking   without   any   constraints  or\n          limitations  as  to   criteria  regarding\n          associated  conditions  of   confinement.\n          The Commissioner  contends not  only that\n          the court should not require that single-\n          bunking be maintained  but also that  the\n          court should  not require that  any other\n          safeguards  be  instituted   in  lieu  of\n          single-bunking   to    carry   out    the\n          objectives of the decree as fashioned  by\n          consent.    This  hard-line  approach  is\n          plainly  incompatible  with  this court's\n          obligation, under the order of remand, to\n          consider     whether     any     proposed\n          modification  of  the consent  decree  is\n          suitably     tailored      to     changed\n          circumstances.     The  Commissioner   of\n          Corrections' position  must be  rejected.\n          His motion, accordingly, is denied.\n\nId.\n   \n\n                             II.\n\n          On  appeal,   the  Commissioner  argues   that  the\n\ndistrict court applied  the wrong legal standard  when ruling\n\non his motion to vacate the consent decree.  The Commissioner\n\nasserts  that  the  district  court  mistakenly  applied  the\n\nSupreme Court's Rufo  standard, which he says relates only to\n                    \n\nmotions  to  modify,  not  to  vacate,  institutional  reform\n                                     \n\n                             -9-\n\nconsent decrees.   According to the Commissioner,  a district\n\ncourt that  rules upon  a motion  to vacate  an institutional\n\nreform   consent  decree  must   consider  only  whether  the\n\ndefendants  are  in  present compliance  with  constitutional\n\nrequirements  and  whether   the  effects  of   the  original\n\nviolation  have abated.   Maintaining  that  these conditions\n\nhave  been met, the  Commissioner contends that  the district\n\ncourt erred in refusing to vacate  the decree, and he seeks a\n\nremand so that the court can reconsider the issue.\n\n          Although  we  agree   with  the  Commissioner  that\n\nmotions to vacate consent decrees  and motions to modify them\n\ninvolve somewhat different analytical frameworks, we find the\n\nCommissioner's proposed standard inadequate.   We also  think\n\nthat,  whatever the weaknesses  of its stated  rationale, the\n\nlower  court properly declined  to vacate the  consent decree\n\nunder the present circumstances and at the present time. \n\n                             III.\n\n          As an initial matter, \"[w]e note that  [describing]\n\nthe appropriate  legal standard  [to be  applied by  district\n\ncourts  to  motions  to vacate  institutional  reform consent\n\ndecrees] presents a pure question  of law, subject to de novo\n                                                             \n\nreview.\"       Societe  des  Produits  Nestle, S.A.  v.

While  the desegregation cases  have a\n\nspecial history and  context all their own, many  of the same\n\nconsiderations would appear to be relevant to  other types of\n\n                             -11-\n\ninstitutional reform litigation.

This circuit  has invoked this  principle in\n\nother kinds of institutional reform cases.  See  Pearson, 990\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 658 (\"In institutional reform litigation, injunctions\n\nshould not  operate inviolate in  perpetuity.\"); Glover,  989\n                                                       \n\n                             -12-\n\nF.2d at 68  (\"[I]nstitutional reform decrees need  not endure\n\nforever.\").

Ct. at 1446, the  Supreme Court indicated\n          \n\nthat  there are  two conditions  that  must be  met before  a\n\ndistrict  court  is  essentially   obliged  to  terminate   a\n\nlitigated decree and return the institution or programs under\n\ncourt  supervision  to  the  governance  of  state  or  local\n\nauthorities.\n\nFirst,  the district court must determine that the underlying\n\nconstitutional  wrong has been  remedied, either fully  or to\n\nthe full extent now deemed practicable.  See Dowell, 498 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 247,  249-50; Glover, 989 F.2d at  69.  Second, there must\n                       \n\nbe  a determination that  the authorities have  complied with\n\nthe  decree in  good faith  for a  reasonable period  of time\n\nsince  it was  entered.   See  Freeman, 112  S. Ct.  at 1446;\n                                      \n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50.\n      \n\n                             -13-\n\n          Implicit  in these requirements is the need for the\n\ndistrict court, before terminating the decree entirely, to be\n\nsatisfied  that there is  relatively little or  no likelihood\n\nthat the  original constitutional violation  will promptly be\n\nrepeated when the decree is lifted.   See Dowell, 498 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n247  (\"[A]  finding .  .  .  that  the Oklahoma  City  School\n\nDistrict was being  operated in compliance with  the commands\n\nof the Equal  Protection Clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nand that  it was unlikely that the  Board would return to its\n                                                             \n\nformer  ways, would  be a  finding that  the purposes  of the\n            \n\ndesegregation litigation had been fully achieved.\"  (emphasis\n\nadded)).  Whether authorities are likely to return to  former\n\nways  once  the  decree  is  dissolved  may  be  assessed  by\n\nconsidering \"[t]he defendants' past  record of compliance and\n\ntheir  present attitudes toward  the reforms mandated  by the\n\ndecree.\"   Lloyd  C.  Anderson,  Release  and  Resumption  of\n                                                             \n\nJurisdiction  Over  Consent  Decrees  in  Structural   Reform\n                                                             \n\nLitigation,  42  U.

Of\n                   \n\npossible  further relevance  is  the  way  that  demographic,\n\neconomic, and political  forces may be expected  to influence\n\nlocal authorities and the institution once the shelter of the\n\ndecree has been lost.\n\n          Obviously,  there can be  no perfect certainty that\n\nthe original  constitutional violation will  not be repeated.\n\n                             -14-\n\nNo one can demand such an assurance too far into the  future.\n\nBut  it would  be a  travesty  of the  two requirements  just\n\nstated      that the  violation  be eliminated  and  that the\n\nofficials have shown their commitment to obey the law    if a\n\ndecree  could  be  terminated  in  the  face  of  substantial\n\nevidence that  the same  underlying violation  would then  be\n\nresumed.\n\n          These  general  statements   leave  many  questions\n\nunanswered.    One, as  already mentioned,  is the  extent to\n\nwhich  they can  be extended  from  the school  desegregation\n\ncases,  in  which the  statements  were  made, to  all  other\n\ninstitutional  reform   decrees  including   those  involving\n\nprisons.  Our tentative view,  as said, is that they probably\n\ncan be  so extended, although  the point need not  be decided\n\ndefinitively.  Another question,  perhaps more perplexing, is\n\nwhether there ought to be any difference in treatment between\n\na  litigated decree  and a  consent decree  when it  comes to\n\nstandards  for termination;  arguments can  be  made on  both\n\nsides   and,  again,  we  need  not  definitely  resolve  the\n\nquestion.  Finally,  there is the question of  whether and to\n\nwhat extent the  \"extra\" remedial protections of  the decree,\n\nat least if embodied in a bargained-for consent decree, ought\n\nto  remain  relevant when  the underlying  federal violations\n\nhave entirely ceased and  are not likely to  recur.  As  with\n\n                             -15-\n\nthe  others, there are  plausible arguments on  both sides of\n\nthis question.8  \n\n          We see no need, however, to resolve these issues at\n\nthis  time.  For purposes of the present appeal, it is enough\n\nto  assume arguendo  that  the  proper  standard  for  decree\n                   \n\ntermination is  the one  most favorable  to the  Commissioner\n\nthat we can imagine being  adopted by the Supreme Court.   On\n\nthis view  of the  law, the  Commissioner  would arguably  be\n\nentitled to  termination of  the decree  if the  Commissioner\n\ncould  show: that  the federal  violations  of the  type that\n\nprovoked the original  action have been entirely  remedied or\n\nremedied  to the  full extent  feasible;9  that a  reasonable\n\n                    \n\n8.  The plaintiffs, for instance, argue that the purposes and\nrequirements of the consent decree continue to deserve weight\n                                  \neven  if  it  is  assumed  that a  defendant  has  come  into\ncompliance  with  the  bedrock  obligations  imposed  by  the\nConstitution.   Thus,  the plaintiffs  would  argue that  the\nCommissioner's  and  the  Sheriff's  announced  intention  to\nabandon single-celling    a requirement of the consent decree\nbut  not  necessarily of  the  Constitution     is  enough to\ndemonstrate  that the  time is  not  yet ripe  to vacate  the\ndecree.   The Supreme Court's  decision in Rufo  itself lends\n                                               \nsome  support to  the plaintiffs'  position  in this  regard,\nwhere  the   issue  before   the  court   was  the   proposed\nmodification of a consent decree, a proposal that may well be\n            \nmade even when the ongoing constitutional violations have not\nbeen entirely extirpated.  See Rufo, 112 S. Ct. at 762-64.\n                                   \n\n9.  The  Commissioner asserts,  and there  appears  to be  no\ndispute,  that   the  Nashua  Street  Jail,   constructed  in\naccordance  with the  decree, presently  meets constitutional\nstandards and  has done so  since it  opened in May  of 1990.\nThe district court found that \"[t]he Nashua Street  [J]ail is\na modern, seven-story structure of steel, concrete, and brick\nconstruction.    It  provides conditions  of  confinement far\nsuperior to  those at the  former Charles Street  Jail, which\nhad  been determined  to be  below constitutionally  mandated\n\n                             -16-\n\nperiod  of time has  passed during which  such compliance has\n\nbeen achieved;10  and that it  is unlikely that  the original\n\nviolations   will  soon  be   resumed  if  the   decree  were\n\ndiscontinued.  Under  this standard (a view  we neither adopt\n\nnor reject), the  Commissioner on this record has  not made a\n\nshowing  adequate to oblige  the district court  to terminate\n\nthe decree.\n\n          Unlike   the    standard   just    described,   the\n\nCommissioner's  proposed  formula  for  vacating the  consent\n\ndecree     which we  find too restrictive  by any  measure   \n\nassumes  that  the  district court  is  obliged  to terminate\n\nwhenever the  existing constitutional  violation has  ceased.\n\nThis approach  gives insufficient  weight to  the problem  of\n\nrecurrence.   To  the  extent that  recurrence is  taken into\n\naccount,  the   Commissioner  brushes  the  issue   aside  by\n\nproclaiming  that the  Supreme  Court  has  made  clear  that\n\ndouble-celling is  not  a constitutional  violation even  for\n\npretrial  detainees.   There are  a  number of  flaws in  his\n\nanalysis.\n\n          We accept entirely the proposition, established  by\n\nthe Supreme  Court, that double-celling is  not automatically\n\n                    \n\nstandards.\"  Rufo, 148 F.R.D. at 17.\n                 \n\n10.  The consent decree was entered in 1979, and was modified\nin 1985.   The Commissioner's  motion to vacate was  filed in\nApril of 1992, nearly two  years after the Nashua Street Jail\nwas opened to receive prisoners.\n\n                             -17-\n\nunconstitutional  for  pretrial  detainees.     See  Bell  v.\n                                                         \n\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); see also Rhodes v. Chapman, 452\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 337  (1981) (similarly as to convicted  prisoners).  But\n\nthis  is  a  far  cry  from  the  implicit  position  of  the\n\nCommissioner that whatever double-celling may be contemplated\n\nby the Sheriff in the foreseeable future at the Nashua Street\n\nJail is therefore clearly constitutional.  We may assume that\n\nthe  housing of  two detainees  in a  cell providing  a large\n\namount  of  space,  with  appropriate  security  measures  to\n\nprotect against inmate assaults, would be constitutional; but\n\nwe  think it obviously  apparent that double-celling  in very\n\nsmall quarters, with  lack of security against  assaults, and\n\npossibly  other  threats  (e.g., disease)  could  violate due\n                               \n\nprocess.  And  it is far from  clear on the record  before us\n\nthat   the  immediate  plans  proposed  by  the  Sheriff  are\n\nconstitutional,  let  alone any  prospective next  steps that\n\nmight  follow from  the  complete  vacation  of  the  consent\n\ndecree.\n\n          Looking  only to the immediate future, we have here\n\na  prison facility that  was expressly constructed  under the\n\nconsent decree on the assumption that it would house only one\n\ndetainee per room  unit.  The size  and security arrangements\n\nwere specifically designed with that in mind, and  certain of\n\nthe \"amenities,\" such  as the  use of a  solid door with  the\n\nsmall peep hold  instead of bars, may increase  the risk that\n\n                             -18-\n\nassaults  on  inmates  would  go  undetected  (double-celling\n\nresumed).   Moreover,  the  rooms just  meet  the minima  for\n\nsingle occupancy  that  are recommended  by standard  setting\n\nagencies.11  The  district court also made  findings that the\n\nrisk  of tuberculosis spreading  in these close  quarters, if\n\ndouble-celling  were permitted,  is a  factor  of importance.\n\nThis  is not to  say that the  Sheriff's double-celling plans\n\nfor the Nashua Street Jail,  or others that are proposed, may\n\nnot yet be found constitutional.   We say merely that whether\n\nthey  will be constitutional  remains currently  undecided   \n\nand the answer is pivotal to whether vacating the decree will\n\nresult  in a recurrence of unconstitutional conditions, given\n\nthat  both  the  Commissioner and  Sheriff  are  committed to\n\ndouble-celling unless otherwise ordered. \n\n          Other longer term prospects  of vacating the decree\n\nalso give us pause.  Even if the district court were  to find\n\nthat  modification  of  the decree  to  accept  the Sheriff's\n\n                    \n\n11.  The court below found that:\n\n          The  present cells  in the Nashua  Street Jail\n     were explicitly designed for single-bunking.   They\n     are slightly smaller in area than the  cells in the\n     old Charles Street  facility.  The  contemporaneous\n     views  of expert  consultants  who participated  in\n     recommendations  for design  of  the Nashua  Street\n     facility  were   that  cells  of  this   size  were\n     acceptable  only because they were meant for single\n     occupancy.\n\nRufo, 148 R.F.D. at 21; see also  Rufo, 112 S. Ct. at 755 n.3\n                                      \n(listing state and national design standards).\n\n                             -19-\n\nproposed   double-celling  arrangements   in  certain   cells\n\nsatisfies  constitutional minimums, it  is by no  means clear\n\nthat  the district  court would  also find  that there  is no\n\nlikelihood that unconstitutional crowding would occur if  the\n\ndecree were  entirely terminated.   As we have said,  even on\n\nthe reading  of the law  that we think most  favorable to the\n\nCommissioner, the district  court would hardly be  obliged to\n\nterminate  the decree  if it  had substantial reason  to fear\n\nthat the constitutional  conditions would  be recreated  soon\n\nafter judicial oversight had been eliminated.\n\n          It  is  a  notorious  fact  that  prisons  are  now\n\ndesperately  crowded and that the willingness of legislatures\n\nto  fund  new  prison construction  is  limited  by competing\n\nsocial  needs  and  public  resistance  to  increased  taxes.\n\nWithout  knowing far more than  this record reveals about the\n\nlikelihood that the Sheriff would  be in a position to resist\n\nsuch unconstitutional overcrowding, it is hardly  possible to\n\nmake a clear determination that the  Dowell standard could be\n                                           \n\nsatisfied in this case.\n\n          One further consideration bears  on our sense  that\n\nthe district court was entitled,  at this stage, not to order\n\ntermination of the decree.  The district court did not wholly\n\nforeclose the possibility of double-celling; to the contrary,\n\nit invited the Sheriff, who is not a party to this appeal, to\n\nmake a further showing with respect to his own double-celling\n\n                             -20-\n\nplans and alternatives  to them.  The Sheriff  has made clear\n\nthat  he intends  to do  so.12   It appears  certain  that in\n\nsuch a proceeding  further light would be cast  on the impact\n\nof the Sheriff's proposal on  the lives and conditions of the\n\ndetainees.\n\n          It  seems to  us  that,  where  the  constitutional\n\nstatus of the proposal is uncertain, the district court could\n\nreasonably  consider  first  the   lesser  remedy  of  decree\n\nmodification before definitively deciding  whether the decree\n\nshould  be  irreversibly  terminated.    A  decision  by  the\n\ndistrict court to allow some double-celling might satisfy the\n\nCommissioner despite  his doctrinal  objections to  continued\n\ncourt supervision; but far more important, the district court\n\ncould conclude     on  a more careful  look at  the Sheriff's\n\nembellished    proposal         that    it    would   produce\n\nunconstitutional conditions, a  conclusion that would provide\n                \n\nan  a fortiori  basis for  refusing to terminate  the decree.\n              \n\nAfter all, if the Sheriff by his own admission is planning to\n\nintroduce  changes that the district court finds recreate the\n\nunconstitutional crowding  violation, then one can hardly say\n\nthat future violations are unlikely.\n\n                    \n\n12.  The  Commissioner is  involved  in this  litigation  not\nbecause  he  manages  the Nashua  Street  Jail  (that is  the\nSheriff's responsibility),  but because  he  must assist  the\nSheriff in lodging  surplus pretrial detainees who  cannot be\naccommodated at the  Nashua Street Jail.  See  Inmates of the\n                                                             \nSuffolk County  Jail v. Eisenstadt,  494 F.2d 1196  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n1974).\n\n                             -21-\n\n          We recognize that the  district court's reasons for\n\nrefusing  to  terminate  may  be  based on  a  reading  of  a\n\ngoverning  law  that  is quite  different  from  the arguendo\n                                                             \n\nposition we  have described  as the  most favorable  that the\n\nCommissioner could achieve.  It could have been  the district\n\ncourt's view that the termination was improper merely because\n\nit would frustrate an important object of the original decree\n\n    single-celling    or  because the kind  of considerations\n\npertinent to decree modification (e.g.,  exploration of other\n                                      \n\nalternatives,  financial stringency) have  not been  shown to\n\nfavor the Commissioner.   Still, we see no  reason to grapple\n\neither with these matters or with related unsettled questions\n\nof governing law where, as here, the immediate outcome in the\n\nongoing case  appears to  us correct and  the issues  that we\n\nleave  to another day are  difficult ones not clearly settled\n\nby Supreme Court precedent.\n\n          Accordingly, whatever  the district court  may have\n\nintended,  our affirmance of the court's refusal to terminate\n\nrests  upon  and is  limited  to  the  grounds we  have  just\n\ndiscussed:   first,  the  absence of  an  adequate record  to\n\njustify  a complete  decree termination  at  this time;  and,\n\nsecond,  the   prospect  of  further  proceedings   in  which\n\nadditional  light may  be shed,  not  only on  the basis  for\n\ndecree modification  but also  on issues  that would  clearly\n\nbear upon the decree's termination.   On this basis, and with\n\n                             -22-\n\nthese  clarifications, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n          So ordered.\n                    \n\n                             -23-\n",

Thereafter, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, 498 U.S. 1081, 111 S.Ct. 950, 112 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1991), and, after hearing, vacated the decision below and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.  Rufo, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 765.   The Supreme Court ruled that the district court had erred in applying the rigid \"grievous wrong\" standard of United States v. Swift to the Sheriff's motion to modify the consent decree.  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 757-58 (holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) does not intend that \"modifications of consent decrees in all cases [are] to be governed by the standard actually applied in Swift ... [but rather] permits a less stringent, more flexible standard\").  The Court observed that \"[t]he experience of the district and circuit courts in implementing and modifying such decrees has demonstrated that a flexible approach is often essential to achieving the goals of [institutional] reform litigation.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 758.   Against this backdrop, the Court held that \"a party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the [initial] burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 760.   To meet this initial burden, a party seeking modification of an institutional reform consent decree may show \"either a significant change in factual conditions or in law.\"  Id.  Once the party seeking modification meets this standard, \"the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court reconsidered the Sheriff's motion to modify the consent decree to permit the double-bunking of inmates in 197 of the 322 regular male housing cells at the Nashua Street Jail.  The court also considered two other motions filed after the case was remanded, one of which was the Commissioner's present motion to vacate the consent decree altogether.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See Rufo, 148 F.R.D. at 15.

According to the district court, the Sheriff had not \"made [a] showing of reasoned exploration of other feasible alternatives that would maintain rather than impair the integrity of the consent decree.\"  Id.  Nevertheless, the district court ruled that, \"[t]hough [it] ha[d] rejected the Sheriff's request to double-bunk, ... it does not follow that no acceptable alternative could be fashioned for a modified use of the Nashua Street facility in a way that would meet the objectives of the consent decree, including protection against abuse and undue risk of contagion.\"  Id.  Therefore, the district court did \"not foreclose consideration of another proposal submitted promptly, with evidentiary support that justifies a finding that it is suitably tailored to changes in circumstances, beyond the control of the defendants after due effort, from the circumstances existing when the decree was entered (or from circumstances existing when it was modified).\"  Id.  The Sheriff appealed from the district court's denial of his two motions, but agreed to stay his appeal pending further proceedings on a new motion to modify filed in the district court.  We were told at argument that proceedings regarding this motion are in progress in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining its denial of the Commissioner's separate motion to vacate the consent decree, the district court began by stating that the Commissioner did not support the Sheriff's proposal for modification because the Commissioner felt that \"the plan would require unnecessary judicial involvement in the day-to-day administration of the jail.\"  Id. at 23.   The district court noted that the Commissioner objected to being forced by orders in this case to accept from the Sheriff the overflow from the Nashua Street Jail.  The district court went on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than submitting his own plan for modification, ... the Commissioner challenges the consent decree and this court's jurisdiction over the case, arguing that it is no longer equitable for the consent decree to have prospective effect....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's proposed way of avoiding undue involvement of the court in day-to-day implementation of the consent decree is an unacceptable extreme--simply let the Sheriff have unfettered discretion to order double-bunking without any constraints or limitations as to criteria regarding associated conditions of confinement.  The Commissioner contends not only that the court should not require that single-bunking be maintained but also that the court should not require that any other safeguards be instituted in lieu of single-bunking to carry out the objectives of the decree as fashioned by consent.  This hard-line approach is plainly incompatible with this court's obligation, under the order of remand, to consider whether any proposed modification of the consent decree is suitably tailored to changed circumstances.  The Commissioner of Corrections' position must be rejected.  His motion, accordingly, is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Commissioner argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when ruling on his motion to vacate the consent decree.  The Commissioner asserts that the district court mistakenly applied the Supreme Court's Rufo standard, which he says relates only to motions to modify, not to vacate, institutional reform consent decrees.  According to the Commissioner, a district court that rules upon a motion to vacate an institutional reform consent decree must consider only whether the defendants are in present compliance with constitutional requirements and whether the effects of the original violation have abated.  Maintaining that these conditions have been met, the Commissioner contends that the district court erred in refusing to vacate the decree, and he seeks a remand so that the court can reconsider the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the Commissioner that motions to vacate consent decrees and motions to modify them involve somewhat different analytical frameworks, we find the Commissioner's proposed standard inadequate.  We also think that, whatever the weaknesses of its stated rationale, the lower court properly declined to vacate the consent decree under the present circumstances and at the present time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, \"[w]e note that [describing] the appropriate legal standard [to be applied by district courts to motions to vacate institutional reform consent decrees] presents a pure question of law, subject to de novo review.\"  Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v.

Moreover, even should we find that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard to the Commissioner's motion to vacate the consent decree, we may, in appropriate circumstances, affirm the district court's denial of the Commissioner's motion if we are satisfied that the district court's decision was correct.  See, e.g., Knight v. Mills, 836 F.2d 659, 661 n. 3 (1st Cir.1987) (\"It is proper for an appellate court to affirm a correct decision of a lower court even when that decision is based on an inappropriate ground.\"  (emphasis in original)).  In determining the propriety of the district court's decision, we may affirm on any independently sufficient ground supported by the record, see Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 704 (1st Cir.1991), and we review the district court's resolution of mixed questions of law and fact under a clearly erroneous standard, United States v. Rule Indus., 878 F.2d 535, 542 n. 7 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Board of Education v.

Pitts, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992), the United States Supreme Court described the standard for district courts to apply when deciding whether to dissolve injunctive orders previously entered in school desegregation cases.  While the desegregation cases have a special history and context all their own, many of the same considerations would appear to be relevant to other types of institutional reform litigation.  This circuit has cited to Dowell 's principles in cases involving consent decrees pertaining to conditions at correctional facilities and to the treatment of mentally ill or retarded persons.

Glover, 989 F.2d 65 (1st Cir.1993) (Consumer Advisory Board and a group of residents and outpatients of Pineland Center, a state institution for the mentally retarded, brought action on behalf of Center residents and outpatients against the Commissioner of Mental Health and other state officials, seeking enforcement of rights created under a 1978 consent decree).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dowell, the Supreme Court stated that desegregation decrees should not exist forever.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. at 637 (\"[I]njunctions entered in school desegregation cases ... are not intended to operate in perpetuity.\").  This circuit has invoked this principle in other kinds of institutional reform cases.  See Pearson, 990 F.2d at 658 (\"In institutional reform litigation, injunctions should not operate inviolate in perpetuity.\");  Glover, 989 F.2d at 68 (\"[I]nstitutional reform decrees need not endure forever.\").  In all types of institutional reform litigation, federalism concerns dictate that any \"intrusion by a federal court into the affairs of local government should be kept to a bare minimum and not be allowed to continue after the violation has abated and its pernicious effects have been cured.\"  Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1276 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1043, 122 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 636, 637-38, as supplemented by Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1446, the Supreme Court indicated that there are two conditions that must be met before a district court is essentially obliged to terminate a litigated decree and return the institution or programs under court supervision to the governance of state or local authorities.  First, the district court must determine that the underlying constitutional wrong has been remedied, either fully or to the full extent now deemed practicable.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 636, 637-38;  Glover, 989 F.2d at 69.   Second, there must be a determination that the authorities have complied with the decree in good faith for a reasonable period of time since it was entered.  See Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1446;  Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 637-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in these requirements is the need for the district court, before terminating the decree entirely, to be satisfied that there is relatively little or no likelihood that the original constitutional violation will promptly be repeated when the decree is lifted.   See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636-37 (\"[A] finding ... that the Oklahoma City School District was being operated in compliance with the commands of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully achieved.\"  (emphasis added)).  Whether authorities are likely to return to former ways once the decree is dissolved may be assessed by considering \"[t]he defendants' past record of compliance and their present attitudes toward the reforms mandated by the decree.\"   Lloyd C. Anderson, Release and Resumption of Jurisdiction Over Consent Decrees in Structural Reform Litigation, 42 U.Miami L.Rev. 401, 411 (1987) (citing  Morgan v. McDonough, 689 F.2d 265, 280 (1st Cir.1982)).  Of possible further relevance is the way that demographic, economic, and political forces may be expected to influence local authorities and the institution once the shelter of the decree has been lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, there can be no perfect certainty that the original constitutional violation will not be repeated.  No one can demand such an assurance too far into the future.  But it would be a travesty of the two requirements just stated--that the violation be eliminated and that the officials have shown their commitment to obey the law--if a decree could be terminated in the face of substantial evidence that the same underlying violation would then be resumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These general statements leave many questions unanswered.  One, as already mentioned, is the extent to which they can be extended from the school desegregation cases, in which the statements were made, to all other institutional reform decrees including those involving prisons.  Our tentative view, as said, is that they probably can be so extended, although the point need not be decided definitively.  Another question, perhaps more perplexing, is whether there ought to be any difference in treatment between a litigated decree and a consent decree when it comes to standards for termination;  arguments can be made on both sides and, again, we need not definitely resolve the question.  Finally, there is the question of whether and to what extent the \"extra\" remedial protections of the decree, at least if embodied in a bargained-for consent decree, ought to remain relevant when the underlying federal violations have entirely ceased and are not likely to recur.  As with the others, there are plausible arguments on both sides of this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need, however, to resolve these issues at this time.  For purposes of the present appeal, it is enough to assume arguendo that the proper standard for decree termination is the one most favorable to the Commissioner that we can imagine being adopted by the Supreme Court.  On this view of the law, the Commissioner would arguably be entitled to termination of the decree if the Commissioner could show:  that the federal violations of the type that provoked the original action have been entirely remedied or remedied to the full extent feasible;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  that a reasonable period of time has passed during which such compliance has been achieved;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  and that it is unlikely that the original violations will soon be resumed if the decree were discontinued.  Under this standard (a view we neither adopt nor reject), the Commissioner on this record has not made a showing adequate to oblige the district court to terminate the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the standard just described, the Commissioner's proposed formula for vacating the consent decree--which we find too restrictive by any measure--assumes that the district court is obliged to terminate whenever the existing constitutional violation has ceased.  This approach gives insufficient weight to the problem of recurrence.  To the extent that recurrence is taken into account, the Commissioner brushes the issue aside by proclaiming that the Supreme Court has made clear that double-celling is not a constitutional violation even for pretrial detainees.  There are a number of flaws in his analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept entirely the proposition, established by the Supreme Court that double-celling is not automatically unconstitutional for pretrial detainees.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979);  see also Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (similarly as to convicted prisoners).  But this is a far cry from the implicit position of the Commissioner that whatever double-celling may be contemplated by the Sheriff in the foreseeable future at the Nashua Street Jail is therefore clearly constitutional.  We may assume that the housing of two detainees in a cell providing a large amount of space, with appropriate security measures to protect against inmate assaults, would be constitutional;  but we think it obviously apparent that double-celling in very small quarters, with lack of security against assaults and possibly other threats (e.g., disease), could violate due process.  And it is far from clear on the record before us that the immediate plans proposed by the Sheriff are constitutional, let alone any prospective next steps that might follow from the complete vacation of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking only to the immediate future, we have here a prison facility that was expressly constructed under the consent decree on the assumption that it would house only one detainee per room unit.  The size and security arrangements were specifically designed with that in mind, and certain of the \"amenities,\" such as the use of a solid door with the small peep hold instead of bars, may increase the risk that assaults on inmates would go undetected (double-celling resumed).  Moreover, the rooms just meet the minima for single occupancy that are recommended by standard setting agencies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The district court also made findings that the risk of tuberculosis spreading in these close quarters, if double-celling were permitted, is a factor of importance.  This is not to say that the Sheriff's double-celling plans for the Nashua Street Jail, or others that are proposed, may not yet be found constitutional.  We say merely that whether they will be constitutional remains currently undecided--and the answer is pivotal to whether vacating the decree will result in a recurrence of unconstitutional conditions, given that both the Commissioner and Sheriff are committed to double-celling unless otherwise ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other longer term prospects of vacating the decree also give us pause.  Even if the district court were to find that modification of the decree to accept the Sheriff's proposed double-celling arrangements in certain cells satisfies constitutional minimums, it is by no means clear that the district court would also find that there is no likelihood that unconstitutional crowding would occur if the decree were entirely terminated.  As we have said, even on the reading of the law that we think most favorable to the Commissioner, the district court would hardly be obliged to terminate the decree if it had substantial reason to fear that the constitutional conditions would be recreated soon after judicial oversight had been eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a notorious fact that prisons are now desperately crowded and that the willingness of legislatures to fund new prison construction is limited by competing social needs and public resistance to increased taxes.  Without knowing far more than this record reveals about the likelihood that the Sheriff would be in a position to resist such unconstitutional overcrowding, it is hardly possible to make a clear determination that the Dowell standard could be satisfied in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One further consideration bears on our sense that the district court was entitled, at this stage, not to order termination of the decree.  The district court did not wholly foreclose the possibility of double-celling;  to the contrary, it invited the Sheriff, who is not a party to this appeal, to make a further showing with respect to his own double-celling plans and alternatives to them.  The Sheriff has made clear that he intends to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  It appears certain that in such a proceeding further light would be cast on the impact of the Sheriff's proposal on the lives and conditions of the detainees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that, where the constitutional status of the proposal is uncertain, the district court could reasonably consider first the lesser remedy of decree modification before definitively deciding whether the decree should be irreversibly terminated.  A decision by the district court to allow some double-celling might satisfy the Commissioner despite his doctrinal objections to continued court supervision;  but far more important, the district court could conclude--on a more careful look at the Sheriff's embellished proposal--that it would produce unconstitutional conditions, a conclusion that would provide an a fortiori basis for refusing to terminate the decree.  After all, if the Sheriff by his own admission is planning to introduce changes that the district court finds recreate the unconstitutional crowding violation, then one can hardly say that future violations are unlikely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the district court's reasons for refusing to terminate may be based on a reading of a governing law that is quite different from the arguendo position we have described as the most favorable that the Commissioner could achieve.  It could have been the district court's view that the termination was improper merely because it would frustrate an important object of the original decree--single-celling--or because the kind of considerations pertinent to decree modification (e.g., exploration of other alternatives, financial stringency) have not been shown to favor the Commissioner.  Still, we see no reason to grapple either with these matters or with related unsettled questions of governing law where, as here, the immediate outcome in the ongoing case appears to us correct and the issues that we leave to another day are difficult ones not clearly settled by Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, whatever the district court may have intended, our affirmance of the court's refusal to terminate rests upon and is limited to the grounds we have just discussed:  first, the absence of an adequate record to justify a complete decree termination at this time;  and, second, the prospect of further proceedings in which additional light may be shed, not only on the basis for decree modification but also on issues that would clearly bear upon the decree's termination.  On this basis, and with these clarifications, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>In the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, et al., Plaintiffs,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>v.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Dennis J.

Once the party seeking modification meets this standard, \"the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court reconsidered the Sheriff's motion to modify the consent decree to permit the double-bunking of inmates in 197 of the 322 regular male housing cells at the Nashua Street Jail.  The court also considered two other motions filed after the case was remanded, one of which was the Commissioner's present motion to vacate the consent decree altogether.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See Rufo, 148 F.R.D. at 15.   The district court denied all three motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court explained its denial of the Sheriff's motion for modification to allow double-bunking of pretrial detainees at the Nashua Street Jail in a comprehensive opinion, concluding that \"the Sheriff's proposed modification [was] not suitably tailored to changed circumstances shown by the record.\"  Id. at 24.   According to the district court, the Sheriff had not \"made [a] showing of reasoned exploration of other feasible alternatives that would maintain rather than impair the integrity of the consent decree.\"  Id.  Nevertheless, the district court ruled that, \"[t]hough [it] ha[d] rejected the Sheriff's request to double-bunk, ... it does not follow that no acceptable alternative could be fashioned for a modified use of the Nashua Street facility in a way that would meet the objectives of the consent decree, including protection against abuse and undue risk of contagion.\"  Id.  Therefore, the district court did \"not foreclose consideration of another proposal submitted promptly, with evidentiary support that justifies a finding that it is suitably tailored to changes in circumstances, beyond the control of the defendants after due effort, from the circumstances existing when the decree was entered (or from circumstances existing when it was modified).\"  Id.  The Sheriff appealed from the district court's denial of his two motions, but agreed to stay his appeal pending further proceedings on a new motion to modify filed in the district court.  We were told at argument that proceedings regarding this motion are in progress in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining its denial of the Commissioner's separate motion to vacate the consent decree, the district court began by stating that the Commissioner did not support the Sheriff's proposal for modification because the Commissioner felt that \"the plan would require unnecessary judicial involvement in the day-to-day administration of the jail.\"  Id. at 23.   The district court noted that the Commissioner objected to being forced by orders in this case to accept from the Sheriff the overflow from the Nashua Street Jail.  The district court went on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than submitting his own plan for modification, ... the Commissioner challenges the consent decree and this court's jurisdiction over the case, arguing that it is no longer equitable for the consent decree to have prospective effect....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's proposed way of avoiding undue involvement of the court in day-to-day implementation of the consent decree is an unacceptable extreme--simply let the Sheriff have unfettered discretion to order double-bunking without any constraints or limitations as to criteria regarding associated conditions of confinement.  The Commissioner contends not only that the court should not require that single-bunking be maintained but also that the court should not require that any other safeguards be instituted in lieu of single-bunking to carry out the objectives of the decree as fashioned by consent.  This hard-line approach is plainly incompatible with this court's obligation, under the order of remand, to consider whether any proposed modification of the consent decree is suitably tailored to changed circumstances.  The Commissioner of Corrections' position must be rejected.  His motion, accordingly, is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Commissioner argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when ruling on his motion to vacate the consent decree.  The Commissioner asserts that the district court mistakenly applied the Supreme Court's Rufo standard, which he says relates only to motions to modify, not to vacate, institutional reform consent decrees.  According to the Commissioner, a district court that rules upon a motion to vacate an institutional reform consent decree must consider only whether the defendants are in present compliance with constitutional requirements and whether the effects of the original violation have abated.  Maintaining that these conditions have been met, the Commissioner contends that the district court erred in refusing to vacate the decree, and he seeks a remand so that the court can reconsider the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the Commissioner that motions to vacate consent decrees and motions to modify them involve somewhat different analytical frameworks, we find the Commissioner's proposed standard inadequate.

First, the district court must determine that the underlying constitutional wrong has been remedied, either fully or to the full extent now deemed practicable.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 636, 637-38;  Glover, 989 F.2d at 69.   Second, there must be a determination that the authorities have complied with the decree in good faith for a reasonable period of time since it was entered.  See Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1446;  Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 637-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in these requirements is the need for the district court, before terminating the decree entirely, to be satisfied that there is relatively little or no likelihood that the original constitutional violation will promptly be repeated when the decree is lifted.   See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636-37 (\"[A] finding ... that the Oklahoma City School District was being operated in compliance with the commands of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully achieved.\"  (emphasis added)).  Whether authorities are likely to return to former ways once the decree is dissolved may be assessed by considering \"[t]he defendants' past record of compliance and their present attitudes toward the reforms mandated by the decree.\"   Lloyd C. Anderson, Release and Resumption of Jurisdiction Over Consent Decrees in Structural Reform Litigation, 42 U.Miami L.Rev. 401, 411 (1987) (citing  Morgan v.

Of possible further relevance is the way that demographic, economic, and political forces may be expected to influence local authorities and the institution once the shelter of the decree has been lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, there can be no perfect certainty that the original constitutional violation will not be repeated.  No one can demand such an assurance too far into the future.  But it would be a travesty of the two requirements just stated--that the violation be eliminated and that the officials have shown their commitment to obey the law--if a decree could be terminated in the face of substantial evidence that the same underlying violation would then be resumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These general statements leave many questions unanswered.  One, as already mentioned, is the extent to which they can be extended from the school desegregation cases, in which the statements were made, to all other institutional reform decrees including those involving prisons.  Our tentative view, as said, is that they probably can be so extended, although the point need not be decided definitively.  Another question, perhaps more perplexing, is whether there ought to be any difference in treatment between a litigated decree and a consent decree when it comes to standards for termination;  arguments can be made on both sides and, again, we need not definitely resolve the question.  Finally, there is the question of whether and to what extent the \"extra\" remedial protections of the decree, at least if embodied in a bargained-for consent decree, ought to remain relevant when the underlying federal violations have entirely ceased and are not likely to recur.  As with the others, there are plausible arguments on both sides of this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need, however, to resolve these issues at this time.  For purposes of the present appeal, it is enough to assume arguendo that the proper standard for decree termination is the one most favorable to the Commissioner that we can imagine being adopted by the Supreme Court.  On this view of the law, the Commissioner would arguably be entitled to termination of the decree if the Commissioner could show:  that the federal violations of the type that provoked the original action have been entirely remedied or remedied to the full extent feasible;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  that a reasonable period of time has passed during which such compliance has been achieved;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  and that it is unlikely that the original violations will soon be resumed if the decree were discontinued.  Under this standard (a view we neither adopt nor reject), the Commissioner on this record has not made a showing adequate to oblige the district court to terminate the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the standard just described, the Commissioner's proposed formula for vacating the consent decree--which we find too restrictive by any measure--assumes that the district court is obliged to terminate whenever the existing constitutional violation has ceased.  This approach gives insufficient weight to the problem of recurrence.  To the extent that recurrence is taken into account, the Commissioner brushes the issue aside by proclaiming that the Supreme Court has made clear that double-celling is not a constitutional violation even for pretrial detainees.  There are a number of flaws in his analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept entirely the proposition, established by the Supreme Court that double-celling is not automatically unconstitutional for pretrial detainees.  See Bell v. Wolfish, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (1981) (similarly as to convicted prisoners).  But this is a far cry from the implicit position of the Commissioner that whatever double-celling may be contemplated by the Sheriff in the foreseeable future at the Nashua Street Jail is therefore clearly constitutional.  We may assume that the housing of two detainees in a cell providing a large amount of space, with appropriate security measures to protect against inmate assaults, would be constitutional;  but we think it obviously apparent that double-celling in very small quarters, with lack of security against assaults and possibly other threats (e.g., disease), could violate due process.  And it is far from clear on the record before us that the immediate plans proposed by the Sheriff are constitutional, let alone any prospective next steps that might follow from the complete vacation of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking only to the immediate future, we have here a prison facility that was expressly constructed under the consent decree on the assumption that it would house only one detainee per room unit.  The size and security arrangements were specifically designed with that in mind, and certain of the \"amenities,\" such as the use of a solid door with the small peep hold instead of bars, may increase the risk that assaults on inmates would go undetected (double-celling resumed).  Moreover, the rooms just meet the minima for single occupancy that are recommended by standard setting agencies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The district court also made findings that the risk of tuberculosis spreading in these close quarters, if double-celling were permitted, is a factor of importance.  This is not to say that the Sheriff's double-celling plans for the Nashua Street Jail, or others that are proposed, may not yet be found constitutional.  We say merely that whether they will be constitutional remains currently undecided--and the answer is pivotal to whether vacating the decree will result in a recurrence of unconstitutional conditions, given that both the Commissioner and Sheriff are committed to double-celling unless otherwise ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other longer term prospects of vacating the decree also give us pause.  Even if the district court were to find that modification of the decree to accept the Sheriff's proposed double-celling arrangements in certain cells satisfies constitutional minimums, it is by no means clear that the district court would also find that there is no likelihood that unconstitutional crowding would occur if the decree were entirely terminated.  As we have said, even on the reading of the law that we think most favorable to the Commissioner, the district court would hardly be obliged to terminate the decree if it had substantial reason to fear that the constitutional conditions would be recreated soon after judicial oversight had been eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a notorious fact that prisons are now desperately crowded and that the willingness of legislatures to fund new prison construction is limited by competing social needs and public resistance to increased taxes.  Without knowing far more than this record reveals about the likelihood that the Sheriff would be in a position to resist such unconstitutional overcrowding, it is hardly possible to make a clear determination that the Dowell standard could be satisfied in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One further consideration bears on our sense that the district court was entitled, at this stage, not to order termination of the decree.  The district court did not wholly foreclose the possibility of double-celling;  to the contrary, it invited the Sheriff, who is not a party to this appeal, to make a further showing with respect to his own double-celling plans and alternatives to them.  The Sheriff has made clear that he intends to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  It appears certain that in such a proceeding further light would be cast on the impact of the Sheriff's proposal on the lives and conditions of the detainees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that, where the constitutional status of the proposal is uncertain, the district court could reasonably consider first the lesser remedy of decree modification before definitively deciding whether the decree should be irreversibly terminated.  A decision by the district court to allow some double-celling might satisfy the Commissioner despite his doctrinal objections to continued court supervision;  but far more important, the district court could conclude--on a more careful look at the Sheriff's embellished proposal--that it would produce unconstitutional conditions, a conclusion that would provide an a fortiori basis for refusing to terminate the decree.  After all, if the Sheriff by his own admission is planning to introduce changes that the district court finds recreate the unconstitutional crowding violation, then one can hardly say that future violations are unlikely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the district court's reasons for refusing to terminate may be based on a reading of a governing law that is quite different from the arguendo position we have described as the most favorable that the Commissioner could achieve.  It could have been the district court's view that the termination was improper merely because it would frustrate an important object of the original decree--single-celling--or because the kind of considerations pertinent to decree modification (e.g., exploration of other alternatives, financial stringency) have not been shown to favor the Commissioner.  Still, we see no reason to grapple either with these matters or with related unsettled questions of governing law where, as here, the immediate outcome in the ongoing case appears to us correct and the issues that we leave to another day are difficult ones not clearly settled by Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, whatever the district court may have intended, our affirmance of the court's refusal to terminate rests upon and is limited to the grounds we have just discussed:  first, the absence of an adequate record to justify a complete decree termination at this time;  and, second, the prospect of further proceedings in which additional light may be shed, not only on the basis for decree modification but also on issues that would clearly bear upon the decree's termination.  On this basis, and with these clarifications, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>In the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, et al., Plaintiffs,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>v.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Dennis J.
