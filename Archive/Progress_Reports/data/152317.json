Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n           Howard, Selya and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Randy Gioia, by appointment of the court, with whom Elizabeth\nBillowitz and Law Office of Randy Gioia were on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Annette C. Benedetto, Assistant Attorney General, Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 5, 2010\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This case presents a question of\n\nfirst impression in this circuit: Can mental illness equitably toll\n\nthe one-year statute of limitations for the filing of a state\n\nprisoner's habeas petition contained in the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective    Death    Penalty    Act   of    1996    (AEDPA),    28   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)?      We hold that the district court correctly answered\n\nthis question in the affirmative.           We nonetheless hold that the\n\ndistrict court's further determination that the petitioner was not\n\nentitled to equitable tolling rests on too unsteady a foundation.\n\nConsequently, we vacate the order dismissing the habeas petition\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            This case is fact-intensive, so we take pains to mine the\n\nrecord and recite the relevant background in some detail.               The\n\nfacts themselves are largely undisputed (although they support\n\nconflicting inferences).\n\n            The petitioner, James Riva, II, suffers from paranoid\n\nschizophrenia.     His history of severe mental illness dates back to\n\nhis    adolescence.      His    condition    has    required    intermittent\n\nhospitalization since 1974.\n\n            On April 10, 1980, the petitioner killed his grandmother\n\nwhile under a paranoid delusion that, if he did not, he would fall\n\nprey to a society of vampires.         He was found competent to stand\n\ntrial in state court and, on October 30, 1981, a jury convicted him\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof second-degree murder, arson, and assault and battery on a police\n\nofficer.    The trial justice sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\n            Four    days    later,   the    petitioner      was   committed    to\n\nBridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater), where he remained until\n\nJanuary 24, 1989.     At that point, he was transferred to the general\n\nprison population.         His stay there was short-lived; he was sent\n\nback to Bridgewater on September 6, 1990, after he assaulted a\n\ncorrectional officer while under a paranoid delusion that the\n\nofficer had been draining fluid from the petitioner's spine.                  The\n\npetitioner was charged criminally for the assault, but was found\n\nnot guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n            The petitioner remained at Bridgewater until August of\n\n1999.      During   this    interlude,     he   attempted   to    challenge   his\n\nconvictions in both state and federal courts.               His trial counsel,\n\nJohn Spinale, filed a timely notice of appeal and motions for new\n\ntrial and to revise or revoke the sentence.                 The trial justice\n\ndenied the latter two motions, and Spinale withdrew as counsel.\n\nAttorney Willie Davis handled the appeal.                   The Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court (MAC) affirmed both the convictions and the denial of\n\nthe motion for new trial.        Commonwealth v. Riva, 469 N.E.2d 1307,\n\n1312 (Mass. App. Ct. 1984).              On January 4, 1985, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) denied the petitioner's application for leave\n\nto obtain further appellate review (ALOFAR). Commonwealth v. Riva,\n\n474 N.E.2d 181 (Mass. 1985) (table).\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          In    1987   the   petitioner,   acting    pro   se,   filed   an\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district\n\ncourt.   The court dismissed the application on the ground that it\n\ncontained unexhausted claims.     We affirmed.      Riva v. Getchell, 873\n\nF.2d 1434 (1st Cir. 1989) (table).\n\n          On June 2, 1988, the petitioner, again acting pro se,\n\nfiled a second motion for new trial.         The state superior court\n\nappointed Dana Alan Curhan as counsel.        Curhan filed an amended\n\nmotion for new trial or post-conviction relief. The superior court\n\ndenied the amended motion.     The petitioner's counselled appeal was\n\nunsuccessful, Commonwealth v. Riva, 615 N.E.2d 606 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1993) (table), and the SJC refused to grant an ALOFAR, Commonwealth\n\nv. Riva, 618 N.E.2d 1364 (Mass. 1993) (table).\n\n          Although Curhan's representation ended at that juncture,\n\nthe petitioner was undaunted.     On August 2, 1993, he filed a pro se\n\nmotion to revise or revoke his sentence.            His newly appointed\n\ncounsel, Richard Passalacqua, filed a third motion for new trial on\n\nMay 11, 1995.   The superior court denied this motion approximately\n\nthree months later, and Passalacqua withdrew as counsel.\n\n          The petitioner appealed pro se, but the MAC eventually\n\ndismissed the appeal for want of prosecution. On October 28, 1996,\n\nthe superior court denied the petitioner's pro se motion to revise\n\nor revoke his sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f              Meanwhile, the petitioner was attacking on a second\n\nfront.    On February 1, 1996, he repaired to the federal district\n\ncourt and filed another pro se application for habeas relief.               The\n\ndistrict court originally dismissed this case for insufficiency of\n\nservice of process but later reopened it.              The reopening came to\n\nnaught, as the petitioner, apparently concerned about exhaustion,\n\nmoved for a voluntary dismissal on November 25, 1996.            See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 41(a).      The district court granted that motion.             Riva v.\n\nDuBois, No. 96-10273 (D. Mass. Feb. 21, 1997) (unpublished order).\n\n              The petitioner's father hired Barbara Smith as counsel to\n\nprepare   a    third   federal   habeas    petition.     Smith   died    before\n\ncompleting the task, but on January 6, 1998, her law firm filed the\n\nhabeas petition (quite possibly without the petitioner's consent).\n\nBecause no authorization had been obtained to file a successive\n\nhabeas petition, the district court transferred the case to this\n\ncourt.1   We dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute.              Riva\n\nv. Nelson, No. 99-1071 (1st Cir. Oct. 28, 1999) (unpublished\n\norder).\n\n              On March 17, 1999, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed\n\na fourth new trial motion.        The superior court denied this motion\n\n\n\n     1\n       This order was improvident.    Both prior habeas petitions\nwere dismissed for want of exhaustion.        Because neither was\nadjudicated on the merits, the third petition was not \"successive\"\nwithin the meaning of the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b). See\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 487 (2000); Pratt v. United\nStates, 129 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fon December 13, 1999.      The MAC affirmed that order, Commonwealth v.\n\nRiva, 752 N.E.2d 242 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001) (table), and the SJC\n\ndenied an ALOFAR, Commonwealth v. Riva, 752 N.E.2d 240 (Mass. 2001)\n\n(table).\n\n            On October 15, 2001, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed\n\nthe habeas petition with which we are concerned. The district court\n\nappointed counsel and ultimately dismissed the petition as untimely.\n\nRiva v. Ficco, No. 01-12061, 2007 WL 954771, at *6 (D. Mass. Mar.\n\n28, 2007). The court held that the AEDPA statute of limitations was\n\nnot tolled on the basis of the petitioner's mental illness.                Id.\n\nIt reasoned that the petitioner's prolific filings in both state and\n\nfederal courts demonstrated a capacity to comply with the filing\n\ndeadline.    Id. at *5.     The court did not address the petitioner's\n\nclaim     that   his   actual    innocence     trumped   the     Commonwealth's\n\nlimitations defense.       The district court issued a certificate of\n\nappealability, 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), and this timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            The AEDPA states in pertinent part that a \"1-year period\n\nof limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\n\ncourt.\"    Id. § 2244(d)(1).         The statute expressly provides that the\n\nlimitations period is tolled by a \"properly filed application for\n\nState     post-conviction       or     other   collateral      review.\"    Id.\n\n§ 2244(d)(2).     Equitable tolling is not mentioned.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            The essence of equitable tolling is that, \"in exceptional\n\ncircumstances,    a   statute   of     limitations   'may   be   extended   for\n\nequitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the\n\nlimitations period.'\" Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (quoting David v. Hall, 318 F.3d 343, 345-46 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).    After this case was briefed and argued, the Supreme Court\n\ndetermined that the AEDPA limitations period is subject to equitable\n\ntolling in appropriate circumstances.          See Holland v. Florida, 130\n\nS. Ct. 2549, 2560 (2010).        The Holland Court recognized that the\n\n\"exercise of a court's equity powers . . . must be made on a case-\n\nby-case basis,\" id. at 2563 (quoting Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S.\n\n360, 375 (1964)), and instructed lower courts to \"exercise judgment\n\nin light of prior precedent, but with awareness of the fact that\n\nspecific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could\n\nwarrant special treatment in an appropriate case,\" id.\n\n            This court has not yet responded to Holland.              We have\n\ncautioned, however, in a pre-Holland habeas case, that equitable\n\ntolling \"is the exception rather than the rule,\" and that \"resort\n\nto   its   prophylaxis   is   deemed    justified    only   in   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.\"       Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).     These admonitions are consistent with the teachings of\n\nHolland.\n\n            A habeas petitioner bears the burden of establishing the\n\nbasis for equitable tolling. Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2562. To carry\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthis burden, he must demonstrate \"'(1) that he has been pursuing his\n\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance\n\nstood in his way' and prevented timely filing.\"                    Id. (quoting Pace\n\nv. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005)); see Trapp v. Spencer, 479\n\nF.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir. 2007) (listing additional factors that may,\n\nin a given case, influence a habeas court's decision about whether\n\nto grant equitable tolling).\n\n            In    the   case      at   hand,      we    must    decide     whether   the\n\npetitioner's      mental         illness        constitutes       an      extraordinary\n\ncircumstance that equitably tolls the AEDPA limitations period.\n\nThis inquiry is binary. First, we must decide whether, as a general\n\nproposition, mental illness can qualify as an acceptable basis for\n\nequitable   tolling.        If     so,    we     then    must   decide     whether   the\n\npetitioner's mental illness warrants equitable tolling. We take the\n\ntwo halves of the inquiry in order.\n\n            Although      this    court     has    yet    to    address    the   generic\n\nquestion of whether mental illness can constitute a ground for\n\nequitable tolling in a habeas case, some other courts of appeals\n\nhave   answered    that    question        in    the    affirmative.        See,   e.g.,\n\nBolarinwa v. Williams, 593 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir. 2010); Hunter v.\n\nFerrell, 587 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam); Laws v.\n\nLamarque, 351 F.3d 919, 923 (9th Cir. 2003).                     No circuit has held\n\nto the contrary.        Moreover, our own case law points in the same\n\ndirection; in a different context, we recognized that mental illness\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcan equitably toll a federal statute of limitations.          See Nunnally\n\nv. MacCausland, 996 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (applying\n\nequitable tolling in the context of the Civil Service Reform Act).\n\nWe see no reason for refusing to extend that principle to the AEDPA\n\ncontext.     We hold, therefore, that mental illness can constitute an\n\nextraordinary circumstance, which may prevent a habeas petitioner\n\nfrom understanding and acting upon his legal rights and thereby\n\nequitably toll the AEDPA limitations period.\n\n             We proceed now to the second dimension of our inquiry.\n\nMental illness does not per se toll the AEDPA limitations period.\n\nSee Bolarinwa, 593 F.3d at 232; Hunter, 587 F.3d at 1308.            There\n\nmust be some causal link between a petitioner's mental illness and\n\nhis ability seasonably to file for habeas relief.              See, e.g.,\n\nBolarinwa, 593 F.3d at 232 (requiring that petitioner \"demonstrate\n\nthat   her    particular   disability    constituted   an   'extraordinary\n\ncircumstance' severely impairing her ability to comply with the\n\nfiling deadline, despite her diligent efforts to do so\"); Hunter,\n\n587 F.3d at 1308 (stating that \"the alleged mental impairment must\n\nhave affected the petitioner's ability to file a timely habeas\n\npetition\"); Laws, 351 F.3d at 923 (allowing tolling so long as the\n\n\"petitioner's mental incompetence in fact caused him to fail to meet\n\nthe AEDPA filing deadline\"); cf. Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2562\n\n(requiring a habeas petitioner to show that \"some extraordinary\n\ncircumstance . . . prevented timely filing\").\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            In our view, a habeas petitioner satisfies the causation\n\nrequirement if he can show that, during the relevant time frame, he\n\nsuffered from a mental illness or impairment that so severely\n\nimpaired his ability either effectively to pursue legal relief to\n\nhis own behoof or, if represented, effectively to assist and\n\ncommunicate with counsel.        See Nunnally, 996 F.2d at 6-7 (framing\n\nthe question as \"whether plaintiff's mental condition rendered her\n\nincapable   of   rationally     cooperating      with   any   counsel,    and/or\n\npursuing her claim on her own during the limitations period\").                   If\n\na habeas petitioner satisfies this standard, he should not be held\n\nstrictly accountable for complying with the AEDPA's filing deadline.\n\n            In the case at hand, the district court ruled that the\n\npetitioner's mental illness was not sufficiently disabling to toll\n\nthe limitations period.        Riva, 2007 WL 954771, at *6.           We review a\n\ndistrict court's determination about whether a particular set of\n\nfacts   warrants   equitable     tolling    of    the   AEDPA's       statute    of\n\nlimitations for abuse of discretion.             See Cordle v. Guarino, 428\n\nF.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir. 2005); Neverson, 366 F.3d at 42.                  Abuse of\n\ndiscretion is not a monolithic standard of review; within it,\n\nabstract questions of law are reviewed de novo, findings of raw fact\n\nare   reviewed   for   clear    error,   and     judgment     calls    receive   a\n\nclassically deferential reception.         See United States v. Lewis, 517\n\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2008); Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Son\n\nLtd., 427 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          With this prelude, we turn to the time line in this case.\n\nThe petitioner's conviction became final in 1985, well before\n\nCongress passed the AEDPA.   Thus, the petitioner was entitled to a\n\none-year grace period running from April 24, 1996 (the AEDPA's\n\neffective date) within which to seek federal habeas relief.       See\n\nDelaney, 264 F.3d at 10; Gaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (per curiam).\n\n          The petitioner did not file the instant habeas petition\n\nuntil October 15, 2001.   That was beyond the one-year grace period.\n\nThus, absent tolling, the statute of limitations would have expired\n\non April 24, 1997.\n\n          The petitioner's second motion to revise or revoke his\n\nsentence is of no help to him.   Even though that motion was pending\n\non April 24, 1996, it did not toll the limitations period because\n\nit was not a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction\n\nor other collateral review.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).   The motion\n\nto revise or revoke was filed in 1993, several years beyond the\n\nperiod designated for the filing of such a motion.2   It follows that\n\nthe motion was untimely, and an untimely state post-conviction\n\nmotion is not properly filed.    See Pace, 544 U.S. at 414; Artuz v.\n\nBennett, 531 U.S. 4, 8 (2000).\n\n\n\n     2\n       Under Massachusetts practice such a motion must be filed no\nlater than sixty days from the date of sentencing or such later\ndate when an appellate court either affirms the conviction or\ndenies review. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            The intervening period was partially tolled, however, by\n\nthe pendency of the petitioner's fourth new trial motion in state\n\ncourt, so the clock did not run from March 17, 1999 (the date on\n\nwhich that motion was filed) to June 7, 2001 (the date on which the\n\nSJC denied the ALOFAR).3         The petitioner does not allege that the\n\nfour-month period between the latter date and his filing of the\n\ninstant     petition   for   a    writ   of    habeas   corpus   was   tolled.\n\nConsequently, the petition is time-barred unless the petitioner can\n\nshow that his mental illness tolled the limitations period during\n\nmost of the time span from April 24, 1996, to March 17, 1999 — what\n\nwe shall call the \"tolling period.\"\n\n            The medical reports in the record indicate quite clearly\n\nthat the petitioner suffered from a debilitating mental illness\n\nthroughout the tolling interval.              After his conviction, he was\n\ncommitted to Bridgewater for a total of seventeen years, including\n\nmost recently from 1990 to 1999.            The documented symptoms of his\n\nparanoid schizophrenia included \"bizarre delusions of a persecutory\n\nnature, paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations and somatic\n\nterrors.\"\n\n\n\n     3\n       The district court incorrectly stated that the statute of\nlimitations began to run anew on December 13, 1999, when the\nsuperior court denied the motion. See Riva, 2007 WL 954771, at *4.\nTolling continued, however, as long as the state courts had the\nmotion under review. See Currie v. Matesanz, 281 F.3d 261, 266\n(1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that a motion for new trial filed in\nMassachusetts remains pending from the time it is first filed until\nthe time when the SJC denies further review).\n\n                                     -12-\n\f          The petitioner's annual master treatment plan, prepared\n\non June 28, 1996, confirms the incidence of these symptoms during\n\nthe tolling period.          For example, the plan indicates that the\n\npetitioner underwent \"recent experiences of auditory and visual\n\nhallucinations\" and \"urges to consume blood and flesh of others.\"\n\nIt also describes his \"poor, schizotypal presentation combined with\n\n[an] inability to manage bizarre impulses,\" which made him \"a very\n\nhigh danger to himself and others.\"           Under the heading \"Identified\n\nProblem(s),\"    the   plan    notes    a    \"delusional   system     marked   by\n\nviolent/paranoid ideation.\"\n\n          The petitioner's position is further bolstered by the\n\ntestimonial    evidence.       In   the    district   court,   the   petitioner\n\npresented expert testimony vouchsafing that his mental illness\n\nprecluded him from consistently and effectively pursuing legal\n\nrelief until August of 1999 (that is, throughout the tolling\n\nperiod). His symptoms did not subside until the doctors changed his\n\ntreatment protocol — a change that led to his discharge from\n\nBridgewater in August of 1999.\n\n          The petitioner's medical expert, Dr. Montgomery C. Brower,\n\nis a forensic psychiatrist and former deputy medical director at\n\nBridgewater. He interviewed the petitioner in 2006 and reviewed the\n\nmedical records and court filings. In an affidavit submitted to the\n\ndistrict court, Dr. Brower explained that the petitioner was treated\n\nwith anti-psychotic medications during his stay at Bridgewater and\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthat,   although     his   acute    psychotic    symptoms      improved        with\n\nmedication, he nonetheless \"continued to experience, and at times\n\nact upon, an obsessional preoccupation with the delusion that he\n\nneeded to obtain and consume human flesh.\"            Dr. Brower explained\n\nthat \"this residual psychosis interfered with Mr. Riva's ability to\n\nsustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently and\n\neffectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\"              It was not\n\nuntil the petitioner's treatment with a new drug, Zyprexa, beginning\n\nin May of 1999, that his \"delusional preoccupation with obtaining\n\nand consuming human flesh progressively diminished, fading away\n\ncompletely within nine months to a year.\"\n\n            Dr. Brower also examined the petitioner's writings made\n\nboth before and after his treatment with Zyprexa.             The psychiatrist\n\nconcluded    that   \"[d]ocuments    written   after   .   .    .   show   better\n\norganization and greater fluency and flexibility in Mr. Riva's\n\nthinking.\"\n\n            The Commonwealth offered no expert testimony, so Dr.\n\nBrower's views are uncontradicted.         Those views are consistent with\n\nthe petitioner's affidavit, in which he declares that before the\n\nadministration of Zyprexa, \"I experienced periods of lucidity during\n\nwhich I was able to read, write, and think about my legal case.\n\nThese   periods     of   lucidity   were    frequently    disrupted       by    my\n\npreoccupation with obtaining and consuming human flesh.                    Thus,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fbefore August 1999, I could not focus long and well enough to\n\nproperly attend to my legal case.\"\n\n               The district court rejected the testimony of Dr. Brower,\n\nrelying instead on (i) the court filings made by the petitioner from\n\n1985     to     1999   and    (ii)    observations      about   the    petitioner's\n\nintelligence (contained in the 1999 Bridgewater discharge summary).\n\nSee Riva, 2007 WL 954771, at *5-6.               Although a trial court need not\n\naccept uncontradicted expert testimony, see, e.g., Parrilla-López\n\nv.   United      States,     841   F.2d   16,    19   (1st   Cir.   1988),   it   must\n\narticulate a reasoned basis for refusing to do so.                     The district\n\ncourt's reasoning was flawed.\n\n               For one thing, the court's analysis of the petitioner's\n\nfilings contains several factual errors.                The court stated that the\n\npetitioner filed four pro se habeas petitions between 1985 and 1999.\n\nRiva, 2007 WL 954771, at *5.              In fact, the petitioner filed three\n\nhabeas petitions during that interval, only two of which were filed\n\npro se. The court further stated that the petitioner made three pro\n\nse filings during the tolling period, referencing a 1996 motion for\n\nnew trial, a 1998 petition for habeas corpus, and a 1999 petition\n\nfor habeas corpus.           Id.     There was no 1996 pro se motion for new\n\ntrial.        The record reflects that the petitioner's counsel filed a\n\nmotion for new trial in 1995, and the petitioner filed a pro se\n\nmotion for new trial on March 17, 1999 (which tolled the running of\n\nthe limitations period).               To be sure, there was a 1998 habeas\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fpetition, but it was not filed pro se. There was no habeas petition\n\nfiled in 1999.\n\n            Courts should not be held to a standard of perfection, and\n\nsmall factual errors — even a series of small factual errors — do\n\nnot necessarily undermine a trial court's ruling.                  But everything\n\ndepends    on    context.        Here,     the   court's   factual      errors   are\n\nsignificant because, in the aggregate, they cast doubt upon its\n\nprimary reason for rejecting the petitioner's uncontradicted expert\n\ntestimony:      the   district     court    reasoned   that      the   petitioner's\n\n\"repeated       submissions   to    courts\"      during    the    tolling    period\n\nmanifested his ability effectively to exercise his legal rights.\n\nId. at *6. The court's misapprehension of the relevant facts shakes\n\nour confidence in this conclusion.\n\n            Withal, there is one pro se filing reflected in the record\n\nduring the tolling period: the petitioner's request voluntarily to\n\ndismiss his 1996 habeas petition based on exhaustion concerns. This\n\nfiling tends to indicate the petitioner's understanding of his legal\n\nrights.     But that motion, too, must be weighed in context.                    The\n\nrecord indicates that the petitioner never served the respondent in\n\nthat case and, for aught that appears, never made any substantive\n\nfilings.\n\n            The petitioner's 1998 habeas petition also falls within\n\nthe tolling period.       That petition, however, was drafted and filed\n\nby counsel retained by the petitioner's father.                        There is no\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fevidence that the petitioner communicated with counsel regarding\n\nthis     filing;   indeed,       the   petitioner    alleges,      again    without\n\ncontradiction in the record, that the petition was filed without his\n\nconsent.     This is borne out, at least inferentially, by the fact\n\nthat the petition was dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\n            A second — and deeper — flaw in the district court's\n\nanalysis is its heavy reliance on the fact of the petitioner's\n\nfilings as opposed to either their content or their quality.                   This\n\nflaw is exacerbated by two other data points: the court's failure\n\nto   address   the   petitioner's       ability     to   sustain    the    lucidity\n\nnecessary to effectively pursue legal redress once filings were\n\neffected, and its failure to consider whether the counselled filings\n\nenjoyed the petitioner's effective participation.\n\n            To illustrate, the district court relied on the fact that\n\nthe petitioner, either pro se or through counsel, had taken a direct\n\nappeal and filed four new trial motions in the state courts.                   Id.\n\nat *5.    Yet the court did not discount these filings at all despite\n\nthe petitioner's obvious insanity at certain critical times (e.g.,\n\nwhile counsel was pressing the second motion for new trial, the\n\npetitioner     assaulted     a    correctional    officer    under    a    paranoid\n\ndelusion and was recommitted to Bridgewater).\n\n            By the same token, the district court did not take into\n\naccount that, after the petitioner's third motion for new trial was\n\ndenied and the petitioner's counsel withdrew, the petitioner's pro\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fse   appeal    was    dismissed   on   February   23,    1996,   for    want   of\n\nprosecution.      That dismissal, ignored by the district court, tends\n\nto support Dr. Brower's conclusion that, during the tolling period,\n\nthe petitioner's \"residual psychosis interfered with [his] ability\n\nto sustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently\n\nand effectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\"\n\n              The final cause for concern involves the district court's\n\nreliance on a report of the petitioner's intelligence.                 The court\n\nreasoned that the petitioner's mental illness did not prevent him\n\nfrom complying with the filing deadline in part because his \"overall\n\ncognitive abilities fall in the upper end of the average range.\" Id.\n\nBut this is something of a non-sequitur.            The petitioner is not\n\nclaiming that he lacked the intelligence to comprehend and act upon\n\nhis legal rights but, rather, that he lacked the sanity necessary\n\nto consistently and effectively pursue his legal rights.\n\n              There is no necessary correlation between intelligence and\n\nsanity, and the petitioner's claim does not depend on his IQ.                  In\n\nfact, the very report that contained the information about the\n\npetitioner's high intelligence noted that his \"test profile reflects\n\nconsiderable test scatter, suggestive of                uneven and disrupted\n\nfunctioning.\"        And Dr. Brower concluded that the petitioner's high\n\nIQ substantiated the diagnosis of schizophrenia because the large\n\ndiscrepancy between the petitioner's verbal and performance IQ\n\n\"typically indicates an organic abnormality in the functioning of\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fthe left hemisphere of the brain,\" which is \"associated with\n\nschizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia.\"\n\n          We   have   held   that    when   a    district   court   \"plainly\n\nconsider[s] all the pertinent factors and no impertinent ones,\" and\n\nprovides a \"thorough explanation\" of its reasoning, its \"refusal to\n\napply principles of equitable tolling to salvage the petitioner's\n\ntime-barred habeas application\" does not constitute an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Delaney, 264 F.3d at 15; see Donovan v. Maine, 276 F.3d\n\n87, 93 (1st Cir. 2002).      Here, however, the lower court failed to\n\nconsider relevant factors such as the content and quality of the\n\npetitioner's court filings.     To compound this oversight, the court\n\nrelied on an impertinent factor: the petitioner's raw intelligence.\n\nFinally, the court's explanation for rejecting the uncontroverted\n\nexpert testimony depended on mischaracterizations of the facts.\n\nThese difficulties, in combination, counsel against a finding that\n\nthe district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in\n\nrejecting the petitioner's claim of equitable tolling.\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.            This is a complex case, in\n\nwhich various pieces of evidence point in different directions.          It\n\nis a close call as to whether or not equitable tolling is warranted,\n\nand we do not suggest what that call ultimately should be.            Here,\n\nhowever, there are simply too many unanswered questions to permit\n\nthe judgment below to stand.        Accordingly, we vacate the judgment\n\nand remand to the district court for further development of the\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\frecord with a view toward determining whether the petitioner's\n\nmental illness so severely impaired his ability effectively to\n\npursue legal relief, either on his own behalf or through counsel,\n\nas to warrant equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period.4\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.   For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       The petitioner argues in the alternative that his actual\ninnocence tolled the statute of limitations. See David, 318 F.3d\nat 347-48 (expressing skepticism as to whether a habeas\npetitioner's actual innocence can override the AEDPA's limitations\nperiod).   The district court did not pass upon this claim.     On\nremand, the district court should consider it.     See Kuenzel v.\nAllen, 488 F.3d 1341, 1343 n.3 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam); see\nalso López López v. Aran, 844 F.2d 898, 910 n.16 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                                    -20-\n\f",

We hold that the district court correctly answered this question in the affirmative. We nonetheless hold that the district court's further determination that the petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling rests on too unsteady a foundation. Consequently, we vacate the order dismissing the habeas petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This case is fact-intensive, so we take pains to mine the record and recite the relevant background in some detail. The facts themselves are largely undisputed (although they support conflicting inferences).</p>\n<p>The petitioner, James Riva, II, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. His history of severe mental illness dates back to his adolescence. His condition has required intermittent hospitalization since 1974.</p>\n<p>On April 10, 1980, the petitioner killed his grandmother while under a paranoid delusion that, if he did not, he would fall prey to a society of vampires. He was found competent to stand trial in state court and, on October 30, 1981, a jury convicted him of second-degree murder, arson, and assault and battery on a police officer. The trial justice sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the petitioner was committed to Bridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater), where he remained until January 24, 1989. At that point, he was transferred to the general prison population. His stay there was short-lived; he was sent back to Bridgewater on September 6, 1990, after he assaulted a correctional officer while under a paranoid delusion that the officer had been draining fluid from the petitioner's spine. The petitioner was charged criminally for the assault, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p>The petitioner remained at Bridgewater until August of 1999. During this interlude, he attempted to challenge his convictions in both state and federal courts. His trial counsel, John Spinale, filed a timely notice of appeal and motions for new trial and to revise or revoke the sentence. The trial justice denied the latter two motions, and Spinale withdrew as counsel. Attorney Willie Davis handled the appeal. The Massachusetts Appeals Court (MAC) affirmed both the convictions and the denial of the motion for new trial. <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 18 Mass.App.Ct. 713, 469 N.E.2d 1307, 1312 (1984). On January 4, 1985, the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) denied the petitioner's application for leave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> to obtain further appellate review (ALOFAR). <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 393 Mass. 1105, 474 N.E.2d 181 (1985) (table).</p>\n<p>In 1987 the petitioner, acting pro se, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. The court dismissed the application on the ground that it contained unexhausted claims. We affirmed. <i>Riva v. Getchell,</i> 873 F.2d 1434 (1st Cir.1989) (table).</p>\n<p>On June 2, 1988, the petitioner, again acting pro se, filed a second motion for new trial. The state superior court appointed Dana Alan Curhan as counsel. Curhan filed an amended motion for new trial or post-conviction relief. The superior court denied the amended motion. The petitioner's counselled appeal was unsuccessful, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 34 Mass. App.Ct. 1126, 615 N.E.2d 606 (1993) (table), and the SJC refused to grant an ALOFAR, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 416 Mass. 1102, 618 N.E.2d 1364 (1993) (table).</p>\n<p>Although Curhan's representation ended at that juncture, the petitioner was undaunted. On August 2, 1993, he filed a pro se motion to revise or revoke his sentence. His newly appointed counsel, Richard Passalacqua, filed a third motion for new trial on May 11, 1995. The superior court denied this motion approximately three months later, and Passalacqua withdrew as counsel.</p>\n<p>The petitioner appealed pro se, but the MAC eventually dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution. On October 28, 1996, the superior court denied the petitioner's pro se motion to revise or revoke his sentence.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the petitioner was attacking on a second front. On February 1, 1996, he repaired to the federal district court and filed another pro se application for habeas relief. The district court originally dismissed this case for insufficiency of service of process but later reopened it. The reopening came to naught, as the petitioner, apparently concerned about exhaustion, moved for a voluntary dismissal on November 25, 1996. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a). The district court granted that motion. <i>Riva v. DuBois,</i> No. 96-10273 (D.Mass. Feb. 21, 1997) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>The petitioner's father hired Barbara Smith as counsel to prepare a third federal habeas petition. Smith died before completing the task, but on January 6, 1998, her law firm filed the habeas petition (quite possibly without the petitioner's consent). Because no authorization had been obtained to file a successive habeas petition, the district court transferred the case to this court.<sup>[1]</sup> We dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute. <i>Riva v. Nelson,</i> No. 99-1071 (1st Cir. Oct. 28, 1999) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>On March 17, 1999, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed a fourth new trial motion. The superior court denied this motion on December 13, 1999. The MAC affirmed that order, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 752 N.E.2d 242 (Mass.App.Ct.2001) (table), and the SJC denied an ALOFAR, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 434 Mass. 1105, 752 N.E.2d 240 (2001) (table).</p>\n<p>On October 15, 2001, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed the habeas petition with which we are concerned. The district court appointed counsel and ultimately dismissed the petition as untimely. <i>Riva v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> <i>Ficco,</i> No. 01-12061, 2007 WL 954771, at *6 (D.Mass. Mar.28, 2007). The court held that the AEDPA statute of limitations was not tolled on the basis of the petitioner's mental illness. <i>Id.</i> It reasoned that the petitioner's prolific filings in both state and federal courts demonstrated a capacity to comply with the filing deadline. <i>Id.</i> at *5. The court did not address the petitioner's claim that his actual innocence trumped the Commonwealth's limitations defense. The district court issued a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), and this timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The AEDPA states in pertinent part that a \"1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2244(d)(1). The statute expressly provides that the limitations period is tolled by a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2244(d)(2). Equitable tolling is not mentioned.</p>\n<p>The essence of equitable tolling is that, \"in exceptional circumstances, a statute of limitations `may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.'\" <i>Neverson v. Farquharson,</i> 366 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>David v. Hall,</i> 318 F.3d 343, 345-46 (1st Cir.2003)). After this case was briefed and argued, the Supreme Court determined that the AEDPA limitations period is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Holland v. Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2560, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). The <i>Holland</i> Court recognized that the \"exercise of a court's equity powers ... must be made on a case-by-case basis,\" <i>id.</i> at 2563 (quoting <i>Baggett v. Bullitt,</i> 377 U.S. 360, 375, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964)), and instructed lower courts to \"exercise judgment in light of prior precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n<p>This court has not yet responded to <i>Holland.</i> We have cautioned, however, in a pre-<i>Holland</i> habeas case, that equitable tolling \"is the exception rather than the rule,\" and that \"resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances.\" <i>Delaney v. Matesanz,</i> 264 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2001). These admonitions are consistent with the teachings of <i>Holland.</i></p>\n<p>A habeas petitioner bears the burden of establishing the basis for equitable tolling. <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562. To carry this burden, he must demonstrate \"`(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way' and prevented timely filing.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pace v. DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)); <i>see </i><i>Trapp v. Spencer,</i> 479 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir.2007) (listing additional factors that may, in a given case, influence a habeas court's decision about whether to grant equitable tolling).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, we must decide whether the petitioner's mental illness constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that equitably tolls the AEDPA limitations period. This inquiry is binary. First, we must decide whether, as a general proposition, mental illness can qualify as an acceptable basis for equitable tolling. If so, we then must decide whether the petitioner's mental illness warrants equitable tolling. We take the two halves of the inquiry in order.</p>\n<p>Although this court has yet to address the generic question of whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> mental illness can constitute a ground for equitable tolling in a habeas case, some other courts of appeals have answered that question in the affirmative. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bolarinwa v. Williams,</i> 593 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir.2010); <i>Hunter v. Ferrell,</i> 587 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <i>Laws v. Lamarque,</i> 351 F.3d 919, 923 (9th Cir.2003). No circuit has held to the contrary. Moreover, our own case law points in the same direction; in a different context, we recognized that mental illness can equitably toll a federal statute of limitations. <i>See </i><i>Nunnally v. MacCausland,</i> 996 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (applying equitable tolling in the context of the Civil Service Reform Act). We see no reason for refusing to extend that principle to the AEDPA context. We hold, therefore, that mental illness can constitute an extraordinary circumstance, which may prevent a habeas petitioner from understanding and acting upon his legal rights and thereby equitably toll the AEDPA limitations period.</p>\n<p>We proceed now to the second dimension of our inquiry. Mental illness does not per se toll the AEDPA limitations period. <i>See </i><i>Bolarinwa,</i> 593 F.3d at 232; <i>Hunter,</i> 587 F.3d at 1308. There must be some causal link between a petitioner's mental illness and his ability seasonably to file for habeas relief. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bolarinwa,</i> 593 F.3d at 232 (requiring that petitioner \"demonstrate that her particular disability constituted an `extraordinary circumstance' severely impairing her ability to comply with the filing deadline, despite her diligent efforts to do so\"); <i>Hunter,</i> 587 F.3d at 1308 (stating that \"the alleged mental impairment must have affected the petitioner's ability to file a timely habeas petition\"); <i>Laws,</i> 351 F.3d at 923 (allowing tolling so long as the \"petitioner's mental incompetence in fact caused him to fail to meet the AEDPA filing deadline\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (requiring a habeas petitioner to show that \"some extraordinary circumstance ... prevented timely filing\").</p>\n<p>In our view, a habeas petitioner satisfies the causation requirement if he can show that, during the relevant time frame, he suffered from a mental illness or impairment that so severely impaired his ability either effectively to pursue legal relief to his own behoof or, if represented, effectively to assist and communicate with counsel. <i>See </i><i>Nunnally,</i> 996 F.2d at 6-7 (framing the question as \"whether plaintiff's mental condition rendered her incapable of rationally cooperating with any counsel, and/or pursuing her claim on her own during the limitations period\"). If a habeas petitioner satisfies this standard, he should not be held strictly accountable for complying with the AEDPA's filing deadline.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court ruled that the petitioner's mental illness was not sufficiently disabling to toll the limitations period. <i>Riva,</i> 2007 WL 954771, at *6. We review a district court's determination about whether a particular set of facts warrants equitable tolling of the AEDPA's statute of limitations for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cordle v. Guarino,</i> 428 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Neverson,</i> 366 F.3d at 42. Abuse of discretion is not a monolithic standard of review; within it, abstract questions of law are reviewed de novo, findings of raw fact are reviewed for clear error, and judgment calls receive a classically deferential reception. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 517 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes &amp; Son Ltd.,</i> 427 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>With this prelude, we turn to the time line in this case. The petitioner's conviction became final in 1985, well before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> Congress passed the AEDPA. Thus, the petitioner was entitled to a one-year grace period running from April 24, 1996 (the AEDPA's effective date) within which to seek federal habeas relief. <i>See </i><i>Delaney,</i> 264 F.3d at 10; <i>Gaskins v. Duval,</i> 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>The petitioner did not file the instant habeas petition until October 15, 2001. That was beyond the one-year grace period. Thus, absent tolling, the statute of limitations would have expired on April 24, 1997.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's second motion to revise or revoke his sentence is of no help to him. Even though that motion was pending on April 24, 1996, it did not toll the limitations period because it was not a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2). The motion to revise or revoke was filed in 1993, several years beyond the period designated for the filing of such a motion.<sup>[2]</sup> It follows that the motion was untimely, and an untimely state post-conviction motion is not properly filed. <i>See </i><i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S. at 414, 125 S.Ct. 1807; <i>Artuz v. Bennett,</i> 531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000).</p>\n<p>The intervening period was partially tolled, however, by the pendency of the petitioner's fourth new trial motion in state court, so the clock did not run from March 17, 1999 (the date on which that motion was filed) to June 7, 2001 (the date on which the SJC denied the ALOFAR).<sup>[3]</sup> The petitioner does not allege that the four-month period between the latter date and his filing of the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus was tolled. Consequently, the petition is time-barred unless the petitioner can show that his mental illness tolled the limitations period during most of the time span from April 24, 1996, to March 17, 1999what we shall call the \"tolling period.\"</p>\n<p>The medical reports in the record indicate quite clearly that the petitioner suffered from a debilitating mental illness throughout the tolling interval. After his conviction, he was committed to Bridgewater for a total of seventeen years, including most recently from 1990 to 1999. The documented symptoms of his paranoid schizophrenia included \"bizarre delusions of a persecutory nature, paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations and somatic terrors.\"</p>\n<p>The petitioner's annual master treatment plan, prepared on June 28, 1996, confirms the incidence of these symptoms during the tolling period. For example, the plan indicates that the petitioner underwent \"recent experiences of auditory and visual hallucinations\" and \"urges to consume blood and flesh of others.\" It also describes his \"poor, schizotypal presentation combined with [an] inability to manage bizarre impulses,\" which made him \"a very high danger to himself and others.\" Under the heading \"Identified Problem(s),\" the plan notes a \"delusional system marked by violent/paranoid ideation.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> The petitioner's position is further bolstered by the testimonial evidence. In the district court, the petitioner presented expert testimony vouchsafing that his mental illness precluded him from consistently and effectively pursuing legal relief until August of 1999 (that is, throughout the tolling period). His symptoms did not subside until the doctors changed his treatment protocola change that led to his discharge from Bridgewater in August of 1999.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's medical expert, Dr. Montgomery C. Brower, is a forensic psychiatrist and former deputy medical director at Bridgewater. He interviewed the petitioner in 2006 and reviewed the medical records and court filings. In an affidavit submitted to the district court, Dr. Brower explained that the petitioner was treated with anti-psychotic medications during his stay at Bridgewater and that, although his acute psychotic symptoms improved with medication, he nonetheless \"continued to experience, and at times act upon, an obsessional preoccupation with the delusion that he needed to obtain and consume human flesh.\" Dr. Brower explained that \"this residual psychosis interfered with Mr. Riva's ability to sustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently and effectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\" It was not until the petitioner's treatment with a new drug, Zyprexa, beginning in May of 1999, that his \"delusional preoccupation with obtaining and consuming human flesh progressively diminished, fading away completely within nine months to a year.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Brower also examined the petitioner's writings made both before and after his treatment with Zyprexa. The psychiatrist concluded that \"[d]ocuments written after ... show better organization and greater fluency and flexibility in Mr. Riva's thinking.\"</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth offered no expert testimony, so Dr. Brower's views are uncontradicted. Those views are consistent with the petitioner's affidavit, in which he declares that before the administration of Zyprexa, \"I experienced periods of lucidity during which I was able to read, write, and think about my legal case. These periods of lucidity were frequently disrupted by my preoccupation with obtaining and consuming human flesh. Thus, before August 1999, I could not focus long and well enough to properly attend to my legal case.\"</p>\n<p>The district court rejected the testimony of Dr. Brower, relying instead on (i) the court filings made by the petitioner from 1985 to 1999 and (ii) observations about the petitioner's intelligence (contained in the 1999 Bridgewater discharge summary). <i>See Riva,</i> 2007 WL 954771, at *5-6. Although a trial court need not accept uncontradicted expert testimony, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Parrilla-López v. United States,</i> 841 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1988), it must articulate a reasoned basis for refusing to do so. The district court's reasoning was flawed.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the court's analysis of the petitioner's filings contains several factual errors. The court stated that the petitioner filed four pro se habeas petitions between 1985 and 1999. <i>Riva,</i> 2007 WL 954771, at *5. In fact, the petitioner filed three habeas petitions during that interval, only two of which were filed pro se. The court further stated that the petitioner made three pro se filings during the tolling period, referencing a 1996 motion for new trial, a 1998 petition for habeas corpus, and a 1999 petition for habeas corpus. <i>Id.</i> There was no 1996 pro se motion for new trial. The record reflects that the petitioner's counsel filed a motion for new trial in 1995, and the petitioner filed a pro se <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> motion for new trial on March 17, 1999 (which tolled the running of the limitations period). To be sure, there was a 1998 habeas petition, but it was not filed pro se. There was no habeas petition filed in 1999.</p>\n<p>Courts should not be held to a standard of perfection, and small factual errors even a series of small factual errorsdo not necessarily undermine a trial court's ruling. But everything depends on context. Here, the court's factual errors are significant because, in the aggregate, they cast doubt upon its primary reason for rejecting the petitioner's uncontradicted expert testimony: the district court reasoned that the petitioner's \"repeated submissions to courts\" during the tolling period manifested his ability effectively to exercise his legal rights. <i>Id.</i> at *6. The court's misapprehension of the relevant facts shakes our confidence in this conclusion.</p>\n<p>Withal, there is one pro se filing reflected in the record during the tolling period: the petitioner's request voluntarily to dismiss his 1996 habeas petition based on exhaustion concerns. This filing tends to indicate the petitioner's understanding of his legal rights. But that motion, too, must be weighed in context. The record indicates that the petitioner never served the respondent in that case and, for aught that appears, never made any substantive filings.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's 1998 habeas petition also falls within the tolling period. That petition, however, was drafted and filed by counsel retained by the petitioner's father. There is no evidence that the petitioner communicated with counsel regarding this filing; indeed, the petitioner alleges, again without contradiction in the record, that the petition was filed without his consent. This is borne out, at least inferentially, by the fact that the petition was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p>A secondand deeperflaw in the district court's analysis is its heavy reliance on the fact of the petitioner's filings as opposed to either their content or their quality. This flaw is exacerbated by two other data points: the court's failure to address the petitioner's ability to sustain the lucidity necessary to effectively pursue legal redress once filings were effected, and its failure to consider whether the counseled filings enjoyed the petitioner's effective participation.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, the district court relied on the fact that the petitioner, either pro se or through counsel, had taken a direct appeal and filed four new trial motions in the state courts. <i>Id.</i> at *5. Yet the court did not discount these filings at all despite the petitioner's obvious insanity at certain critical times (e.g., while counsel was pressing the second motion for new trial, the petitioner assaulted a correctional officer under a paranoid delusion and was recommitted to Bridgewater).</p>\n<p>By the same token, the district court did not take into account that, after the petitioner's third motion for new trial was denied and the petitioner's counsel withdrew, the petitioner's pro se appeal was dismissed on February 23, 1996, for want of prosecution. That dismissal, ignored by the district court, tends to support Dr. Brower's conclusion that, during the tolling period, the petitioner's \"residual psychosis interfered with [his] ability to sustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently and effectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\"</p>\n<p>The final cause for concern involves the district court's reliance on a report of the petitioner's intelligence. The court reasoned that the petitioner's mental illness did not prevent him from complying with the filing deadline in part because his \"overall cognitive abilities fall in the upper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> end of the average range.\" <i>Id.</i> But this is something of a non-sequitur. The petitioner is not claiming that he lacked the intelligence to comprehend and act upon his legal rights but, rather, that he lacked the sanity necessary to consistently and effectively pursue his legal rights.</p>\n<p>There is no necessary correlation between intelligence and sanity, and the petitioner's claim does not depend on his IQ. In fact, the very report that contained the information about the petitioner's high intelligence noted that his \"test profile reflects considerable test scatter, suggestive of uneven and disrupted functioning.\" And Dr. Brower concluded that the petitioner's high IQ substantiated the diagnosis of schizophrenia because the large discrepancy between the petitioner's verbal and performance IQ \"typically indicates an organic abnormality in the functioning of the left hemisphere of the brain,\" which is \"associated with schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia.\"</p>\n<p>We have held that when a district court \"plainly consider[s] all the pertinent factors and no impertinent ones,\" and provides a \"thorough explanation\" of its reasoning, its \"refusal to apply principles of equitable tolling to salvage the petitioner's time-barred habeas application\" does not constitute an abuse of discretion. <i>Delaney,</i> 264 F.3d at 15; <i>see </i><i>Donovan v. Maine,</i> 276 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2002). Here, however, the lower court failed to consider relevant factors such as the content and quality of the petitioner's court filings. To compound this oversight, the court relied on an impertinent factor: the petitioner's raw intelligence. Finally, the court's explanation for rejecting the uncontroverted expert testimony depended on mischaracterizations of the facts. These difficulties, in combination, counsel against a finding that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's claim of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. This is a complex case, in which various pieces of evidence point in different directions. It is a close call as to whether or not equitable tolling is warranted, and we do not suggest what that call ultimately should be. Here, however, there are simply too many unanswered questions to permit the judgment below to stand. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for further development of the record with a view toward determining whether the petitioner's mental illness so severely impaired his ability effectively to pursue legal relief, either on his own behalf or through counsel, as to warrant equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This order was improvident. Both prior habeas petitions were dismissed for want of exhaustion. Because neither was adjudicated on the merits, the third petition was not \"successive\" within the meaning of the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b). <i>See </i><i>Slack v. McDaniel,</i> 529 U.S. 473, 487, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <i>Pratt v. United States,</i> 129 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p>[2]  Under Massachusetts practice such a motion must be filed no later than sixty days from the date of sentencing or such later date when an appellate court either affirms the conviction or denies review. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 29(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court incorrectly stated that the statute of limitations began to run anew on December 13, 1999, when the superior court denied the motion. <i>See Riva,</i> 2007 WL 954771, at *4. Tolling continued, however, as long as the state courts had the motion under review. <i>See </i><i>Currie v. Matesanz,</i> 281 F.3d 261, 266 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that a motion for new trial filed in Massachusetts remains pending from the time it is first filed until the time when the SJC denies further review).</p>\n<p>[4]  The petitioner argues in the alternative that his actual innocence tolled the statute of limitations. <i>See </i><i>David,</i> 318 F.3d at 347-48 (expressing skepticism as to whether a habeas petitioner's actual innocence can override the AEDPA's limitations period). The district court did not pass upon this claim. On remand, the district court should consider it. <i>See </i><i>Kuenzel v. Allen,</i> 488 F.3d 1341, 1343 n. 3 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam); <i>see also </i><i>López López v. Aran,</i> 844 F.2d 898, 910 n. 16 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n\n</div>",

We hold that the district court correctly answered this question in the affirmative. We nonetheless hold that the district court's further determination that the petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling rests on too unsteady a foundation. Consequently, we vacate the order dismissing the habeas petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This case is fact-intensive, so we take pains to mine the record and recite the relevant background in some detail. The facts themselves are largely undisputed (although they support conflicting inferences).</p>\n<p>The petitioner, James Riva, II, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. His history of severe mental illness dates back to his adolescence. His condition has required intermittent hospitalization since 1974.</p>\n<p>On April 10, 1980, the petitioner killed his grandmother while under a paranoid delusion that, if he did not, he would fall prey to a society of vampires. He was found competent to stand trial in state court and, on October 30, 1981, a jury convicted him of second-degree murder, arson, and assault and battery on a police officer. The trial justice sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the petitioner was committed to Bridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater), where he remained until January 24, 1989. At that point, he was transferred to the general prison population. His stay there was short-lived; he was sent back to Bridgewater on September 6, 1990, after he assaulted a correctional officer while under a paranoid delusion that the officer had been draining fluid from the petitioner's spine. The petitioner was charged criminally for the assault, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p>The petitioner remained at Bridgewater until August of 1999. During this interlude, he attempted to challenge his convictions in both state and federal courts. His trial counsel, John Spinale, filed a timely notice of appeal and motions for new trial and to revise or revoke the sentence. The trial justice denied the latter two motions, and Spinale withdrew as counsel. Attorney Willie Davis handled the appeal. The Massachusetts Appeals Court (MAC) affirmed both the convictions and the denial of the motion for new trial. <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 18 Mass.App.Ct. 713, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2162818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2162818/commonwealth-v-riva/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1312 (1984). On January 4, 1985, the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) denied the petitioner's application for leave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> to obtain further appellate review (ALOFAR). <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span> (1985) (table).</p>\n<p>In 1987 the petitioner, acting pro se, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. The court dismissed the application on the ground that it contained unexhausted claims. We affirmed. <i>Riva v. Getchell,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1434</span></span> (1st Cir.1989) (table).</p>\n<p>On June 2, 1988, the petitioner, again acting pro se, filed a second motion for new trial. The state superior court appointed Dana Alan Curhan as counsel. Curhan filed an amended motion for new trial or post-conviction relief. The superior court denied the amended motion. The petitioner's counselled appeal was unsuccessful, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> 34 Mass. App.Ct. 1126, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></span> (1993) (table), and the SJC refused to grant an ALOFAR, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></span> (1993) (table).</p>\n<p>Although Curhan's representation ended at that juncture, the petitioner was undaunted. On August 2, 1993, he filed a pro se motion to revise or revoke his sentence. His newly appointed counsel, Richard Passalacqua, filed a third motion for new trial on May 11, 1995. The superior court denied this motion approximately three months later, and Passalacqua withdrew as counsel.</p>\n<p>The petitioner appealed pro se, but the MAC eventually dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution. On October 28, 1996, the superior court denied the petitioner's pro se motion to revise or revoke his sentence.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the petitioner was attacking on a second front. On February 1, 1996, he repaired to the federal district court and filed another pro se application for habeas relief. The district court originally dismissed this case for insufficiency of service of process but later reopened it. The reopening came to naught, as the petitioner, apparently concerned about exhaustion, moved for a voluntary dismissal on November 25, 1996. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a). The district court granted that motion. <i>Riva v. DuBois,</i> No. 96-10273 (D.Mass. Feb. 21, 1997) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>The petitioner's father hired Barbara Smith as counsel to prepare a third federal habeas petition. Smith died before completing the task, but on January 6, 1998, her law firm filed the habeas petition (quite possibly without the petitioner's consent). Because no authorization had been obtained to file a successive habeas petition, the district court transferred the case to this court.<sup>[1]</sup> We dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute. <i>Riva v. Nelson,</i> No. 99-1071 (1st Cir. Oct. 28, 1999) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>On March 17, 1999, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed a fourth new trial motion. The superior court denied this motion on December 13, 1999. The MAC affirmed that order, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span> (Mass.App.Ct.2001) (table), and the SJC denied an ALOFAR, <i>Commonwealth v. Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></span> (2001) (table).</p>\n<p>On October 15, 2001, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed the habeas petition with which we are concerned. The district court appointed counsel and ultimately dismissed the petition as untimely. <i>Riva v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> <i>Ficco,</i> No. 01-12061, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">954771</span></span>, at *6 (D.Mass. Mar.28, 2007). The court held that the AEDPA statute of limitations was not tolled on the basis of the petitioner's mental illness. <i>Id.</i> It reasoned that the petitioner's prolific filings in both state and federal courts demonstrated a capacity to comply with the filing deadline. <i>Id.</i> at *5. The court did not address the petitioner's claim that his actual innocence trumped the Commonwealth's limitations defense. The district court issued a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), and this timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The AEDPA states in pertinent part that a \"1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2244(d)(1). The statute expressly provides that the limitations period is tolled by a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2244(d)(2). Equitable tolling is not mentioned.</p>\n<p>The essence of equitable tolling is that, \"in exceptional circumstances, a statute of limitations `may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.'\" <i>Neverson v. Farquharson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200987\"><a href=\"/opinion/200987/neverson-v-bissonette/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>David v.

After this case was briefed and argued, the Supreme Court determined that the AEDPA limitations period is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Holland v.

This inquiry is binary. First, we must decide whether, as a general proposition, mental illness can qualify as an acceptable basis for equitable tolling. If so, we then must decide whether the petitioner's mental illness warrants equitable tolling. We take the two halves of the inquiry in order.</p>\n<p>Although this court has yet to address the generic question of whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> mental illness can constitute a ground for equitable tolling in a habeas case, some other courts of appeals have answered that question in the affirmative. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bolarinwa v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405562/bolarinwa-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 231 (2d Cir.2010); <i>Hunter v.

Lamarque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784424\"><a href=\"/opinion/784424/brian-keith-laws-v-aa-lamarque-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span>, 923 (9th Cir.2003). No circuit has held to the contrary. Moreover, our own case law points in the same direction; in a different context, we recognized that mental illness can equitably toll a federal statute of limitations. <i>See </i><i>Nunnally v. MacCausland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609218\"><a href=\"/opinion/609218/odessa-nunnally-v-charles-maccausland/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (applying equitable tolling in the context of the Civil Service Reform Act). We see no reason for refusing to extend that principle to the AEDPA context. We hold, therefore, that mental illness can constitute an extraordinary circumstance, which may prevent a habeas petitioner from understanding and acting upon his legal rights and thereby equitably toll the AEDPA limitations period.</p>\n<p>We proceed now to the second dimension of our inquiry. Mental illness does not per se toll the AEDPA limitations period. <i>See </i><i>Bolarinwa,</i> 593 F.3d at 232; <i>Hunter,</i> 587 F.3d at 1308. There must be some causal link between a petitioner's mental illness and his ability seasonably to file for habeas relief. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bolarinwa,</i> 593 F.3d at 232 (requiring that petitioner \"demonstrate that her particular disability constituted an `extraordinary circumstance' severely impairing her ability to comply with the filing deadline, despite her diligent efforts to do so\"); <i>Hunter,</i> 587 F.3d at 1308 (stating that \"the alleged mental impairment must have affected the petitioner's ability to file a timely habeas petition\"); <i>Laws,</i> 351 F.3d at 923 (allowing tolling so long as the \"petitioner's mental incompetence in fact caused him to fail to meet the AEDPA filing deadline\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (requiring a habeas petitioner to show that \"some extraordinary circumstance ... prevented timely filing\").</p>\n<p>In our view, a habeas petitioner satisfies the causation requirement if he can show that, during the relevant time frame, he suffered from a mental illness or impairment that so severely impaired his ability either effectively to pursue legal relief to his own behoof or, if represented, effectively to assist and communicate with counsel. <i>See </i><i>Nunnally,</i> 996 F.2d at 6-7 (framing the question as \"whether plaintiff's mental condition rendered her incapable of rationally cooperating with any counsel, and/or pursuing her claim on her own during the limitations period\"). If a habeas petitioner satisfies this standard, he should not be held strictly accountable for complying with the AEDPA's filing deadline.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court ruled that the petitioner's mental illness was not sufficiently disabling to toll the limitations period. <i>Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">954771</span></span>, at *6. We review a district court's determination about whether a particular set of facts warrants equitable tolling of the AEDPA's statute of limitations for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cordle v. Guarino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201907\"><a href=\"/opinion/201907/cordle-v-guarino/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Neverson,</i> 366 F.3d at 42. Abuse of discretion is not a monolithic standard of review; within it, abstract questions of law are reviewed de novo, findings of raw fact are reviewed for clear error, and judgment calls receive a classically deferential reception. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203160\"><a href=\"/opinion/203160/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Roger Edwards, LLC v.

The petitioner's conviction became final in 1985, well before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> Congress passed the AEDPA. Thus, the petitioner was entitled to a one-year grace period running from April 24, 1996 (the AEDPA's effective date) within which to seek federal habeas relief. <i>See </i><i>Delaney,</i> 264 F.3d at 10; <i>Gaskins v. Duval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198545\"><a href=\"/opinion/198545/gaskins-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>The petitioner did not file the instant habeas petition until October 15, 2001. That was beyond the one-year grace period. Thus, absent tolling, the statute of limitations would have expired on April 24, 1997.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's second motion to revise or revoke his sentence is of no help to him. Even though that motion was pending on April 24, 1996, it did not toll the limitations period because it was not a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2). The motion to revise or revoke was filed in 1993, several years beyond the period designated for the filing of such a motion.<sup>[2]</sup> It follows that the motion was untimely, and an untimely state post-conviction motion is not properly filed. <i>See </i><i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S. at 414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142891\"><a href=\"/opinion/142891/pace-v-diguglielmo/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span> (2000).</p>\n<p>The intervening period was partially tolled, however, by the pendency of the petitioner's fourth new trial motion in state court, so the clock did not run from March 17, 1999 (the date on which that motion was filed) to June 7, 2001 (the date on which the SJC denied the ALOFAR).<sup>[3]</sup> The petitioner does not allege that the four-month period between the latter date and his filing of the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus was tolled. Consequently, the petition is time-barred unless the petitioner can show that his mental illness tolled the limitations period during most of the time span from April 24, 1996, to March 17, 1999what we shall call the \"tolling period.\"</p>\n<p>The medical reports in the record indicate quite clearly that the petitioner suffered from a debilitating mental illness throughout the tolling interval. After his conviction, he was committed to Bridgewater for a total of seventeen years, including most recently from 1990 to 1999. The documented symptoms of his paranoid schizophrenia included \"bizarre delusions of a persecutory nature, paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations and somatic terrors.\"</p>\n<p>The petitioner's annual master treatment plan, prepared on June 28, 1996, confirms the incidence of these symptoms during the tolling period. For example, the plan indicates that the petitioner underwent \"recent experiences of auditory and visual hallucinations\" and \"urges to consume blood and flesh of others.\" It also describes his \"poor, schizotypal presentation combined with [an] inability to manage bizarre impulses,\" which made him \"a very high danger to himself and others.\" Under the heading \"Identified Problem(s),\" the plan notes a \"delusional system marked by violent/paranoid ideation.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> The petitioner's position is further bolstered by the testimonial evidence. In the district court, the petitioner presented expert testimony vouchsafing that his mental illness precluded him from consistently and effectively pursuing legal relief until August of 1999 (that is, throughout the tolling period). His symptoms did not subside until the doctors changed his treatment protocola change that led to his discharge from Bridgewater in August of 1999.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's medical expert, Dr. Montgomery C. Brower, is a forensic psychiatrist and former deputy medical director at Bridgewater. He interviewed the petitioner in 2006 and reviewed the medical records and court filings. In an affidavit submitted to the district court, Dr. Brower explained that the petitioner was treated with anti-psychotic medications during his stay at Bridgewater and that, although his acute psychotic symptoms improved with medication, he nonetheless \"continued to experience, and at times act upon, an obsessional preoccupation with the delusion that he needed to obtain and consume human flesh.\" Dr. Brower explained that \"this residual psychosis interfered with Mr. Riva's ability to sustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently and effectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\" It was not until the petitioner's treatment with a new drug, Zyprexa, beginning in May of 1999, that his \"delusional preoccupation with obtaining and consuming human flesh progressively diminished, fading away completely within nine months to a year.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Brower also examined the petitioner's writings made both before and after his treatment with Zyprexa. The psychiatrist concluded that \"[d]ocuments written after ... show better organization and greater fluency and flexibility in Mr. Riva's thinking.\"</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth offered no expert testimony, so Dr. Brower's views are uncontradicted. Those views are consistent with the petitioner's affidavit, in which he declares that before the administration of Zyprexa, \"I experienced periods of lucidity during which I was able to read, write, and think about my legal case. These periods of lucidity were frequently disrupted by my preoccupation with obtaining and consuming human flesh. Thus, before August 1999, I could not focus long and well enough to properly attend to my legal case.\"</p>\n<p>The district court rejected the testimony of Dr. Brower, relying instead on (i) the court filings made by the petitioner from 1985 to 1999 and (ii) observations about the petitioner's intelligence (contained in the 1999 Bridgewater discharge summary). <i>See Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">954771</span></span>, at *5-6. Although a trial court need not accept uncontradicted expert testimony, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Parrilla-López v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502480\"><a href=\"/opinion/502480/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1988), it must articulate a reasoned basis for refusing to do so. The district court's reasoning was flawed.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the court's analysis of the petitioner's filings contains several factual errors. The court stated that the petitioner filed four pro se habeas petitions between 1985 and 1999. <i>Riva,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">954771</span></span>, at *5. In fact, the petitioner filed three habeas petitions during that interval, only two of which were filed pro se. The court further stated that the petitioner made three pro se filings during the tolling period, referencing a 1996 motion for new trial, a 1998 petition for habeas corpus, and a 1999 petition for habeas corpus. <i>Id.</i> There was no 1996 pro se motion for new trial. The record reflects that the petitioner's counsel filed a motion for new trial in 1995, and the petitioner filed a pro se <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> motion for new trial on March 17, 1999 (which tolled the running of the limitations period). To be sure, there was a 1998 habeas petition, but it was not filed pro se. There was no habeas petition filed in 1999.</p>\n<p>Courts should not be held to a standard of perfection, and small factual errors even a series of small factual errorsdo not necessarily undermine a trial court's ruling. But everything depends on context. Here, the court's factual errors are significant because, in the aggregate, they cast doubt upon its primary reason for rejecting the petitioner's uncontradicted expert testimony: the district court reasoned that the petitioner's \"repeated submissions to courts\" during the tolling period manifested his ability effectively to exercise his legal rights. <i>Id.</i> at *6. The court's misapprehension of the relevant facts shakes our confidence in this conclusion.</p>\n<p>Withal, there is one pro se filing reflected in the record during the tolling period: the petitioner's request voluntarily to dismiss his 1996 habeas petition based on exhaustion concerns. This filing tends to indicate the petitioner's understanding of his legal rights. But that motion, too, must be weighed in context. The record indicates that the petitioner never served the respondent in that case and, for aught that appears, never made any substantive filings.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's 1998 habeas petition also falls within the tolling period. That petition, however, was drafted and filed by counsel retained by the petitioner's father. There is no evidence that the petitioner communicated with counsel regarding this filing; indeed, the petitioner alleges, again without contradiction in the record, that the petition was filed without his consent. This is borne out, at least inferentially, by the fact that the petition was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p>A secondand deeperflaw in the district court's analysis is its heavy reliance on the fact of the petitioner's filings as opposed to either their content or their quality. This flaw is exacerbated by two other data points: the court's failure to address the petitioner's ability to sustain the lucidity necessary to effectively pursue legal redress once filings were effected, and its failure to consider whether the counseled filings enjoyed the petitioner's effective participation.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, the district court relied on the fact that the petitioner, either pro se or through counsel, had taken a direct appeal and filed four new trial motions in the state courts. <i>Id.</i> at *5. Yet the court did not discount these filings at all despite the petitioner's obvious insanity at certain critical times (e.g., while counsel was pressing the second motion for new trial, the petitioner assaulted a correctional officer under a paranoid delusion and was recommitted to Bridgewater).</p>\n<p>By the same token, the district court did not take into account that, after the petitioner's third motion for new trial was denied and the petitioner's counsel withdrew, the petitioner's pro se appeal was dismissed on February 23, 1996, for want of prosecution. That dismissal, ignored by the district court, tends to support Dr. Brower's conclusion that, during the tolling period, the petitioner's \"residual psychosis interfered with [his] ability to sustain the attention and effort necessary for him consistently and effectively to pursue legal review on his own behalf.\"</p>\n<p>The final cause for concern involves the district court's reliance on a report of the petitioner's intelligence. The court reasoned that the petitioner's mental illness did not prevent him from complying with the filing deadline in part because his \"overall cognitive abilities fall in the upper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> end of the average range.\" <i>Id.</i> But this is something of a non-sequitur. The petitioner is not claiming that he lacked the intelligence to comprehend and act upon his legal rights but, rather, that he lacked the sanity necessary to consistently and effectively pursue his legal rights.</p>\n<p>There is no necessary correlation between intelligence and sanity, and the petitioner's claim does not depend on his IQ. In fact, the very report that contained the information about the petitioner's high intelligence noted that his \"test profile reflects considerable test scatter, suggestive of uneven and disrupted functioning.\" And Dr. Brower concluded that the petitioner's high IQ substantiated the diagnosis of schizophrenia because the large discrepancy between the petitioner's verbal and performance IQ \"typically indicates an organic abnormality in the functioning of the left hemisphere of the brain,\" which is \"associated with schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia.\"</p>\n<p>We have held that when a district court \"plainly consider[s] all the pertinent factors and no impertinent ones,\" and provides a \"thorough explanation\" of its reasoning, its \"refusal to apply principles of equitable tolling to salvage the petitioner's time-barred habeas application\" does not constitute an abuse of discretion. <i>Delaney,</i> 264 F.3d at 15; <i>see </i><i>Donovan v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199772\"><a href=\"/opinion/199772/donovan-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2002). Here, however, the lower court failed to consider relevant factors such as the content and quality of the petitioner's court filings. To compound this oversight, the court relied on an impertinent factor: the petitioner's raw intelligence. Finally, the court's explanation for rejecting the uncontroverted expert testimony depended on mischaracterizations of the facts. These difficulties, in combination, counsel against a finding that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's claim of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. This is a complex case, in which various pieces of evidence point in different directions. It is a close call as to whether or not equitable tolling is warranted, and we do not suggest what that call ultimately should be. Here, however, there are simply too many unanswered questions to permit the judgment below to stand. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for further development of the record with a view toward determining whether the petitioner's mental illness so severely impaired his ability effectively to pursue legal relief, either on his own behalf or through counsel, as to warrant equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This order was improvident. Both prior habeas petitions were dismissed for want of exhaustion.
