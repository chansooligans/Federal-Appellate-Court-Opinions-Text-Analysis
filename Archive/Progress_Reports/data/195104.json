This  appeal has  its\n                                        \n\ngenesis  in the  real  estate recession  which  first struck  New\n\nEngland and  many other parts  of the country several  years ago.\n\nThe malaise apparently not only adversely affected the appellant,\n\nMichael  F. Carr,  a real  estate  developer, but  also the  Home\n\nFederal  Savings  Bank   (the  Bank)  from  whom  he  borrowed  a\n\nsubstantial sum of  money.  The Bank foreclosed  on an unimproved\n\nocean  lot Carr  mortgaged  to  it.   Ultimately,  the Bank  also\n\nfailed.  The  Resolution Trust Corporation  (RTC/Receiver) became\n\nits Receiver.\n\n          The RTC  succeeded the Bank  as plaintiff in  an action\n\nbrought  by the Bank,  a federally chartered  savings association\n\norganized under the  laws of the United States,  in the Worcester\n\nSuperior Court of  Massachusetts against Carr.  The  Bank sued to\n\nrecover a  deficiency on  a promissory note  executed by  Carr as\n\nevidence of  a loan from the  Bank in 1988  for $243,000, secured\n\nwith   a  first  mortgage  on  property  located  in  Marshfield,\n\nMassachusetts.  While this litigation was  in process, Carr filed\n\na   complaint  in   the  state   court   for  Middlesex   County,\n\nMassachusetts, alleging  wrongful  foreclosure  on  the  property\n\nsecuring the note.  The court consolidated the actions.\n\n          The RTC/Receiver removed the cases to the United States\n\nDistrict  Court for the District of  Massachusetts and then moved\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nfor summary judgment.   The district court granted  the motion by\n\norder  dated March  29,  1993.1   Carr  timely  appealed to  this\n\ncourt.  We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Carr obtained  a first mortgage  loan from the  Bank on\n\nhis property at  45 Old Beach Road, Marshfield, Massachusetts, on\n\nAugust  16, 1988.   Shortly before  the maturity  of the  note on\n\nSeptember  1,  1989,  Carr  requested  of the  Bank  a  one  year\n\nextension.  The Bank's Executive Committee approved the extension\n\nsubject to a number of  conditions, including the payment by Carr\n\nof a one percent extension fee in the amount of $2,430.  \n\n          The  Bank notified Carr  of the proposed  extension and\n\nits conditions  by letter dated  September 13, 1989.   The letter\n\nprovided  that the commitment to extend  \"shall expire on October\n\n16, 1989, and  that a modification agreement must  be executed on\n\nor  before  such  date.\"    The letter  also  required  that  the\n\ncommitment be accepted and  returned no later than September  22,\n\n1989, together with Carr's  check for $2,430.   Accordingly, Carr\n\naffixed  his signature in  acceptance of the  letter on September\n\n20, 1989, and  tendered the required check.   The check, however,\n\n                       \n\n   1The district court had subject matter jurisdiction under 12\n   U.S.C.   1441a(11) while we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n   U.S.C.   1291.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nwas  returned for insufficient  funds.  Thereafter,  Carr neither\n\npaidtheextension feenorexecutedthe requiredmodificationagreement.\n\n          The minutes  of the  Executive Committee approving  the\n\nextension  of the  loan  and  fixing the  extension  fee made  no\n\nmention of  a date for  the payment of  the extension fee  or any\n\ndetails pertaining to the implementation of the extension.\n\n          In   response  to   the  RTC's   interrogatories,  Carr\n\ntestified that he advised the Bank's counsel in late September or\n\nearly October 1989  that he had  another loan  with the Bank  for\n\n$1,500,000 which he expected to  refinance at the end of October,\n\nand that counsel  agreed that payment of the  extension fee could\n\nbe deferred until the refinancing of his other  loan.  He further\n\ntestified that sometime after October  24, 1989, he spoke to Paul\n\nEngstrom, Jr., a  senior loan counselor of the  Bank, advised him\n\nof the upcoming closing on the $1,500,000 loan, and that Engstrom\n\norally agreed to defer payment due under the extension until that\n\nclosing.\n\n          On October 24,  1989, the Bank  informed Carr that  his\n\nextension fee, as well as his monthly payment checks on the note,\n\nhad  been returned  for insufficient  funds.   The Bank  demanded\n\npayment of the  total arrearage and the extension  fee by October\n\n30, but  as of  November 16, 1989,  Carr had  not responded.   On\n\nNovember 17,  1989, payment not  having been made, the  Bank made\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nformal  demand under the defaulted promissory note.  Negotiations\n\nbetween  Carr and  the  Bank  again ensued  but  they reached  no\n\nagreement.    The  Bank  commenced  foreclosure  proceedings  and\n\nultimately  purchased the  mortgaged land  in April  1990 at  the\n\nforeclosure sale for $195,000.  \n\n          In his  action in  the Middlesex  Court, Carr  asserted\n\nthat the  Bank actually had agreed to extend  the due date of the\n\nnote for one  year, from September 1, 1989, to September 1, 1990,\n\nbut the  terms were changed  in the preparation of  the extension\n\ndraft.  Carr  further claimed that the September  1989 minutes of\n\nthe Bank  reflected an  appraisal of  the Marshfield  property at\n\n$325,000  and that  Carr's appraiser  subsequently  valued it  at\n\n$350,000.   Carr therefore  sought relief  because of  a wrongful\n\nforeclosure in  the face of  an agreement  to extend the  note to\n\nSeptember  1,  1990, unjust  enrichment  to the  Bank,  breach of\n\ncovenant of good  faith and fair dealing, and  failure to conduct\n\nthe  foreclosure sale  in a  commercially reasonable manner.   He\n\nalso sought reconveyance of the  property.  In addition, he filed\n\na counterclaim in the consolidated actions in the Worcester Court\n\nsubstantially identical to his complaint in the Middlesex Court.\n\n          The district  court, after the RTC removed  the case to\n\nfederal court, granted  the RTC's motion for  summary judgment in\n\nthe  consolidated  matters   based  on  the   undisputed  record,\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nincluding  a Statement of Undisputed Facts, affidavits, and other\n\nsupporting documentation filed by the RTC.\n\n                               II.\n\n          The principal issues raised on appeal by Carr are:  (1)\n\nThe Bank agreed to extend the maturity date of the $243,000 note.\n\n(2) The gap between the appraised value of the mortgaged property\n\nand  the  price  obtained  at  foreclosure  sale  barred  summary\n\njudgment  against him  for  the  deficiency  because  there  were\n\ngenuine issues of material fact whether  the foreclosure sale was\n\nconducted in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\n          Federal  Rule of  Civil Procedure  56(c) provides  that\n\nsummary  judgment may  only be  entered \"if  there is  no genuine\n\nissue  as to any material fact.\"  In reviewing a summary judgment\n\norder entered by a district court, this court has plenary powers.\n\nSee, e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,  976 F.2d 77, 78 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1992); Olivera  v. Nestle Puerto Rico, Inc., 922 F.2d 43, 45 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir. 1990).   The court, in making its review,  must \"look at the\n\nrecord in the light most  favorable to the party opposing summary\n\njudgment and accept  all reasonable inferences favorable  to such\n\nparty arising from the record.\"  Id. at 45 (citations omitted).\n                                    \n\n                               III.\n\n          Carr first  argues that  the minutes  of the  Executive\n\nCommittee did not refer to a  date for closing or for payment  of\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nthe extension fee and that the deadlines in the commitment letter\n\n\"were  not  conditions of  the  loan  extension approved  in  the\n\nExecutive  Committee minutes.\"   Therefore,  he  asserts that  in\n\nlight of the  difference between the minutes and  the language of\n\nthe  extension  commitment,  and  his  affidavit  that  the  Bank\n\nofficers had orally agreed to  defer payment of the extension fee\n\nuntil the  closing  of the  refinancing of  the $1,500,000  loan,\n\nsummary   judgment  was   inappropriate.     This   argument   is\n\ndisingenuous and has no merit whatsoever.  \n\n          The Executive Committee records reveal an approval of a\n\nrequest for a  one year extension of the loan subject to a number\n\nof conditions.   Among the conditions for the  extension were the\n\nrequirements that an extension  fee be paid and that  the loan be\n\nkept current.  \n\n          Understandably, the Executive  Committee did not  spell\n\nout  the mechanics and  language of the  extension agreement, for\n\nsuch administrative details ordinarily are left to bank officers.\n\nIn this  instance, the  officers unequivocally  provided for  the\n\npayment of the  extension fee of $2,430 \"upon  acceptance of this\n\ncommitment.\"  Carr made no  objection to the terms and conditions\n\nof the commitment and  signed his acceptance  of it a week  after\n\nthe  Executive Committee  had approved  the extension.   He  then\n\ntendered his  check  in payment  of  the fee.   Thus,  even  Carr\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nrecognized by his execution of  the letter of commitment that it,\n\nand not  the minutes,  constituted his  agreement with  the Bank.\n\nHis check, however,  was returned for  insufficient funds and  he\n\nnever paid this fee.  The commitment also required, in accordance\n\nwith the  recommendation to  the Executive  Committee, that  Carr\n\nbring his  loan  current  and supply  the  Bank  with  additional\n\nupdated  financial  information.   Additionally,  the  commitment\n\nletter  stated other  details with  respect to closing  costs and\n\nexpenses and  title examination.   Carr agreed  to its  terms but\n\nnever fulfilled any of the extension requirements after accepting\n\nthem,  including  the  execution  of  the  required  modification\n\nagreement.\n\n          Carr reaches for a straw  when he attempts to carve out\n\na contract  from the corporation minutes.   The minute book  of a\n\ncorporation is only  a brief record of the corporate proceedings.\n\n5A William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private\n                                                                 \n\nCorporations    2190 (Perm.  ed. rev.  vol. 1987).   Here,  it is\n            \n\nmerely an  internal record  which memorializes  authority to  the\n\nBank's  officers to  grant  an  extension of  Carr's  loan.   The\n\nminutes, which  of course were  never \"executed\" by Carr,  see 12\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.    1823  (e)(2) (1989),  infra,  do not  purport to  be an\n                                     \n\nagreement with him.  They in no way reflect any intention  on the\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\npart of the Executive Committee to defer payment of the extension\n\nfee until the refinancing of the $1,500,000 loan.\n\n          Similarly,   Carr's   reliance  on   an   alleged  oral\n\nsupplemental  agreement with  a bank  officer is  misplaced.   In\n\nD'Oench, Duhme  and Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), the Supreme\n                               \n\nCourt first enunciated  the common law doctrine that  the FDIC is\n\nprotected  from  unrecorded  or  oral  agreements  that  are  not\n\nreflected in one of its insured bank's records.  Id. at 461.  The\n                                                    \n\nD'Oench  doctrine bars  defenses as  well  as affirmative  claims\n       \n\nagainst the FDIC.   Timberland Design Inc. v.  First Service Bank\n                                                                 \n\nFor Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1991).  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C.\n        \n\n   1441a(b),   which  establishes  the  RTC,  and   12  U.S.C.   \n\n1441a(b)(4), the RTC possesses the  same rights and powers as are\n\navailable to the FDIC.  Moreover, 12 U.S.C.   1823(e), as amended\n\nby the  Financial Institutions Recovery,  Reform, and Enforcement\n\nAct of 1989 (FIRREA), which  codifies the D'Oench doctrine,  also\n                                                 \n\nrequires all agreements to be reflected in a bank's records.  \n\n          The section provides that:\n\n          [N]o  agreement which  tends  to diminish  or\n          defeat  the interest of the [Receiver] in any\n          asset acquired by it under  this section 1821\n          . . .  shall be valid against  the [Receiver]\n          unless such agreement --\n\n          (1)  is in writing,\n\n          (2)     was   executed   by  the   depository\n          institution  and   any  person   claiming  an\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\n          adverse  interest  thereunder,  including the\n          obligor,    contemporaneously    with     the\n          acquisition of  the asset  by the  depository\n          institution,\n\n          (3) was approved by the board of directors of\n          the  depository   institution  or   its  loan\n          committee, which approval  shall be reflected\n          in the  minutes of  said board  or committee,\n          and\n\n          (4) has  been, continuously, from the time of\n          its  execution,  an  official record  of  the\n          depository institution.\n\n12 U.S.C.    1823(e) (1989).   This section  requires categorical\n\ncompliance.  Beighley v. FDIC, 868 F.2d 776, 783 (5th Cir. 1989).\n                             \n\n          Carr's claim that the officers  of the Bank had  orally\n\nagreed  not  to  require payment  of  the  extension  upon Carr's\n\nacceptance of the extension commitment, but to defer it until the\n\nrefinancing of  his large loan,  constitutes the very kind  of an\n\nassertion  that the  D'Oench  doctrine and  12  U.S.C.    1823(e)\n                            \n\nproscribe.  See Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 95 (1987).  \n                               \n\n          Inasmuch as  the record  fails to  establish that  Carr\n\nentered  into any  agreement,  except the  unfulfilled  extension\n\ncommitment,  which in any way  complied with federal statutory or\n\ncommon law, his claims are barred.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          The  second  arrow in  Carr's  quiver is  aimed  at the\n\nBank's conduct  in connection  with the foreclosure  sale of  the\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nMarshfield  property.   Carr  claims  that  the  gap between  the\n\nappraised value  of this property  and the price obtained  at the\n\nforeclosure sale raises serious questions of material fact as  to\n\nwhether  the  sale   was  conducted  in  good  faith   and  in  a\n\ncommercially reasonable  manner.  Under such  circumstances, Carr\n\nasserts  that the district court  should not have granted summary\n\njudgment.   The district court  found that \"Carr cannot,  and has\n\nnot, complained that there  were procedural or notice defects  in\n\nthe foreclosure.\"   Carr's sole  complaint on appeal is  that the\n\nprice obtained was inadequate.   He therefore argues in a general\n\nway  that a  genuine issue  of material  fact exists  as  to \"the\n\ncommercial  reasonableness   and  good  faith  employed   in  the\n\nforeclosure sale.\"  \n\n          Carr neither alleges nor has  he proven that he did not\n\nreceive  adequate  notice   of  the  sale   or  that  there   was\n\ninsufficient public notice of the  forthcoming sale in the  press\n\nor that  the Bank acted  collusively, or did anything  to depress\n\nthe price prior to  or at the sale.  In short,  he does not claim\n\nthat the  foreclosure  sale was  conducted  in violation  of  any\n\napplicable law.  Rather, he relies entirely on the affidavit of a\n\nreal estate  appraiser whom he commissioned, who  placed the fair\n\nmarket value  of the  property at $350,000  on January  11, 1990,\n\napproximately  four months before the sale.   Carr's counsel sent\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nthe appraisal to the Bank.  Carr also points to the  Bank minutes\n\nof  September 6,  1989,  which reflected  an  appraisal value  of\n\n$325,000  for the  property.    However, on  March  29, 1990,  an\n\nappraisal  conducted  for   the  Bank  a  few   days  before  the\n\nforeclosure showed a value of $195,000.\n\n          The threshold question is what law governs this issue -\n\n- state  or federal  law.   Neither  the D'Oench  doctrine nor   \n                                                \n\n1823(e) bars the  assertion of a claim  or defense that  does not\n\ndepend on  an agreement; they  protect federal banks and  the RTC\n\nfrom  alleged oral  agreements  that  are not  part  of the  loan\n\nrecord.

This  second issue  only pertains  to the\n\npropriety of the foreclosure sale in the state court.\n\n          We  believe that state  law governs this  issue because\n\nthe Bank foreclosed  the property under state  court proceedings.\n\nThe  property  was   not  involved  in  any   federal  bankruptcy\n\nproceedings.   See  id. at  982 (applying  state law  to wrongful\n                       \n\nforeclosure claim).   The district court relied on  state law, as\n\ndoes Carr, and so do we.

In canvassing Massachusetts case  law, we\n\nfind ample  suggestion that a price  deficiency of as much  as 39\n\npercent  of fair  market  value  can support  the  granting of  a\n\ndispositive  motion.

Thus,  whatever the hypothetical boundaries  of \"gross\n\ninadequacy\"   under   Massachusetts   law,  Carr's   56   percent\n\ndifferential,  standing   alone,  could  not   ward  off  summary\n\njudgment.\n\n          As  to Carr's  contention of  lack  of good  faith, the\n\nrecord shows no evidence of  it on the part of the Bank  and Carr\n\npoints to none.   Carr knew for many months before  the sale that\n\nforeclosure was imminent.  Payment  of his note was due September\n\n1, 1989.  On August 22, 1989,  he wrote to the Bank requesting an\n\nextension  of one  year.   The  Bank obliged  subject to  certain\n\nconditions  which   were  acceptable   to   Carr.     Thereafter,\n\nnegotiations  between the parties ensued for several months which\n\nwere inconclusive, and  the conditions of the  proposed extension\n\nwere  never  fulfilled  by  Carr.   The  Bank  did  not  commence\n\nforeclosure until  November 30,  1989, and  it was  not concluded\n\nuntil  the sale  on April 5,  1990.   Carr had  all this  time to\n\neither pay  the note,  refinance elsewhere,  or especially  as an\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\nexperienced  businessman and  real  estate developer,  produce  a\n\nbuyer who would pay the price he aspired to achieve.\n\n          On the  other hand,  the Bank  had non-performing  real\n\nestate  on  hand which  required  disposition.   As  a  pragmatic\n\nmatter,  a bank  with  non-performing assets  may  not hold  them\n\nindefinitely until  it canvasses  an amorphous  public market  in\n\nsearch  of potential purchasers  who will pay  a theoretical fair\n\nmarket  value, lest  they  too succumb  to  claims of  creditors.\n\nHere, the Bank gave Carr every reasonable opportunity to meet his\n\nobligation or produce a buyer.  He did neither of these.  \n\n          It  is common  knowledge  in the  real  world that  the\n\npotential  price to  be realized  from the  sale of  real estate,\n\nparticularly in a  recessionary period,  usually is  considerably\n\nlower when sold \"under the hammer\" than the price obtainable when\n\nit is sold by an owner not under distress and who is able to sell\n\nat  his convenience  and to  wait until  a purchaser  reaches his\n\nprice.   Carr has  not met  his burden  of proof  of showing  bad\n\nfaith.  Under Massachusetts law, inadequacy  of the selling price\n\n\"without more,  would not show  bad faith or lack  of diligence.\"\n\nWest Roxbury Co-op Bank v. Bowser, 324  Mass. 489, 493, 87 N.E.2d\n                                 \n\n113, 115 (1949).  \n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\n          The  district court  also rejected  Carr's  claim of  a\n\nfiduciary duty owed to him, finding that \"[t]he relationship here\n\nis clearly creditor and borrower.\"  We agree.\n\n          Carr also turns to two  cases decided under the Federal\n\nBankruptcy Code  (Code), 11 U.S.C.    548 (1988), to  support his\n\ncontention that the sale was commercially unreasonable and in bad\n\nfaith.   He  argues  that  under the  Code  the foreclosure  sale\n\nconstituted a fraudulent transfer because the price obtained fell\n\nbelow the fair market value.  He  cites In re General Industries,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 79 B.R. 124, 134 (Bankr. D.

These cases  arise in\n\nthe context of federal bankruptcy proceedings where the debtor is\n\nin bankruptcy and the official  creditors committee sought to set\n\naside  the foreclosure sales contending that they were fraudulent\n\ntransfers under   548(a) of the Code because the  sales were made\n\nfor less than reasonably equivalent  value within the meaning  of\n\nthe statute.  The bankruptcy courts held that legal notice of the\n\nforeclosure  sale without  other substantial  advertising of  the\n\nproposed  sale in the general press was insufficient to withstand\n\nthe  fraudulent conveyance  strictures  of  the  Code.    General\n                                                                 \n\nIndustries,  79  B.R. at  134;  Ruebeck,  55  B.R. at  168.    In\n                                       \n\naddition,  the courts  held that  sales  at 53  percent and  57.7\n\npercent of fair market value were not reasonably equivalent value\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nwithin the meaning of   548.

Moreover, under the facts and conflicting\n\nevidence  of this  case, we  cannot say  that Carr  has proven  a\n\nfraudulent transfer of property merely because the price obtained\n\nat a fairly  conducted, non-collusive public foreclosure  sale in\n\naccordance  with   applicable  state   law  did   not  meet   his\n\nexpectations of the value  fixed by his  appraiser.  We need  not\n\ndecide whether advertising  of a foreclosure sale  in the general\n\npress is essential for a good faith sale in Massachusetts because\n\nnotice of the sale is not an issue before us.  We also believe it\n\nsignificant that the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court in General\n                                                                 \n\nIndustries  and   Ruebeck  were  ignored   by  the  Massachusetts\n                         \n\nlegislature when  it amended  the  State's fraudulent  conveyance\n\nstatute in 1989.  The statute now provides that \n\n          [F]air consideration is given for property or\n          obligation -- \n\n          (c) When property  is received pursuant  to a\n          regularly conducted, noncollusive foreclosure\n          sale or execution of a power of  sale for the\n          acquisition or  disposition of  such property\n          upon default under a  mortgage, deed or trust\n          or security agreement.\n\nMass.

We see\n                                                        \n\nno error in the application  of Massachusetts law by the district\n\ncourt and in entering judgment in the RTC's favor.\n\n                                V.\n\n          In summary,  we  hold  that the  minutes  of  a  bank's\n\nexecutive committee, which merely record the authorization of the\n\nBoard  to  the  bank's  officers  to extend  a  loan  on  certain\n\nconditions, do not  constitute a contract between a  bank and the\n\nborrower.    Furthermore,  alleged oral  assurances  of federally\n\nchartered bank officers  to defer compliance with  the conditions\n\nattached  to a proposed  extension of a  bank loan  are barred by\n\nfederal common  law under  D'Oench, Duhme,  and by  Congressional\n                                         \n\nstatute, 12 U.S.C.   1823(e).  Finally, under  Massachusetts law,\n\nmere inadequacy  of the sale  price of real estate  received at a\n\nnon-collusive  foreclosure sale conducted in full compliance with\n\nstate law  does not constitute a  breach of the covenant  of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing and is not an indication that the sale was\n\ncommercially unreasonable.  \n\n          The judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.

The malaise apparently not only adversely affected the appellant, Michael F. Carr, a real estate developer, but also the Home Federal Savings Bank (the Bank) from whom he borrowed a substantial sum of money.  The Bank foreclosed on an unimproved ocean lot Carr mortgaged to it.  Ultimately, the Bank also failed.  The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC/Receiver) became its Receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC succeeded the Bank as plaintiff in an action brought by the Bank, a federally chartered savings association organized under the laws of the United States, in the Worcester Superior Court of Massachusetts against Carr.  The Bank sued to recover a deficiency on a promissory note executed by Carr as evidence of a loan from the Bank in 1988 for $243,000, secured with a first mortgage on property located in Marshfield, Massachusetts.  While this litigation was in process, Carr filed a complaint in the state court for Middlesex County, Massachusetts, alleging wrongful foreclosure on the property securing the note.  The court consolidated the actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC/Receiver removed the cases to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and then moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion by order dated March 29, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Carr timely appealed to this court.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr obtained a first mortgage loan from the Bank on his property at 45 Old Beach Road, Marshfield, Massachusetts, on August 16, 1988.  Shortly before the maturity of the note on September 1, 1989, Carr requested of the Bank a one year extension.  The Bank's Executive Committee approved the extension subject to a number of conditions, including the payment by Carr of a one percent extension fee in the amount of $2,430.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank notified Carr of the proposed extension and its conditions by letter dated September 13, 1989.  The letter provided that the commitment to extend \"shall expire on October 16, 1989, and that a modification agreement must be executed on or before such date.\"   The letter also required that the commitment be accepted and returned no later than September 22, 1989, together with Carr's check for $2,430.  Accordingly, Carr affixed his signature in acceptance of the letter on September 20, 1989, and tendered the required check.  The check, however, was returned for insufficient funds.  Thereafter, Carr neither paid the extension fee nor executed the required modification agreement.  The minutes of the Executive Committee approving the extension of the loan and fixing the extension fee made no mention of a date for the payment of the extension fee or any details pertaining to the implementation of the extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the RTC's interrogatories, Carr testified that he advised the Bank's counsel in late September or early October 1989 that he had another loan with the Bank for $1,500,000 which he expected to refinance at the end of October, and that counsel agreed that payment of the extension fee could be deferred until the refinancing of his other loan.  He further testified that sometime after October 24, 1989, he spoke to Paul Engstrom, Jr., a senior loan counselor of the Bank, he advised Engstrom of the upcoming closing on the $1,500,000 loan, and Engstrom orally agreed to defer payment due under the extension until that closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 1989, the Bank informed Carr that his extension fee, as well as his monthly payment checks on the note, had been returned for insufficient funds.  The Bank demanded payment of the total arrearage and the extension fee by October 30, but as of November 16, 1989, Carr had not responded.  On November 17, 1989, payment not having been made, the Bank made formal demand under the defaulted promissory note.  Negotiations between Carr and the Bank again ensued but they reached no agreement.  The Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings and ultimately purchased the mortgaged land in April 1990 at the foreclosure sale for $195,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his action in the Middlesex Court, Carr asserted that the Bank actually had agreed to extend the due date of the note for one year, from September 1, 1989, to September 1, 1990, but the terms were changed in the preparation of the extension draft.  Carr further claimed that the September 1989 minutes of the Bank reflected an appraisal of the Marshfield property at $325,000 and that Carr's appraiser subsequently valued it at $350,000.  Carr therefore sought relief because of a wrongful foreclosure in the face of an agreement to extend the note to September 1, 1990, unjust enrichment to the Bank, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and failure to conduct the foreclosure sale in a commercially reasonable manner.  He also sought reconveyance of the property.  In addition, he filed a counterclaim in the consolidated actions in the Worcester Court substantially identical to his complaint in the Middlesex Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after the RTC removed the case to federal court, granted the RTC's motion for summary judgment in the consolidated matters based on the undisputed record, including a Statement of Undisputed Facts, affidavits, and other supporting documentation filed by the RTC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal issues raised on appeal by Carr are:  (1) The Bank agreed to extend the maturity date of the $243,000 note.  (2) The gap between the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the price obtained at foreclosure sale barred summary judgment against him for the deficiency because there were genuine issues of material fact whether the foreclosure sale was conducted in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary judgment may only be entered \"if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\"   In reviewing a summary judgment order entered by a district court, this court has plenary powers.

The court, in making its review, must \"look at the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment and accept all reasonable inferences favorable to such party arising from the record.\"  Id. at 45 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr first argues that the minutes of the Executive Committee did not refer to a date for closing or for payment of the extension fee and that the deadlines in the commitment letter \"were not conditions of the loan extension approved in the Executive Committee minutes.\"   Therefore, he asserts that in light of the difference between the minutes and the language of the extension commitment, and his affidavit that the Bank officers had orally agreed to defer payment of the extension fee until the closing of the refinancing of the $1,500,000 loan, summary judgment was inappropriate.  This argument is disingenuous and has no merit whatsoever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Executive Committee records reveal an approval of a request for a one year extension of the loan subject to a number of conditions.  Among the conditions for the extension were the requirements that an extension fee be paid and that the loan be kept current.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, the Executive Committee did not spell out the mechanics and language of the extension agreement, for such administrative details ordinarily are left to bank officers.  In this instance, the officers unequivocally provided for the payment of the extension fee of $2,430 \"upon acceptance of this commitment.\"   Carr made no objection to the terms and conditions of the commitment and signed his acceptance of it a week after the Executive Committee had approved the extension.  He then tendered his check in payment of the fee.  Thus, even Carr recognized by his execution of the letter of commitment that it, and not the minutes, constituted his agreement with the Bank.  His check, however, was returned for insufficient funds and he never paid this fee.  The commitment also required, in accordance with the recommendation to the Executive Committee, that Carr bring his loan current and supply the Bank with additional updated financial information.  Additionally, the commitment letter stated other details with respect to closing costs and expenses and title examination.  Carr agreed to its terms but never fulfilled any of the extension requirements after accepting them, including the execution of the required modification agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr reaches for a straw when he attempts to carve out a contract from the corporation minutes.  The minute book of a corporation is only a brief record of the corporate proceedings.  5A William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations Sec. 2190 (Perm. ed. rev. vol. 1987).  Here, it is merely an internal record which memorializes authority to the Bank's officers to grant an extension of Carr's loan.  The minutes, which of course were never \"executed\" by Carr, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(2) (1989), infra, do not purport to be an agreement with him.  They in no way reflect any intention on the part of the Executive Committee to defer payment of the extension fee until the refinancing of the $1,500,000 loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Carr's reliance on an alleged oral supplemental agreement with a bank officer is misplaced.  In D'Oench, Duhme and Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942), the Supreme Court first enunciated the common law doctrine that the FDIC is protected from unrecorded or oral agreements that are not reflected in one of its insured bank's records.  Id. at 461, 62 S.Ct. at 681.   The D'Oench doctrine bars defenses as well as affirmative claims against the FDIC.  Timberland Design Inc. v. First Service Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1991).  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(b), which establishes the RTC, and 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(b)(4), the RTC possesses the same rights and powers as are available to the FDIC.  Moreover, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e), as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), which codifies the D'Oench doctrine, also requires all agreements to be reflected in a bank's records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The section provides that:[N]o agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [Receiver] in any asset acquired by it under this section or section 1821 ... shall be valid against the [Receiver] unless such agreement--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) is in writing,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) (1989).  This section requires categorical compliance.  Beighley v. FDIC, 868 F.2d 776, 783 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr's claim that the officers of the Bank had orally agreed not to require payment of the extension upon Carr's acceptance of the extension commitment, but to defer it until the refinancing of his large loan, constitutes the very kind of an assertion that the D'Oench doctrine and 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) proscribe.  See Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 95, 108 S.Ct. 396, 403, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987).  Inasmuch as the record fails to establish that Carr entered into any agreement, except the unfulfilled extension commitment, which in any way complied with federal statutory or common law, his claims are barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second arrow in Carr's quiver is aimed at the Bank's conduct in connection with the foreclosure sale of the Marshfield property.  Carr claims that the gap between the appraised value of this property and the price obtained at the foreclosure sale raises serious questions of material fact as to whether the sale was conducted in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.  Under such circumstances, Carr asserts that the district court should not have granted summary judgment.  The district court found that \"Carr cannot, and has not, complained that there were procedural or notice defects in the foreclosure.\"   Carr's sole complaint on appeal is that the price obtained was inadequate.  He therefore argues in a general way that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to \"the commercial reasonableness and good faith employed in the foreclosure sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr neither alleges nor has he proven that he did not receive adequate notice of the sale or that there was insufficient public notice of the forthcoming sale in the press or that the Bank acted collusively, or did anything to depress the price prior to or at the sale.  In short, he does not claim that the foreclosure sale was conducted in violation of any applicable law.  Rather, he relies entirely on the affidavit of a real estate appraiser whom he commissioned, who placed the fair market value of the property at $350,000 on January 11, 1990, approximately four months before the sale.  Carr's counsel sent the appraisal to the Bank.  Carr also points to the Bank minutes of September 6, 1989, which reflected an appraisal value of $325,000 for the property.  However, on March 29, 1990, an appraisal conducted for the Bank a few days before the foreclosure showed a value of $195,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question is what law governs this issue--state or federal law.  Neither the D'Oench doctrine nor Sec. 1823(e) bars the assertion of a claim or defense that does not depend on an agreement;  they protect federal banks and the RTC from alleged oral agreements that are not part of the loan record.  Texas Refrigeration Supply Inc. v. FDIC, 953 F.2d 975, 981 (5th Cir.1992).  This second issue only pertains to the propriety of the foreclosure sale in the state court.  We believe that state law governs this issue because the Bank foreclosed the property under state court proceedings.  The property was not involved in any federal bankruptcy proceedings.  See id. at 982 (applying state law to wrongful foreclosure claim).  The district court relied on state law, as does Carr, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts state law, Carr has the burden of proving commercial unreasonableness, Chartrand v. Newton Trust Co., 296 Mass. 317, 320, 5 N.E.2d 421, 423 (1936), which is a question of fact, John Deere Leasing Co. v. Fraker, 395 N.W.2d 885, 887 (Iowa 1986).  Absent evidence of bad faith or improper conduct, a mortgagee is permitted to buy the collateral at a foreclosure sale as \"cheaply\" as it can, Cambridge Sav. Bank v. Cronin, 289 Mass. 379, 383, 194 N.E. 289, 290 (1936), and \"[m]ere inadequacy of price will not invalidate a sale unless it is so gross as to indicate bad faith or lack of reasonable diligence,\" Chartrand, 296 Mass. at 320, 5 N.E.2d at 423 (emphasis added).  Carr alleges that the Bank paid only 56 percent of the property's fair market value ($350,000), but produced no other evidence of bad faith or improper conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To warrant summary judgment for RTC, therefore, it would have to be shown that no reasonable factfinder, crediting Carr's appraisal of $350,000, could find the $195,000 sales price \"grossly\" inadequate.  In canvassing Massachusetts case law, we find ample suggestion that a price deficiency of as much as 39 percent of fair market value can support the granting of a dispositive motion.  See Sher v. South Shore Nat'l Bank, 360 Mass. 400, 402, 274 N.E.2d 792 (1971) (disparity between price of $35,500 and alleged fair market value of $52,500, i.e. a 67 percent sale, was \"not so gross\" as to withstand a motion to dismiss);  Atlas Mortgage Co. v. Tebaldi, 304 Mass. 554, 558, 24 N.E.2d 554 (1939) (disparity between price of $13,000 and alleged fair market value of $18,000, i.e. 72 percent sale, not \"so great\" as to defeat a directed verdict for mortgagee);  DesLauries v. Shea, 300 Mass. 30, 34-35, 13 N.E.2d 932 (1938) (disparity between price of $16,815 and fair market value of $25,500, i.e. 65 percent sale, permitted directed verdict for Bank);  Cambridge Sav. Bank, 289 Mass. at 383, 194 N.E. at 291 (disparity between price of $20,000 and alleged fair market value of $51,000, i.e. 39 percent sale, warrants directed verdict).  Thus, whatever the hypothetical boundaries of \"gross inadequacy\" under Massachusetts law, Carr's 56 percent differential, standing alone, could not ward off summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Carr's contention of lack of good faith, the record shows no evidence of it on the part of the Bank and Carr points to none.  Carr knew for many months before the sale that foreclosure was imminent.  Payment of his note was due September 1, 1989.  On August 22, 1989, he wrote to the Bank requesting an extension of one year.  The Bank obliged subject to certain conditions which were acceptable to Carr.  Thereafter, negotiations between the parties ensued for several months which were inconclusive, and the conditions of the proposed extension were never fulfilled by Carr.  The Bank did not commence foreclosure until November 30, 1989, and it was not concluded until the sale on April 5, 1990.  Carr had all this time to either pay the note, refinance elsewhere, or especially as an experienced businessman and real estate developer, produce a buyer who would pay the price he aspired to achieve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Bank had non-performing real estate on hand which required disposition.  As a pragmatic matter, a bank with non-performing assets may not hold them indefinitely until it canvasses an amorphous public market in search of potential purchasers who will pay a theoretical fair market value, lest they too succumb to claims of creditors.  Here, the Bank gave Carr every reasonable opportunity to meet his obligation or produce a buyer.  He did neither of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common knowledge in the real world that the potential price to be realized from the sale of real estate, particularly in a recessionary period, usually is considerably lower when sold \"under the hammer\" than the price obtainable when it is sold by an owner not under distress and who is able to sell at his convenience and to wait until a purchaser reaches his price.  Carr has not met his burden of proof of showing bad faith.  Under Massachusetts law, inadequacy of the selling price \"without more, would not show bad faith or lack of diligence.\"  West Roxbury Co-op Bank v. Bowser, 324 Mass. 489, 493, 87 N.E.2d 113, 115 (1949).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected Carr's claim of a fiduciary duty owed to him, finding that \"[t]he relationship here is clearly creditor and borrower.\"   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr also turns to two cases decided under the Federal Bankruptcy Code (Code), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 548 (1988), to support his contention that the sale was commercially unreasonable and in bad faith.  He argues that under the Code the foreclosure sale constituted a fraudulent transfer because the price obtained fell below the fair market value.  He cites In re General Industries, Inc., 79 B.R. 124, 134 (Bankr.D.Mass.1987), and In re Ruebeck, 55 B.R. 163, 171 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985).  These cases arise in the context of federal bankruptcy proceedings where the debtor is in bankruptcy and the official creditors committee sought to set aside the foreclosure sales contending that they were fraudulent transfers under Sec. 548(a) of the Code because the sales were made for less than reasonably equivalent value within the meaning of the statute.  The bankruptcy courts held that legal notice of the foreclosure sale without other substantial advertising of the proposed sale in the general press was insufficient to withstand the fraudulent conveyance strictures of the Code.  General Industries, 79 B.R. at 134;  Ruebeck, 55 B.R. at 168.   In addition, the courts held that sales at 53 percent and 57.7 percent of fair market value were not reasonably equivalent value within the meaning of Sec. 548.  General Industries, 79 B.R. at 134;  Ruebeck, 55 B.R. at 171.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr, however, is not a debtor within the meaning of the Code and the cases he cites are therefore inapplicable in the context of this case.  Moreover, under the facts and conflicting evidence of this case, we cannot say that Carr has proven a fraudulent transfer of property merely because the price obtained at a fairly conducted, non-collusive public foreclosure sale in accordance with applicable state law did not meet his expectations of the value fixed by his appraiser.  We need not decide whether advertising of a foreclosure sale in the general press is essential for a good faith sale in Massachusetts because notice of the sale is not an issue before us.  We also believe it significant that the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court in General Industries and Ruebeck were ignored by the Massachusetts legislature when it amended the State's fraudulent conveyance statute in 1989.  The statute now provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[F]air consideration is given for property or obligation--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>(c) When property is received pursuant to a regularly conducted, noncollusive foreclosure sale or execution of a power of sale for the acquisition or disposition of such property upon default under a mortgage, deed or trust or security agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 109A, Sec. 3 (West 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Massachusetts legislature did not adopt the principles set forth in General Industries or in Ruebeck.   We see no error in the application of Massachusetts law by the district court and in entering judgment in the RTC's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we hold that the minutes of a bank's executive committee, which merely record the authorization of the Board to the bank's officers to extend a loan on certain conditions, do not constitute a contract between a bank and the borrower.  Furthermore, alleged oral assurances of federally chartered bank officers to defer compliance with the conditions attached to a proposed extension of a bank loan are barred by federal common law under D'Oench and by Congressional statute, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e).  Finally, under Massachusetts law, mere inadequacy of the sale price of real estate received at a non-collusive foreclosure sale conducted in full compliance with state law does not constitute a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and is not an indication that the sale was commercially unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

The malaise apparently not only adversely affected the appellant, Michael F. Carr, a real estate developer, but also the Home Federal Savings Bank (the Bank) from whom he borrowed a substantial sum of money.  The Bank foreclosed on an unimproved ocean lot Carr mortgaged to it.  Ultimately, the Bank also failed.  The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC/Receiver) became its Receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC succeeded the Bank as plaintiff in an action brought by the Bank, a federally chartered savings association organized under the laws of the United States, in the Worcester Superior Court of Massachusetts against Carr.  The Bank sued to recover a deficiency on a promissory note executed by Carr as evidence of a loan from the Bank in 1988 for $243,000, secured with a first mortgage on property located in Marshfield, Massachusetts.  While this litigation was in process, Carr filed a complaint in the state court for Middlesex County, Massachusetts, alleging wrongful foreclosure on the property securing the note.  The court consolidated the actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC/Receiver removed the cases to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and then moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion by order dated March 29, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Carr timely appealed to this court.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr obtained a first mortgage loan from the Bank on his property at 45 Old Beach Road, Marshfield, Massachusetts, on August 16, 1988.  Shortly before the maturity of the note on September 1, 1989, Carr requested of the Bank a one year extension.  The Bank's Executive Committee approved the extension subject to a number of conditions, including the payment by Carr of a one percent extension fee in the amount of $2,430.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank notified Carr of the proposed extension and its conditions by letter dated September 13, 1989.  The letter provided that the commitment to extend \"shall expire on October 16, 1989, and that a modification agreement must be executed on or before such date.\"   The letter also required that the commitment be accepted and returned no later than September 22, 1989, together with Carr's check for $2,430.  Accordingly, Carr affixed his signature in acceptance of the letter on September 20, 1989, and tendered the required check.  The check, however, was returned for insufficient funds.  Thereafter, Carr neither paid the extension fee nor executed the required modification agreement.  The minutes of the Executive Committee approving the extension of the loan and fixing the extension fee made no mention of a date for the payment of the extension fee or any details pertaining to the implementation of the extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the RTC's interrogatories, Carr testified that he advised the Bank's counsel in late September or early October 1989 that he had another loan with the Bank for $1,500,000 which he expected to refinance at the end of October, and that counsel agreed that payment of the extension fee could be deferred until the refinancing of his other loan.  He further testified that sometime after October 24, 1989, he spoke to Paul Engstrom, Jr., a senior loan counselor of the Bank, he advised Engstrom of the upcoming closing on the $1,500,000 loan, and Engstrom orally agreed to defer payment due under the extension until that closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 1989, the Bank informed Carr that his extension fee, as well as his monthly payment checks on the note, had been returned for insufficient funds.  The Bank demanded payment of the total arrearage and the extension fee by October 30, but as of November 16, 1989, Carr had not responded.  On November 17, 1989, payment not having been made, the Bank made formal demand under the defaulted promissory note.  Negotiations between Carr and the Bank again ensued but they reached no agreement.  The Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings and ultimately purchased the mortgaged land in April 1990 at the foreclosure sale for $195,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his action in the Middlesex Court, Carr asserted that the Bank actually had agreed to extend the due date of the note for one year, from September 1, 1989, to September 1, 1990, but the terms were changed in the preparation of the extension draft.  Carr further claimed that the September 1989 minutes of the Bank reflected an appraisal of the Marshfield property at $325,000 and that Carr's appraiser subsequently valued it at $350,000.  Carr therefore sought relief because of a wrongful foreclosure in the face of an agreement to extend the note to September 1, 1990, unjust enrichment to the Bank, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and failure to conduct the foreclosure sale in a commercially reasonable manner.  He also sought reconveyance of the property.  In addition, he filed a counterclaim in the consolidated actions in the Worcester Court substantially identical to his complaint in the Middlesex Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after the RTC removed the case to federal court, granted the RTC's motion for summary judgment in the consolidated matters based on the undisputed record, including a Statement of Undisputed Facts, affidavits, and other supporting documentation filed by the RTC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal issues raised on appeal by Carr are:  (1) The Bank agreed to extend the maturity date of the $243,000 note.

This argument is disingenuous and has no merit whatsoever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Executive Committee records reveal an approval of a request for a one year extension of the loan subject to a number of conditions.  Among the conditions for the extension were the requirements that an extension fee be paid and that the loan be kept current.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, the Executive Committee did not spell out the mechanics and language of the extension agreement, for such administrative details ordinarily are left to bank officers.  In this instance, the officers unequivocally provided for the payment of the extension fee of $2,430 \"upon acceptance of this commitment.\"   Carr made no objection to the terms and conditions of the commitment and signed his acceptance of it a week after the Executive Committee had approved the extension.  He then tendered his check in payment of the fee.  Thus, even Carr recognized by his execution of the letter of commitment that it, and not the minutes, constituted his agreement with the Bank.  His check, however, was returned for insufficient funds and he never paid this fee.  The commitment also required, in accordance with the recommendation to the Executive Committee, that Carr bring his loan current and supply the Bank with additional updated financial information.  Additionally, the commitment letter stated other details with respect to closing costs and expenses and title examination.  Carr agreed to its terms but never fulfilled any of the extension requirements after accepting them, including the execution of the required modification agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr reaches for a straw when he attempts to carve out a contract from the corporation minutes.  The minute book of a corporation is only a brief record of the corporate proceedings.  5A William M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations Sec. 2190 (Perm. ed. rev. vol. 1987).  Here, it is merely an internal record which memorializes authority to the Bank's officers to grant an extension of Carr's loan.  The minutes, which of course were never \"executed\" by Carr, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(2) (1989), infra, do not purport to be an agreement with him.  They in no way reflect any intention on the part of the Executive Committee to defer payment of the extension fee until the refinancing of the $1,500,000 loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Carr's reliance on an alleged oral supplemental agreement with a bank officer is misplaced.

Inasmuch as the record fails to establish that Carr entered into any agreement, except the unfulfilled extension commitment, which in any way complied with federal statutory or common law, his claims are barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second arrow in Carr's quiver is aimed at the Bank's conduct in connection with the foreclosure sale of the Marshfield property.  Carr claims that the gap between the appraised value of this property and the price obtained at the foreclosure sale raises serious questions of material fact as to whether the sale was conducted in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.  Under such circumstances, Carr asserts that the district court should not have granted summary judgment.  The district court found that \"Carr cannot, and has not, complained that there were procedural or notice defects in the foreclosure.\"   Carr's sole complaint on appeal is that the price obtained was inadequate.  He therefore argues in a general way that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to \"the commercial reasonableness and good faith employed in the foreclosure sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr neither alleges nor has he proven that he did not receive adequate notice of the sale or that there was insufficient public notice of the forthcoming sale in the press or that the Bank acted collusively, or did anything to depress the price prior to or at the sale.  In short, he does not claim that the foreclosure sale was conducted in violation of any applicable law.  Rather, he relies entirely on the affidavit of a real estate appraiser whom he commissioned, who placed the fair market value of the property at $350,000 on January 11, 1990, approximately four months before the sale.  Carr's counsel sent the appraisal to the Bank.  Carr also points to the Bank minutes of September 6, 1989, which reflected an appraisal value of $325,000 for the property.  However, on March 29, 1990, an appraisal conducted for the Bank a few days before the foreclosure showed a value of $195,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question is what law governs this issue--state or federal law.  Neither the D'Oench doctrine nor Sec. 1823(e) bars the assertion of a claim or defense that does not depend on an agreement;  they protect federal banks and the RTC from alleged oral agreements that are not part of the loan record.

This second issue only pertains to the propriety of the foreclosure sale in the state court.  We believe that state law governs this issue because the Bank foreclosed the property under state court proceedings.  The property was not involved in any federal bankruptcy proceedings.  See id. at 982 (applying state law to wrongful foreclosure claim).

Thus, whatever the hypothetical boundaries of \"gross inadequacy\" under Massachusetts law, Carr's 56 percent differential, standing alone, could not ward off summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Carr's contention of lack of good faith, the record shows no evidence of it on the part of the Bank and Carr points to none.  Carr knew for many months before the sale that foreclosure was imminent.  Payment of his note was due September 1, 1989.  On August 22, 1989, he wrote to the Bank requesting an extension of one year.  The Bank obliged subject to certain conditions which were acceptable to Carr.  Thereafter, negotiations between the parties ensued for several months which were inconclusive, and the conditions of the proposed extension were never fulfilled by Carr.  The Bank did not commence foreclosure until November 30, 1989, and it was not concluded until the sale on April 5, 1990.  Carr had all this time to either pay the note, refinance elsewhere, or especially as an experienced businessman and real estate developer, produce a buyer who would pay the price he aspired to achieve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Bank had non-performing real estate on hand which required disposition.  As a pragmatic matter, a bank with non-performing assets may not hold them indefinitely until it canvasses an amorphous public market in search of potential purchasers who will pay a theoretical fair market value, lest they too succumb to claims of creditors.  Here, the Bank gave Carr every reasonable opportunity to meet his obligation or produce a buyer.  He did neither of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common knowledge in the real world that the potential price to be realized from the sale of real estate, particularly in a recessionary period, usually is considerably lower when sold \"under the hammer\" than the price obtainable when it is sold by an owner not under distress and who is able to sell at his convenience and to wait until a purchaser reaches his price.  Carr has not met his burden of proof of showing bad faith.  Under Massachusetts law, inadequacy of the selling price \"without more, would not show bad faith or lack of diligence.\"  West Roxbury Co-op Bank v. Bowser, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span>, 493, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></span>, 115 (1949).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected Carr's claim of a fiduciary duty owed to him, finding that \"[t]he relationship here is clearly creditor and borrower.\"   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr also turns to two cases decided under the Federal Bankruptcy Code (Code), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 548 (1988), to support his contention that the sale was commercially unreasonable and in bad faith.  He argues that under the Code the foreclosure sale constituted a fraudulent transfer because the price obtained fell below the fair market value.  He cites In re General Industries, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1948861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1948861/in-re-general-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 134 (Bankr.D.Mass.1987), and In re Ruebeck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1543932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1543932/in-re-ruebeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 171 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985).  These cases arise in the context of federal bankruptcy proceedings where the debtor is in bankruptcy and the official creditors committee sought to set aside the foreclosure sales contending that they were fraudulent transfers under Sec. 548(a) of the Code because the sales were made for less than reasonably equivalent value within the meaning of the statute.  The bankruptcy courts held that legal notice of the foreclosure sale without other substantial advertising of the proposed sale in the general press was insufficient to withstand the fraudulent conveyance strictures of the Code.  General Industries, 79 B.R. at 134;  Ruebeck, 55 B.R. at 168.   In addition, the courts held that sales at 53 percent and 57.7 percent of fair market value were not reasonably equivalent value within the meaning of Sec. 548.  General Industries, 79 B.R. at 134;  Ruebeck, 55 B.R. at 171.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carr, however, is not a debtor within the meaning of the Code and the cases he cites are therefore inapplicable in the context of this case.  Moreover, under the facts and conflicting evidence of this case, we cannot say that Carr has proven a fraudulent transfer of property merely because the price obtained at a fairly conducted, non-collusive public foreclosure sale in accordance with applicable state law did not meet his expectations of the value fixed by his appraiser.  We need not decide whether advertising of a foreclosure sale in the general press is essential for a good faith sale in Massachusetts because notice of the sale is not an issue before us.  We also believe it significant that the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court in General Industries and Ruebeck were ignored by the Massachusetts legislature when it amended the State's fraudulent conveyance statute in 1989.  The statute now provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[F]air consideration is given for property or obligation--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>(c) When property is received pursuant to a regularly conducted, noncollusive foreclosure sale or execution of a power of sale for the acquisition or disposition of such property upon default under a mortgage, deed or trust or security agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 109A, Sec. 3 (West 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Massachusetts legislature did not adopt the principles set forth in General Industries or in Ruebeck.

Furthermore, alleged oral assurances of federally chartered bank officers to defer compliance with the conditions attached to a proposed extension of a bank loan are barred by federal common law under D'Oench and by Congressional statute, 12 U.S.C.
