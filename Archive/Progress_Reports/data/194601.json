Charles  Merrill Mount  appeals  from  a\n                \n\ndistrict  court  order  denying  his  motion  for  return  of\n\n$18,400.  Following his  arrest for violation of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n2314,  those  funds were  seized  from a  safety  deposit box\n\nmaintained  by  Mount  in  the District  of  Columbia.    And\n\nfollowing his conviction, those funds were ordered to be paid\n\nin  restitution to  Goodspeed's,  the  antiquarian book  shop\n\nwhich  had suffered  a $20,000  loss as  a result  of Mount's\n\ncrimes.   There is ample  reason to believe  that the $18,400\n\nwas  the unspent balance of the very funds that had been paid\n\nby Goodspeed's  for historical  documents that Mount  did not\n\nown but had wrongly sold to Goodspeed's.\n\n     Mount now  argues that  all of the  historical documents\n\nwhich  he sold to Goodspeed's  were stricken from  Count I of\n\nthe  indictment at  trial, with  the result  that Goodspeed's\n\nsuffered  no  actual  loss  and  thus  was  not  entitled  to\n\nrestitution.   This contention is flatly  contradicted by the\n\nrecord.  See  United States  v.
