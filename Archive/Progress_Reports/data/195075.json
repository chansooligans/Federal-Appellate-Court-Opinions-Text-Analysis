This appeal requires us not only\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nto resolve defendant's  claim of multiplicitousness, but  also to\n\nanswer a question  of first impression in this circuit concerning\n\nthe special  assessment  mandated by  18  U.S.C.    3013  (1988).\n\nConcluding, as we do,  that the indictment is not  multiplicitous\n\nand  that the  court  below  appropriately  imposed  the  special\n\nassessment on  a \"per count\"  basis, rather than on  some broader\n\nbasis (say, \"per scheme\" or \"per defendant\"), we affirm.\n\n                                I\n                                 \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          The indictment  undergirding this  appeal stemmed  from\n\ndefendant-appellant  Thomas   Luongo's  communications   with  an\n\nelderly man, Albert Tompane, between August 1990  and April 1991.\n\nUsing  the name  Keith Symonds,  appellant  contacted Tompane  by\n\ntelephone for the  purpose of  soliciting money  in exchange  for\n\nlucre or  property  that appellant  promised  to provide  in  the\n\nfuture.  Appellant directed Tompane to send him funds by means of\n\nwire  transfers.     As  a  result,  Tompane   wired  money  from\n\nMassachusetts to Rhode  Island on numerous occasions.   Appellant\n\nthen pocketed the proceeds but  did not send Tompane the promised\n\nconsideration.\n\n          Shortly after  the grand  jury returned an  indictment,\n\nappellant pled guilty to fifty-seven  counts of wire fraud.1  The\n\n                    \n\n     1The original  indictment  charged  appellant  with  causing\nseventy-eight  unlawful  wire transfers,  involving  $45,525.   A\nsuperseding  indictment  charged  him  with  causing  fifty-seven\nunlawful  wire transfers.   At  the  change-of-plea hearing,  the\nprosecutor  stated  that  these  fifty-seven  transfers  involved\n\n                                2\n\ndistrict  court sentenced  him  to  serve  thirty-six  months  in\n\nprison, followed by thirty-six months of supervised release.  The\n\ncourt also  ordered him  to pay a  $2,850 special  assessment and\n\n$5,000  toward restitution.2   Luongo  appeals  from the  special\n\nassessment.\n\n                                II\n                                  \n\n                           Multiplicity\n                                       \n\n          Appellant's initial contention is that, notwithstanding\n\nhis  plea of  guilty to  fifty-seven counts  of wire  fraud,3 the\n\n                    \n\n$29,201.  The presentence report used the same dollar amount.  Be\nthat as it may, the  figures specified in the fifty-seven counts,\nwhen added together, aggregate $31,180.\n\n     2The court  levied the  special assessment  under a  statute\nthat reads in pertinent part:\n\n                         *      *      *\n\n          (a)  the  court  shall assess  on  any person\n          convicted of  an offense  against the  United\n          States  \n\n                         *      *      *\n\n             (2) in the case of a felony  \n\n               (a)  the  amount   of  $50  if  the\n               defendant is an individual; . . .\n\n18 U.S.C.    3013(a)  (1988).  In  this case, the  $2,850 special\nassessment  represents  the   $50  sum  mentioned  in   the  law,\nmultiplied by the fifty-seven counts of conviction.\n\n     3The statute of conviction provides in relevant part that:\n\n          Whoever, having devised  . . . any  scheme or\n          artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money .\n          .   .  by   means  of  false   or  fraudulent\n          pretenses,   representations,  or   promises,\n          transmits  or  causes  to  be transmitted  by\n          means   of  wire  .   .  .  communication  in\n          interstate or foreign commerce, any writings,\n          signs, signals, pictures,  or sounds for  the\n          purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,\n          shall be [punished as provided  by law] . . .\n\n                                3\n\nindictment   against  him  suffered   from  a  fatal   strain  of\n\nmultiplicity.    Consequently,  he maintains  that  his  offenses\n\namounted  to only  a single violation  of 18  U.S.C.    1343 and,\n\ntherefore, merit  only  a single  $50 special  assessment.   This\n\nclaim pirouettes  around our opinion  in United States  v. Lilly,\n                                                                \n\n983 F.2d 300 (1st Cir. 1992).4\n\n          In  Lilly, we held  an indictment charging  a defendant\n                   \n\nwith,  inter alia,  twenty-nine  counts of  bank  fraud under  18\n                 \n\nU.S.C.     1344  to  be  multiplicitous.    Since  the  defendant\n\ndefrauded a single bank of a single loan through a single scheme,\n\nalbeit by submitting twenty-nine false mortgages to the lender in\n\nperpetrating that  scheme, that  portion of  the indictment  \"was\n\nmore comfortably characterized as a single execution  of a scheme\n\nrather than as 20-some-odd separate executions of a scheme.\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 303.   Appellant asseverates that he, too,  defrauded a single\n\nvictim through a  single scheme, necessitating that we  merge the\n\nfifty-seven  counts in  the superseding  indictment and  construe\n\nthem as one.  We disagree.\n\n          The  principal flaw in appellant's construct is that he\n\nand Lilly were  charged under different statutes  and, therefore,\n\nthe cases are  not fair congeners.  Lilly dealt  with bank fraud,\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n          .\n\n18 U.S.C.   1343 (Supp. 1990).\n\n     4Appellant also  tries to  derive sustenance  from the  fact\nthat the lower court imposed a single 36-month prison term  and a\nunitary term of supervised release.  For our part, those features\nof  the  sentence do  not  portend  multiplicity.   Absent  clear\nlanguage indicating a contrary intent,  it is to be presumed that\nsentences imposed on more than one count  at the same time are to\nrun concurrently.   See, e.g., United States v.  Schulz, 384 F.2d\n                                                       \n374, 375 (5th Cir. 1967).\n\n                                4\n\nnot wire fraud.  This is no mere scrivener's discrepancy, for the\n\nLilly court held  that the bank fraud statute, 18  U.S.C.   1344,\n     \n\ncould not be construed in pari passu with the mail and wire fraud\n                                    \n\nstatutes, 18 U.S.C.    1341, 1343.  See  Lilly, 983 F.2d at 304 &amp;\n                                              \n\nn.8.  While the  former statute criminalizes only the  execution,\n\nor  attempted execution, of  a scheme to  defraud a bank,  see 18\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   1344  (rendering it unlawful for a  person to \"knowingly\n\nexecute[], or attempt[] to execute, a scheme or artifice . . . to\n\ndefraud   a   financial   institution\"),   the  latter   statutes\n\ncriminalize  specifically  enumerated actions,  e.g.,  interstate\n                                                    \n\nwire transmissions,  see 18 U.S.C.    1343, so  long as  any such\n                        \n\naction is for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud.  This\n\nsalient difference routs appellant's reliance on Lilly.5\n                                                      \n\n          Once   Lilly  is   placed   into  proper   perspective,\n                      \n\nappellant's multiplicity claim is easily dismantled.  \"It is well\n\nestablished that  each use  of the wires  constitutes a  separate\n\ncrime under  18 U.S.C.    1343, even if  the several uses  are in\n\npursuance of  but one  criminal  enterprise.\"   United States  v.\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     5Of course,  beyond  the  all-important  difference  between\nsection  1344's focus  on execution  of  a scheme  as opposed  to\n                                   \nsection  1343's focus on the individual (covered) acts undertaken\nin  executing the  scheme, there  are  also factual  distinctions\nbetween  Lilly and this  case.   Although appellant,  like Lilly,\n              \ndevised one scheme  to defraud one  victim, he procured  multiple\nsums of money through  multiple wire transfers.  Lilly,  however,\nengaged in one transaction with one bank, procuring one large sum\nof money in one loan   a set of facts critical to the analysis of\nthe  twenty-nine counts at  issue there.  See  Lilly, 983 F.2d at\n                                                    \n304.  We take no view on the purely hypothetical question  of how\nappellant's case might  fare if he, like Lilly,  had victimized a\nfinancial institution and had been charged with bank fraud rather\nthan wire fraud.\n\n                                5\n\nFermin Castillo,  829 F.2d 1194,  1199 (1st Cir. 1987).   Because\n               \n\neach of the fifty-seven counts laid against appellant  reflects a\n\ndistinct wire transfer  of funds, each count describes a separate\n\nviolation  of  18   U.S.C.     1343     even   if  the  transfers\n\ncollectively comprised  a single  execution of  a single  scheme.\n\nSee  id.; United States  v. Benmuhar, 658  F.2d 14, 21  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1981), cert. denied, 457  U.S. 1117 (1982).  On this point, Lilly\n                                                                 \n\ndoes not prop up appellant's  argument, but batters it, for Lilly\n                                                                 \n\nexpressly  reaffirms the Fermin  Castillo principle.   See Lilly,\n                                                                \n\n983 F.2d  at 303 n.7  (\"Courts have routinely construed  the mail\n\nand wire fraud statutes to criminalize each mailing or use of the\n\nwires.\").\n\n          For  these reasons,  we  conclude that  Lilly, properly\n                                                       \n\nread,  is  more bludgeon  than  crutch  so  far as  appellant  is\n\nconcerned.   It follows  that appellant's  multiplicity claim  is\n\nmeritless.  The counts of conviction need not be merged.6\n\n                               III\n                                  \n\n            Construing the Special Assessment Statute\n                                                     \n\n          The  second question  we must  confront  is whether  18\n\n                    \n\n     6Appellant suggests that the rule of lenity pertains in this\ncase because 18 U.S.C.    1343 does not specifically require that\na  defendant be punished for each  act in furtherance of a scheme\nto defraud.  But a criminal statute must be ambiguous before  the\nrule of lenity  becomes relevant.  See Bifulco  v. United States,\n                                                                \n447  U.S.  381,  387 (1980).    As  the  wire  fraud  statute  is\nunambiguous,  and  the  principle  that  each use  of  the  wires\nconstitutes a separate violation of section 1343 has  been widely\naccepted for many years, see, e.g., United States v. Calvert, 523\n                                                            \nF.2d 895,  903 n.6 (8th  Cir. 1975), cert.  denied, 424 U.S.  911\n                                                  \n(1976); United  States v. Henderson,  425 F.2d 134, 138  n.4 (5th\n                                   \nCir. 1970), we have no occasion to engage the rule of lenity.\n\n                                6\n\nU.S.C.   3013,  quoted supra note 2, required  the district court\n                            \n\nto  impose   the  monetary  equivalent  of   fifty-seven  special\n\nassessments in this case.  We think that it did.\n\n          We begin with bedrock.  When \"resolution  of a question\n\nof federal law turns on a statute  and the intention of Congress,\n\nwe  look  first  to  the  statutory  language  and  then  to  its\n\nlegislative  history if the statutory language is unclear.\"  Blum\n                                                                 \n\nv. Stenson, 465  U.S. 886, 896 (1984).  The statute at issue here\n          \n\nprovides  that  a  district  court  \"shall\"  impose  the  special\n\nassessment \"on any person convicted of  an offense.\"  18 U.S.C.  \n                                                  \n\n3013(a)  (emphasis  supplied);  see  also  id.  at     3013(a)(2)\n                                              \n\n(providing  for  the  assessment  \"in  the  case  of  a  felony\")\n                                                               \n\n(emphasis supplied).  This language admits of  only one plausible\n\nconstruction:  that a $50 special assessment must be imposed on a\n\ndefendant who  stands convicted  of a federal  offense that  is a\n\nfelony.  And because the statute is  phrased in the singular, its\n\nterms  imply  that  each offense     each felony     calls  for a\n\nseparate  special assessment,  even when  a  single defendant  is\n\nsimultaneously convicted of multiple charges.\n\n          The    legislative    history   suggests    the    same\n\ninterpretation.   The  statute was  enacted as  part of  the 1984\n\nComprehensive  Crime  Control  Act.    The  Senate  Report  which\n\naccompanied section 3013  states that \"[t]he purpose  of imposing\n\nnominal assessment fees is to  generate needed income\" to stock a\n\nvictims'  assistance fund, simultaneously  created.  S.  Rep. No.\n\n497,  98th Cong.,  2d Sess.  13, reprinted  in 1984  U.S.C.C.A.N.\n                                              \n\n                                7\n\n3607,  3619.

Sec. 3013 (1988).  Concluding, as we do, that the indictment is not multiplicitous and that the court below appropriately imposed the special assessment on a \"per count\" basis, rather than on some broader basis (say, \"per scheme\" or \"per defendant\"), we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment undergirding this appeal stemmed from defendant-appellant Thomas Luongo's communications with an elderly man, Albert Tompane, between August 1990 and April 1991.  Using the name Keith Symonds, appellant contacted Tompane by telephone for the purpose of soliciting money in exchange for lucre or property that appellant promised to provide in the future.  Appellant directed Tompane to send him funds by means of wire transfers.  As a result, Tompane wired money from Massachusetts to Rhode Island on numerous occasions.  Appellant then pocketed the proceeds but did not send Tompane the promised consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the grand jury returned an indictment, appellant pled guilty to fifty-seven counts of wire fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court sentenced him to serve thirty-six months in prison, followed by thirty-six months of supervised release.  The court also ordered him to pay a $2,850 special assessment and $5,000 toward restitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Luongo appeals from the special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Multiplicity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's initial contention is that, notwithstanding his plea of guilty to fifty-seven counts of wire fraud,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the indictment against him suffered from a fatal strain of multiplicity.  Consequently, he maintains that his offenses amounted to only a single violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 and, therefore, merit only a single $50 special assessment.  This claim pirouettes around our opinion in United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lilly, we held an indictment charging a defendant with, inter alia, twenty-nine counts of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344 to be multiplicitous.  Since the defendant defrauded a single bank of a single loan through a single scheme, albeit by submitting twenty-nine false mortgages to the lender in perpetrating that scheme, that portion of the indictment \"was more comfortably characterized as a single execution of a scheme rather than as 20-some-odd separate executions of a scheme.\"  Id. at 303.   Appellant asseverates that he, too, defrauded a single victim through a single scheme, necessitating that we merge the fifty-seven counts in the superseding indictment and construe them as one.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal flaw in appellant's construct is that he and Lilly were charged under different statutes and, therefore, the cases are not fair congeners.  Lilly dealt with bank fraud, not wire fraud.  This is no mere scrivener's discrepancy, for the Lilly court held that the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, could not be construed in pari passu with the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341, 1343.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 304 &amp; n. 8.   While the former statute criminalizes only the execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme to defraud a bank, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344 (rendering it unlawful for a person to \"knowingly execute[ ], or attempt[ ] to execute, a scheme or artifice ... to defraud a financial institution\"), the latter statutes criminalize specifically enumerated actions, e.g., interstate wire transmissions, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, so long as any such action is for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud.  This salient difference routs appellant's reliance on Lilly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Lilly is placed into proper perspective, appellant's multiplicity claim is easily dismantled.  \"It is well established that each use of the wires constitutes a separate crime under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, even if the several uses are in pursuance of but one criminal enterprise.\"  United States v. Fermin Castillo, 829 F.2d 1194, 1199 (1st Cir.1987).  Because each of the fifty-seven counts laid against appellant reflects a distinct wire transfer of funds, each count describes a separate violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343--even if the transfers collectively comprised a single execution of a single scheme.  See id.;  United States v. Benmuhar, 658 F.2d 14, 21 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 2927, 73 L.Ed.2d 1328 (1982).  On this point, Lilly does not prop up appellant's argument, but batters it, for Lilly expressly reaffirms the Fermin Castillo principle.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 303 n. 7 (\"Courts have routinely construed the mail and wire fraud statutes to criminalize each mailing or use of the wires.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that Lilly, properly read, is more bludgeon than crutch so far as appellant is concerned.  It follows that appellant's multiplicity claim is meritless.  The counts of conviction need not be merged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Construing the Special Assessment Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question we must confront is whether 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013, quoted supra note 2, required the district court to impose the monetary equivalent of fifty-seven special assessments in this case.  We think that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  When \"resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then to its legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\"  Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984).  The statute at issue here provides that a district court \"shall\" impose the special assessment \"on any person convicted of an offense.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013(a) (emphasis supplied);  see also id. at Sec. 3013(a)(2) (providing for the assessment \"in the case of a felony \") (emphasis supplied).  This language admits of only one plausible construction:  that a $50 special assessment must be imposed on a defendant who stands convicted of a federal offense that is a felony.  And because the statute is phrased in the singular, its terms imply that each offense--each felony--calls for a separate special assessment, even when a single defendant is simultaneously convicted of multiple charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history suggests the same interpretation.  The statute was enacted as part of the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act.  The Senate Report which accompanied section 3013 states that \"[t]he purpose of imposing nominal assessment fees is to generate needed income\" to stock a victims' assistance fund, simultaneously created.  S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3607, 3619.  Because the aim of section 3013 is to generate revenue, and because construing it according to the tenor of its text will maximize that goal, we are hard pressed to see how the statute can bear a contrary reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not pioneers in reaching the conclusion that, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013, a defendant convicted of multiple felonies is subject to multiple assessments.  Every court of appeals thus far to consider the question has ruled that the special assessment required by section 3013 must be imposed on a \"per count\" basis.  See United States v. McGuire, 909 F.2d 440, 441-42 (11th Cir.1990);  United States v. Smith, 857 F.2d 682, 686 (10th Cir.1988);  United States v. Dobbins, 807 F.2d 130, 132 (8th Cir.1986) (per curiam);  United States v. Donaldson, 797 F.2d 125, 126-29 (3d Cir.1986);  United States v. Pagan, 785 F.2d 378, 381 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1017, 107 S.Ct. 667, 93 L.Ed.2d 719 (1986).  We agree that this is the correct approach.  We hold, therefore, that the court below did not err in imposing an aggregate special assessment of $2,850, corresponding to the number of counts of conviction.  We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

A superseding indictment charged him with causing fifty-seven unlawful wire transfers.  At the change-of-plea hearing, the prosecutor stated that these fifty-seven transfers involved $29,201.  The presentence report used the same dollar amount.  Be that as it may, the figures specified in the fifty-seven counts, when added together, aggregate $31,180</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court levied the special assessment under a statute that reads in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>(a) the court shall assess on any person convicted of an offense against the United States--</p>\n        <p>(2) in the case of a felony--</p>\n        <p>(a) the amount of $50 if the defendant is an individual;  ...</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013(a) (1988).  In this case, the $2,850 special assessment represents the $50 sum mentioned in the law, multiplied by the fifty-seven counts of conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute of conviction provides in relevant part that:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised ... any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money ... by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire ... communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be [punished as provided by law]....</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C.

For our part, those features of the sentence do not portend multiplicity.  Absent clear language indicating a contrary intent, it is to be presumed that sentences imposed on more than one count at the same time are to run concurrently.  See, e.g., United States v. Schultz, 384 F.2d 374, 375 (5th Cir.1967)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Of course, beyond the all-important difference between section 1344's focus on execution of a scheme as opposed to section 1343's focus on the individual (covered) acts undertaken in executing the scheme, there are also factual distinctions between Lilly and this case.  Although appellant, like Lilly, devised one scheme to defraud one victim, he procured multiple sums of money through multiple wire transfers.  Lilly, however, engaged in one transaction with one bank, procuring one large sum of money in one loan--a set of facts critical to the analysis of the twenty-nine counts at issue there.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 304.   We take no view on the purely hypothetical question of how appellant's case might fare if he, like Lilly, had victimized a financial institution and had been charged with bank fraud rather than wire fraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant suggests that the rule of lenity pertains in this case because 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 does not specifically require that a defendant be punished for each act in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.  But a criminal statute must be ambiguous before the rule of lenity becomes relevant.  See Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980).  As the wire fraud statute is unambiguous, and the principle that each use of the wires constitutes a separate violation of section 1343 has been widely accepted for many years, see, e.g., United States v. Calvert, 523 F.2d 895, 903 n. 6 (8th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 1106, 47 L.Ed.2d 314 (1976);  Henderson v. United States, 425 F.2d 134, 138 n. 4 (5th Cir.1970), we have no occasion to engage the rule of lenity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Appellant's claim that his self-professed indigency affects the validity of the special assessment is not properly before us and we express no opinion on it.

Lilly dealt with bank fraud, not wire fraud.  This is no mere scrivener's discrepancy, for the Lilly court held that the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, could not be construed in pari passu with the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341, 1343.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 304 &amp; n. 8.   While the former statute criminalizes only the execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme to defraud a bank, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344 (rendering it unlawful for a person to \"knowingly execute[ ], or attempt[ ] to execute, a scheme or artifice ... to defraud a financial institution\"), the latter statutes criminalize specifically enumerated actions, e.g., interstate wire transmissions, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, so long as any such action is for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud.  This salient difference routs appellant's reliance on Lilly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Lilly is placed into proper perspective, appellant's multiplicity claim is easily dismantled.  \"It is well established that each use of the wires constitutes a separate crime under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, even if the several uses are in pursuance of but one criminal enterprise.\"  United States v. Fermin Castillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495010\"><a href=\"/opinion/495010/united-states-v-jose-cristobal-fermin-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1199 (1st Cir.1987).  Because each of the fifty-seven counts laid against appellant reflects a distinct wire transfer of funds, each count describes a separate violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343--even if the transfers collectively comprised a single execution of a single scheme.  See id.;  United States v. Benmuhar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393808\"><a href=\"/opinion/393808/united-states-v-moises-benmuhar-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></span> (1982).  On this point, Lilly does not prop up appellant's argument, but batters it, for Lilly expressly reaffirms the Fermin Castillo principle.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 303 n. 7 (\"Courts have routinely construed the mail and wire fraud statutes to criminalize each mailing or use of the wires.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that Lilly, properly read, is more bludgeon than crutch so far as appellant is concerned.  It follows that appellant's multiplicity claim is meritless.  The counts of conviction need not be merged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Construing the Special Assessment Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question we must confront is whether 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013, quoted supra note 2, required the district court to impose the monetary equivalent of fifty-seven special assessments in this case.  We think that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  When \"resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then to its legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\"  Blum v. Stenson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 896, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1541</span></a></span>, 1548, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span> (1984).  The statute at issue here provides that a district court \"shall\" impose the special assessment \"on any person convicted of an offense.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013(a) (emphasis supplied);  see also id. at Sec. 3013(a)(2) (providing for the assessment \"in the case of a felony \") (emphasis supplied).  This language admits of only one plausible construction:  that a $50 special assessment must be imposed on a defendant who stands convicted of a federal offense that is a felony.  And because the statute is phrased in the singular, its terms imply that each offense--each felony--calls for a separate special assessment, even when a single defendant is simultaneously convicted of multiple charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history suggests the same interpretation.  The statute was enacted as part of the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act.  The Senate Report which accompanied section 3013 states that \"[t]he purpose of imposing nominal assessment fees is to generate needed income\" to stock a victims' assistance fund, simultaneously created.  S.Rep. No. 497, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3607, 3619.  Because the aim of section 3013 is to generate revenue, and because construing it according to the tenor of its text will maximize that goal, we are hard pressed to see how the statute can bear a contrary reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not pioneers in reaching the conclusion that, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013, a defendant convicted of multiple felonies is subject to multiple assessments.  Every court of appeals thus far to consider the question has ruled that the special assessment required by section 3013 must be imposed on a \"per count\" basis.  See United States v. McGuire, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545297\"><a href=\"/opinion/545297/united-states-v-kevin-m-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 441-42 (11th Cir.1990);  United States v.

We hold, therefore, that the court below did not err in imposing an aggregate special assessment of $2,850, corresponding to the number of counts of conviction.  We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

A superseding indictment charged him with causing fifty-seven unlawful wire transfers.  At the change-of-plea hearing, the prosecutor stated that these fifty-seven transfers involved $29,201.  The presentence report used the same dollar amount.  Be that as it may, the figures specified in the fifty-seven counts, when added together, aggregate $31,180</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court levied the special assessment under a statute that reads in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>(a) the court shall assess on any person convicted of an offense against the United States--</p>\n        <p>(2) in the case of a felony--</p>\n        <p>(a) the amount of $50 if the defendant is an individual;  ...</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. Sec. 3013(a) (1988).

For our part, those features of the sentence do not portend multiplicity.  Absent clear language indicating a contrary intent, it is to be presumed that sentences imposed on more than one count at the same time are to run concurrently.  See, e.g., United States v. Schultz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"277498\"><a href=\"/opinion/277498/francis-jarad-schultz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 375 (5th Cir.1967)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Of course, beyond the all-important difference between section 1344's focus on execution of a scheme as opposed to section 1343's focus on the individual (covered) acts undertaken in executing the scheme, there are also factual distinctions between Lilly and this case.  Although appellant, like Lilly, devised one scheme to defraud one victim, he procured multiple sums of money through multiple wire transfers.  Lilly, however, engaged in one transaction with one bank, procuring one large sum of money in one loan--a set of facts critical to the analysis of the twenty-nine counts at issue there.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 304.   We take no view on the purely hypothetical question of how appellant's case might fare if he, like Lilly, had victimized a financial institution and had been charged with bank fraud rather than wire fraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant suggests that the rule of lenity pertains in this case because 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 does not specifically require that a defendant be punished for each act in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.  But a criminal statute must be ambiguous before the rule of lenity becomes relevant.  See Bifulco v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 387, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
