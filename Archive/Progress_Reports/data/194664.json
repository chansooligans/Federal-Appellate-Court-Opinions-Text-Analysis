This is a diversity trip-and-\n                                 \n\nfall case  in which a youth  was injured in a  Woolworth store in\n\nSan  Juan, Puerto Rico.   The youth, Wally  Cora, and his mother,\n\nGladys  Alvira, are  co-plaintiffs.   F.W.  Woolworth Company  is\n\ndefendant.   A jury trial  before a Magistrate  Judge resulted in\n\nverdicts awarding  Wally $40,000 (minus 25%  for his contributory\n\nnegligence) and Gladys Alvira $20,000 for her mental anguish.\n\n     Woolworth  appeals the  court's  denial of  its motions  for\n\ndirected  verdict  and   judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict,\n\nalleging insufficient evidence of liability;  in the alternative,\n\nit seeks a  new trial  on mental anguish  damages, alleging  that\n\nthey  are grossly  excessive.   It  also  challenges the  court's\n\ntaxing of certain costs.\n\n     We affirm the judgments as  to liability and costs.  On  the\n\nissue  of damages  awarded to  Gladys Alvira, we  have determined\n\nthat,  on  this  record, any  award  in  excess  of $5,000  would\n\nconstitute  an abuse  of discretion  and therefore  condition the\n\ngrant of a new trial on rejection of a remittitur.\n\n                         I.  Sufficiency\n\n     Our  standard of review for  sufficiency is clear.   We view\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\n\nas well as giving  it the benefit of every  legitimate inference.\n\nWe reverse  a denial  of a motion  for directed  verdict only  if\n\nthere  appears but  one  reasonable conclusion,  in  this case  a\n\nconclusion  of  nonliability.    We  reject reliance  on  a  mere\n\nscintilla or speculation.  Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v.  Grove\n                                                                 \n\nMfg. Co., 958 F.2d 1169, 1171 (1st Cir. 1992).\n        \n\n     These are  the  facts,  so  viewed, which  are  relevant  to\n\nliability.   On  the  Saturday after  Thanksgiving, November  26,\n\n1988,  Wally Cora,  age 14,  visited a  Woolworth store  with two\n\nyoung friends, to  purchase a  cassette.  There  were many  other\n\nshoppers  crowding  the aisle  where Wally  and his  friends were\n\nwalking.   Wally followed  one of his  friends.  At  one point he\n\nbumped  into one  person,  then in  trying  to extricate  himself\n\nbumped into another, then moved to his left toward a  counter.  A\n\ncustomer at the  counter had  just then moved  away, revealing  a\n\nbroom leaning  against it.   Wally saw it  too late and  his feet\n\nbecame entangled with it, causing him to fall.\n\n     His left arm  was bent  and indeed had  suffered a  compound\n\nfracture, a  bone having punctured  the skin.   Blood was on  the\n\nfloor.  At this point a store employee took the broom  and put it\n\nin a  closet.  Another  customer who happened  to be  a paramedic\n\nattended Wally, who  was taken  to the office  where a  cardboard\n\nsplint immobilized his arm.  The store manager appeared,  yelling\n\nat Wally that he had been running and that he had a  videotape to\n\nprove it.  No such video  was ever shown and the manager  did not\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n     Appellant Woolworth  first argues  that plaintiff  failed to\n\nprove a dangerous condition as cause of his fall, citing Cotto v.\n                                                              \n\nConsolidated Mutual Ins. Co.,  116 D.P.R. 644 (1985).   This case\n                            \n\ninvolved a  shopper falling on  a slippery floor.   We have  read\n\n                               -3-\n\nCotto as  requiring a plaintiff, in a  case involving preexisting\n     \n\nconditions  of  the  premises,  to show  actual  or  constructive\n\nknowledge on  the  part of  the  defendant in  order to  make  an\n\naffirmative showing of negligence.  Mas v. United States, No. 92-\n                                                        \n\n1392, slip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 1993).\n\n     Appellant misconceives the nature  of this case.  The  cause\n\nof the  fall was  not a  condition that might  have been  brought\n\nabout  innocently  or  by  a  third  party,  where  a  landlord's\n\nnegligence  consists in  knowing  about the  condition and  doing\n\nnothing to remedy it.  Rather, the cause was the negligent act of\n\nan employee, in  the course  of her  work, in  placing the  broom\n\nwhere, in a crowded store, a passerby might not see it in time to\n\navoid tripping over  it.  Moreover, appellant posits its position\n\non  two facts that  we cannot accept: that  the broom was \"easily\n\nperceptible\" (brief, p. 11) and that plaintiff was running at the\n\ntime  (brief, p. 12).   Taking facts favorable  to plaintiffs, we\n\nmust assume that the broom  was not visible to Wally and  that he\n\nwas walking, not running.\n\n     In  sum,  this  was, as  tried,  a  case  that was  properly\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n                           II.  Damages\n\n      Our review of the  amount awarded to Gladys Alvira  for her\n\nmental  damages is stringently  restrained.   We may  not intrude\n\nunless  we  find  the  verdict grossly  disproportionate  to  the\n\ninjury.   Moreover, as  we said in  Wagenmann v.  Adams, 829 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n196,  215 (1st Cir. 1987), \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money\n\n                               -4-\n\ndamages  -- especially  in  cases which  involve few  significant\n\nitems  of measurable  economic  loss --  is  a matter  peculiarly\n\nwithin a jury's ken.\"  We elaborated in  Milone v. Moceri Family,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1988): \n    \n\n     The jury,  as we see it, is free to run the whole gamut\n     of euphonious notes -- to harmonize the verdict at  the\n     highest  or lowest  points for  which there is  a sound\n     evidentiary  predicate,  or anywhere  in between  -- so\n     long as the end result does  not violate the conscience\n     of  the court  or  strike such  a dissonant  chord that\n     justice would be denied  were the judgment permitted to\n\n     stand.\n\n     Our  analysis  begins by  noting  the  unusual circumstances\n\nunder which the  issue of mental anguish  damages was tried.   No\n\nexperts testified  for plaintiffs; reliance was  placed wholly on\n\nthe medical reports.   Plaintiff Gladys  Alvira did not  testify.\n\nInstead, the parties agreed to the following stipulation:\n\n     We stipulate  that plaintiff has not put to testify co-\n     plaintiff, Gladys  Alvira.   And we stipulate  that her\n     testimony was about her suffering of  the mother.  What\n     she saw and felt  and looked at her boy  suffering from\n     the injury.\n\n     Accordingly, the evidence relating to the possible suffering\n\nof mental anguish by Wally's mother must rest on the testimony of\n\nWally, of defendant's medical expert, and on the medical records.\n\nFirst  of all,  we  summarize the  history of  medical attention,\n\npicking up the story where we left off.\n\n     From the manager's office at the store, Wally was taken to a\n\nmunicipal  diagnostic  center  or  dispensary where  X-rays  were\n\ntaken.   From there he was admitted  to the emergency room of the\n\nPuerto  Rico Medical Center at 9:45 p.m., almost five hours after\n\n                               -5-\n\nhis fall.    He was  accompanied  by a  friend  and the  friend's\n\nmother.   Wally's own  mother at this  point did not  know of the\n\naccident.    Two  days later,  on  November  28,  Wally had  been\n\nadmitted  to the San Juan City Hospital.   A record noted that he\n\nhad no relatives,  that a neighbor referred to him  as an orphan,\n\nand that he had been living  with a \"tutor\" who had disappeared a\n\nfew days previously.   In the absence of  parental authorization,\n\nit  was determined, because the fracture (described as \"left open\n\ndistal third forearm fracture\")  was compound, to perform surgery\n\non an emergency basis.\n\n     Surgery  under  general anaesthesia  proceeded successfully,\n\naligning the bones and preventing infection.  His  discharge from\n\nthe  hospital  was delayed,  pending  efforts  by the  hospital's\n\nsocial  service department to arrange for placement of Wally.  He\n\nwas  discharged on  December  5.   Shortly  thereafter, in  early\n\nJanuary of 1989,  Wally went to New York to  his brother Rafael's\n\nhome.   On January 17, accompanied  by Rafael, Wally had his cast\n\nremoved at  Lincoln Hospital.   We have no  information regarding\n\nthe  whereabouts or condition of  Gladys Alvira until  a year and\n\nthree  or four  months  later when,  in  April of  1990,  Rafael,\n\nGladys, and Wally returned to live in Puerto Rico.\n\n     Wally's  testimony as to his  present condition was that his\n\narm still hurt when he  did any heavy lifting, that he  felt pain\n\nin his wrist and elbow during  a change in weather, that he could\n\nnot play baseball, and that  he did not play on basketball  teams\n\nout  of apprehension  of  having his  arm  struck.   Doctors  who\n\n                               -6-\n\nexamined  him,  one at  his  request, the  other  at defendant's,\n\nagreed that there was  no neurological damage, that the  left arm\n\nfrom hand  to shoulder was  \"essentially normal,\" that  there was\n\ncomplete  range  of  motion,  good  alignment,  and  no  residual\n\nimpairment.  A small scar on the forearm remained.\n\n     This  is   the  record   on  which   we   must  assess   the\n\nreasonableness of an award of $20,000 to Wally's mother.  Up to a\n\npoint  we think that Woolworth  cannot complain.   Perhaps it had\n\nreasons to avoid  the risk  of stimulating a  jury's sympathy  by\n\nhaving Gladys Alvira testify.  It may have thought that a minimal\n\nand  bland  stipulation  was  less likely  to  eventuate  into  a\n\nsizeable verdict than more detailed testimony.\n\n     On  the  other hand,  we have  evidence  in the  record that\n\narouses our skepticism that a jury reasonably  could have awarded\n\nthe  mother one  half  of the  amount  awarded (subject  to  a 25\n\npercent discount) to the son.   The mother was not present during\n\nthe period of agony  and operation; indeed, she was  in ignorance\n\nof the accident.  As  far as the record reveals, she was not with\n\nher  son during  his convalescence.   Indeed, the  medical record\n\nnotes suggest that there was no close relationship between mother\n\nand son  prior to the accident.   The jury had  no opportunity to\n\nview the mother and  hear her describe such suffering as  she may\n\nhave  endured.   Nor do  we  have any  reason proffered,  such as\n\nillness,  to  explain why  the jury  was  to be  deprived  of the\n\nopportunity to assess her credibility.\n\n                               -7-\n\n     Appellee reminds us of De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion  Insular\n                                                                 \n\nde Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 125-26 (1st Cir. 1991), where we upheld\n          \n\nthe  action of the district court in reducing an $800,000 verdict\n\nfor emotional damages by  ordering a remittitur to $110,000.   In\n\nthat case  plaintiff's daughter-in-law had given  birth to twins.\n\nOne of them inadvertently  was switched with a twin  from another\n\npair and brought up as a natural child of the plaintiff's son and\n\ndaughter-in-law,  and as his  own granddaughter.   The mix-up was\n\ndiscovered  nearly two  years later.   Plaintiff's  distress over\n\nlosing the grandchild he  thought his own and over  the wrenching\n\nexperience  of  his  son  and daughter-in-law  was  described  in\n\ntestimony by all three. \n\n     The  district  court   carefully  evaluated  the   evidence,\n\nobserving  that the plaintiff had not lived in Puerto Rico during\n\nthe period of nondiscovery and had visited the twins no more than\n\ntwice a month, still had the opportunity to maintain contact with\n\nhis  quondam  granddaughter,  and  had produced  no  evidence  of\n\neconomic  loss or  expert testimony  as to  psychological damage.\n\nThe court, in settling upon the figure of $110,000, left no doubt\n\nthat  it was  sounding the  highest \"euphonious  note\" consistent\n\nwith  the  evidence.   de Leon  Lopez  v. Corporacion  Insular de\n                                                                 \n\nSeguros, 742 F. Supp. 44, 47 n.7 (D.P.R. 1990).\n       \n\n     Appellee argues that our affirmance of the $110,00 figure in\n\na  case with such minimal evidence of psychic harm amply supports\n\naffirming the $20,000 figure in this case.  We disagree.   In the\n\nfirst place, Lopez involved \"appellate review of  post-remittitur\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n\ndamages for non-economic losses[, which] is extremely narrow. . .\n\n.\"  931 F.2d at 125.  We indeed are loath \"to grade the teacher's\n\ngrading of the essay.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 215.  In this case\n                                 \n\nthe  Magistrate Judge  did  not reveal  to  us any  such  grading\n\nprocess; indeed, there was precious little essay to grade.\n\n     In the second place, in this case, unlike in Lopez, 931 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  126, we  cannot  say that  \"the  jury system,  which  depends\n\nheavily  on the common  sense and collective  human experience of\n\njurors  for a  fair resolution  of such  quandaries [involved  in\n\ntranslating distress into dollars], has rendered yeoman service.\"\n\nThrough no fault of  its own, the jury lacked the  ordinary basis\n\nfor applying its common sense; it had no testimony from or  about\n\nthe  sufferer.   The slate  was not  quite blank.    What factual\n\nindications  there were indicated  that in  the short  run Gladys\n\nAlvira did not know of Wally's accident and suffering and that in\n\nthe  long run  the  residual effects  of  the accident  were  not\n\nsevere. \n\n     In  sum, even  crediting Gladys  Alvira, as  the stipulation\n\ncommands, with  the normal  concern  and suffering  over a  son's\n\naccident  and resulting aches and  pains, we feel  that $5,000 is\n\nthe limit of an adequate award for mental anguish in this case.\n\n                           III.  Costs\n\n     Appellant  challenges   the  allowance   of  the   costs  of\n\ntranscribing  depositions  of  appellant's  expert  witness  (who\n\ntestified) and of appellant's  store manager (who did not).   The\n\nbasis of  the challenge  was simply that  neither deposition  was\n\n                               -9-\n\nintroduced  at trial.   But  it is  obvious that  plaintiffs were\n\nprudent  in  deposing  appellant's  expert and  in  reducing  his\n\ncomments to writing, whether or not any specific part was used in\n\ncross examination.   And  it was  essential that plaintiffs  know\n\nwhat the store  manager was  prepared to say;  it was  apparently\n\nthis deposition that informed the plaintiffs that no videotape of\n\nWally's running existed.  \n\n     As we said in Templeman v.  Chris Craft Corp., 770 F.2d 245,\n                                                  \n\n249  (1st Cir.  1985),  \"[i]t is  within  the discretion  of  the\n\ndistrict court  to tax deposition costs  if special circumstances\n\nwarrant  it, even though the depositions were not put in evidence\n\nor  used  at  trial.\"    As  for  appellant's   contentions  that\n\nplaintiffs'  expert witness's  fee  for attendance  at the  trial\n\nshould be denied because he was not a treating physician and that\n\nthe cost of copying papers should be excluded, we see no merit in\n\nthem.\n\n     The judgments  of  liability and  the  taxing of  costs  are\n\naffirmed.  The  denial of the motion for new  trial as to damages\n\nfor  the mental anguish of  Gladys Alvira is  reversed unless the\n\nplaintiffs agree to accept a remittitur of $5,000.  No costs.\n\n                               -10-\n",

This is a diversity trip-and-\n                                 \n\nfall case  in which a youth  was injured in a  Woolworth store in\n\nSan  Juan, Puerto Rico.   The youth, Wally  Cora, and his mother,\n\nGladys  Alvira, are  co-plaintiffs.   F.W.  Woolworth Company  is\n\ndefendant.   A jury trial  before a Magistrate  Judge resulted in\n\nverdicts awarding  Wally $40,000 (minus 25%  for his contributory\n\nnegligence) and Gladys Alvira $20,000 for her mental anguish.\n\n     Woolworth  appeals the  court's  denial of  its motions  for\n\ndirected  verdict  and   judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict,\n\nalleging insufficient evidence of liability;  in the alternative,\n\nit seeks a  new trial  on mental anguish  damages, alleging  that\n\nthey  are grossly  excessive.   It  also  challenges the  court's\n\ntaxing of certain costs.\n\n     We affirm the judgments as  to liability and costs.  On  the\n\nissue  of damages  awarded to  Gladys Alvira, we  have determined\n\nthat,  on  this  record, any  award  in  excess  of $5,000  would\n\nconstitute  an abuse  of discretion  and therefore  condition the\n\ngrant of a new trial on rejection of a remittitur.\n\n                         I.  Sufficiency\n\n     Our  standard of review for  sufficiency is clear.   We view\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\n\nas well as giving  it the benefit of every  legitimate inference.\n\nWe reverse  a denial  of a motion  for directed  verdict only  if\n\nthere  appears but  one  reasonable conclusion,  in  this case  a\n\nconclusion  of  nonliability.    We  reject reliance  on  a  mere\n\nscintilla or speculation.  Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v.  Grove\n                                                                 \n\nMfg.

On  the  Saturday after  Thanksgiving, November  26,\n\n1988,  Wally Cora,  age 14,  visited a  Woolworth store  with two\n\nyoung friends, to  purchase a  cassette.  There  were many  other\n\nshoppers  crowding  the aisle  where Wally  and his  friends were\n\nwalking.   Wally followed  one of his  friends.  At  one point he\n\nbumped  into one  person,  then in  trying  to extricate  himself\n\nbumped into another, then moved to his left toward a  counter.  A\n\ncustomer at the  counter had  just then moved  away, revealing  a\n\nbroom leaning  against it.   Wally saw it  too late and  his feet\n\nbecame entangled with it, causing him to fall.\n\n     His left arm  was bent  and indeed had  suffered a  compound\n\nfracture, a  bone having punctured  the skin.   Blood was on  the\n\nfloor.  At this point a store employee took the broom  and put it\n\nin a  closet.  Another  customer who happened  to be  a paramedic\n\nattended Wally, who  was taken  to the office  where a  cardboard\n\nsplint immobilized his arm.  The store manager appeared,  yelling\n\nat Wally that he had been running and that he had a  videotape to\n\nprove it.  No such video  was ever shown and the manager  did not\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n     Appellant Woolworth  first argues  that plaintiff  failed to\n\nprove a dangerous condition as cause of his fall, citing Cotto v.\n                                                              \n\nConsolidated Mutual Ins. Co.,  116 D.P.R. 644 (1985).   This case\n                            \n\ninvolved a  shopper falling on  a slippery floor.   We have  read\n\n                               -3-\n\nCotto as  requiring a plaintiff, in a  case involving preexisting\n     \n\nconditions  of  the  premises,  to show  actual  or  constructive\n\nknowledge on  the  part of  the  defendant in  order to  make  an\n\naffirmative showing of negligence.  Mas v. United States, No. 92-\n                                                        \n\n1392, slip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 1993).\n\n     Appellant misconceives the nature  of this case.  The  cause\n\nof the  fall was  not a  condition that might  have been  brought\n\nabout  innocently  or  by  a  third  party,  where  a  landlord's\n\nnegligence  consists in  knowing  about the  condition and  doing\n\nnothing to remedy it.  Rather, the cause was the negligent act of\n\nan employee, in  the course  of her  work, in  placing the  broom\n\nwhere, in a crowded store, a passerby might not see it in time to\n\navoid tripping over  it.  Moreover, appellant posits its position\n\non  two facts that  we cannot accept: that  the broom was \"easily\n\nperceptible\" (brief, p. 11) and that plaintiff was running at the\n\ntime  (brief, p. 12).   Taking facts favorable  to plaintiffs, we\n\nmust assume that the broom  was not visible to Wally and  that he\n\nwas walking, not running.\n\n     In  sum,  this  was, as  tried,  a  case  that was  properly\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n                           II.  Damages\n\n      Our review of the  amount awarded to Gladys Alvira  for her\n\nmental  damages is stringently  restrained.   We may  not intrude\n\nunless  we  find  the  verdict grossly  disproportionate  to  the\n\ninjury.   Moreover, as  we said in  Wagenmann v.  Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  215 (1st Cir. 1987), \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money\n\n                               -4-\n\ndamages  -- especially  in  cases which  involve few  significant\n\nitems  of measurable  economic  loss --  is  a matter  peculiarly\n\nwithin a jury's ken.\"  We elaborated in  Milone v. Moceri Family,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506191\"><a href=\"/opinion/506191/vincent-milone-v-moceri-family-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (1st Cir. 1988): \n    \n\n     The jury,  as we see it, is free to run the whole gamut\n     of euphonious notes -- to harmonize the verdict at  the\n     highest  or lowest  points for  which there is  a sound\n     evidentiary  predicate,  or anywhere  in between  -- so\n     long as the end result does  not violate the conscience\n     of  the court  or  strike such  a dissonant  chord that\n     justice would be denied  were the judgment permitted to\n\n     stand.\n\n     Our  analysis  begins by  noting  the  unusual circumstances\n\nunder which the  issue of mental anguish  damages was tried.   No\n\nexperts testified  for plaintiffs; reliance was  placed wholly on\n\nthe medical reports.   Plaintiff Gladys  Alvira did not  testify.\n\nInstead, the parties agreed to the following stipulation:\n\n     We stipulate  that plaintiff has not put to testify co-\n     plaintiff, Gladys  Alvira.   And we stipulate  that her\n     testimony was about her suffering of  the mother.  What\n     she saw and felt  and looked at her boy  suffering from\n     the injury.\n\n     Accordingly, the evidence relating to the possible suffering\n\nof mental anguish by Wally's mother must rest on the testimony of\n\nWally, of defendant's medical expert, and on the medical records.\n\nFirst  of all,  we  summarize the  history of  medical attention,\n\npicking up the story where we left off.\n\n     From the manager's office at the store, Wally was taken to a\n\nmunicipal  diagnostic  center  or  dispensary where  X-rays  were\n\ntaken.   From there he was admitted  to the emergency room of the\n\nPuerto  Rico Medical Center at 9:45 p.m., almost five hours after\n\n                               -5-\n\nhis fall.    He was  accompanied  by a  friend  and the  friend's\n\nmother.   Wally's own  mother at this  point did not  know of the\n\naccident.    Two  days later,  on  November  28,  Wally had  been\n\nadmitted  to the San Juan City Hospital.   A record noted that he\n\nhad no relatives,  that a neighbor referred to him  as an orphan,\n\nand that he had been living  with a \"tutor\" who had disappeared a\n\nfew days previously.   In the absence of  parental authorization,\n\nit  was determined, because the fracture (described as \"left open\n\ndistal third forearm fracture\")  was compound, to perform surgery\n\non an emergency basis.\n\n     Surgery  under  general anaesthesia  proceeded successfully,\n\naligning the bones and preventing infection.  His  discharge from\n\nthe  hospital  was delayed,  pending  efforts  by the  hospital's\n\nsocial  service department to arrange for placement of Wally.  He\n\nwas  discharged on  December  5.   Shortly  thereafter, in  early\n\nJanuary of 1989,  Wally went to New York to  his brother Rafael's\n\nhome.   On January 17, accompanied  by Rafael, Wally had his cast\n\nremoved at  Lincoln Hospital.   We have no  information regarding\n\nthe  whereabouts or condition of  Gladys Alvira until  a year and\n\nthree  or four  months  later when,  in  April of  1990,  Rafael,\n\nGladys, and Wally returned to live in Puerto Rico.\n\n     Wally's  testimony as to his  present condition was that his\n\narm still hurt when he  did any heavy lifting, that he  felt pain\n\nin his wrist and elbow during  a change in weather, that he could\n\nnot play baseball, and that  he did not play on basketball  teams\n\nout  of apprehension  of  having his  arm  struck.   Doctors  who\n\n                               -6-\n\nexamined  him,  one at  his  request, the  other  at defendant's,\n\nagreed that there was  no neurological damage, that the  left arm\n\nfrom hand  to shoulder was  \"essentially normal,\" that  there was\n\ncomplete  range  of  motion,  good  alignment,  and  no  residual\n\nimpairment.  A small scar on the forearm remained.\n\n     This  is   the  record   on  which   we   must  assess   the\n\nreasonableness of an award of $20,000 to Wally's mother.  Up to a\n\npoint  we think that Woolworth  cannot complain.   Perhaps it had\n\nreasons to avoid  the risk  of stimulating a  jury's sympathy  by\n\nhaving Gladys Alvira testify.  It may have thought that a minimal\n\nand  bland  stipulation  was  less likely  to  eventuate  into  a\n\nsizeable verdict than more detailed testimony.\n\n     On  the  other hand,  we have  evidence  in the  record that\n\narouses our skepticism that a jury reasonably  could have awarded\n\nthe  mother one  half  of the  amount  awarded (subject  to  a 25\n\npercent discount) to the son.   The mother was not present during\n\nthe period of agony  and operation; indeed, she was  in ignorance\n\nof the accident.  As  far as the record reveals, she was not with\n\nher  son during  his convalescence.   Indeed, the  medical record\n\nnotes suggest that there was no close relationship between mother\n\nand son  prior to the accident.   The jury had  no opportunity to\n\nview the mother and  hear her describe such suffering as  she may\n\nhave  endured.   Nor do  we  have any  reason proffered,  such as\n\nillness,  to  explain why  the jury  was  to be  deprived  of the\n\nopportunity to assess her credibility.\n\n                               -7-\n\n     Appellee reminds us of De Leon Lopez v.

In\n\nthat case  plaintiff's daughter-in-law had given  birth to twins.\n\nOne of them inadvertently  was switched with a twin  from another\n\npair and brought up as a natural child of the plaintiff's son and\n\ndaughter-in-law,  and as his  own granddaughter.   The mix-up was\n\ndiscovered  nearly two  years later.   Plaintiff's  distress over\n\nlosing the grandchild he  thought his own and over  the wrenching\n\nexperience  of  his  son  and daughter-in-law  was  described  in\n\ntestimony by all three. \n\n     The  district  court   carefully  evaluated  the   evidence,\n\nobserving  that the plaintiff had not lived in Puerto Rico during\n\nthe period of nondiscovery and had visited the twins no more than\n\ntwice a month, still had the opportunity to maintain contact with\n\nhis  quondam  granddaughter,  and  had produced  no  evidence  of\n\neconomic  loss or  expert testimony  as to  psychological damage.\n\nThe court, in settling upon the figure of $110,000, left no doubt\n\nthat  it was  sounding the  highest \"euphonious  note\" consistent\n\nwith  the  evidence.   de Leon  Lopez  v.

We disagree.   In the\n\nfirst place, Lopez involved \"appellate review of  post-remittitur\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n\ndamages for non-economic losses[, which] is extremely narrow. . .\n\n.\"  931 F.2d at 125.

In this case\n                                 \n\nthe  Magistrate Judge  did  not reveal  to  us any  such  grading\n\nprocess; indeed, there was precious little essay to grade.\n\n     In the second place, in this case, unlike in Lopez, 931 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  126, we  cannot  say that  \"the  jury system,  which  depends\n\nheavily  on the common  sense and collective  human experience of\n\njurors  for a  fair resolution  of such  quandaries [involved  in\n\ntranslating distress into dollars], has rendered yeoman service.\"\n\nThrough no fault of  its own, the jury lacked the  ordinary basis\n\nfor applying its common sense; it had no testimony from or  about\n\nthe  sufferer.   The slate  was not  quite blank.    What factual\n\nindications  there were indicated  that in  the short  run Gladys\n\nAlvira did not know of Wally's accident and suffering and that in\n\nthe  long run  the  residual effects  of  the accident  were  not\n\nsevere. \n\n     In  sum, even  crediting Gladys  Alvira, as  the stipulation\n\ncommands, with  the normal  concern  and suffering  over a  son's\n\naccident  and resulting aches and  pains, we feel  that $5,000 is\n\nthe limit of an adequate award for mental anguish in this case.\n\n                           III.  Costs\n\n     Appellant  challenges   the  allowance   of  the   costs  of\n\ntranscribing  depositions  of  appellant's  expert  witness  (who\n\ntestified) and of appellant's  store manager (who did not).   The\n\nbasis of  the challenge  was simply that  neither deposition  was\n\n                               -9-\n\nintroduced  at trial.   But  it is  obvious that  plaintiffs were\n\nprudent  in  deposing  appellant's  expert and  in  reducing  his\n\ncomments to writing, whether or not any specific part was used in\n\ncross examination.   And  it was  essential that plaintiffs  know\n\nwhat the store  manager was  prepared to say;  it was  apparently\n\nthis deposition that informed the plaintiffs that no videotape of\n\nWally's running existed.  \n\n     As we said in Templeman v.
