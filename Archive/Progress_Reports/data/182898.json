D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William S. Maddox on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief and Thomas E. Delahanty\nII, United States Attorney, on motion for summary affirmance for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 18, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam.   This is Raymond Davis's direct appeal from\n\nhis 84-month sentence, which included a downward departure for\n\nsubstantial assistance below the otherwise applicable 120-month\n\nmandatory minimum.   The government has moved to dismiss the appeal\n\nas barred by an appeal waiver in Davis's plea agreement, under\n\nwhich Davis agreed to waive his right to appeal as long as his\n\nsentence was not longer than 120 months. For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow, we agree that the appeal waiver precludes this appeal and\n\ntherefore grant the government's motion and summarily dismiss the\n\nappeal.\n\n          Ordinarily,    the    standards   for    assessing    the\n\nenforceability of an appeal waiver are those set forth in United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001).1   Under those\n\nstandards, presentence waivers of appeal are enforceable if the\n\nwaiver was \"knowing\" and \"voluntary\" and if enforcing it would not\n\nresult in a \"miscarriage of justice.\"   Id. at 24-25.\n\n\n     1\n      We have held that where, as here, a defendant did not object\nin the district court to the sufficiency of that court's\nexplanation of an appeal waiver, appellate review of that issue is\nunder the demanding plain-error standard.     Borrero-Acevedo, 533\nF.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 587 (2008).\nHowever, where, as is also true here, the government does not\ninvoke that standard in its discussion of the appeal waiver, we\nhave continued to apply the Teeter standards without the plain-\nerror overlay. See United States v. Edelen, 539 F.3d 83, 85 n.1\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 427 (2008); United States v.\nChandler, 534 F.3d 45, 49 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008). We therefore apply\nthe Teeter standards here. But, because we see no error, plain or\notherwise, in the district court's explanation of the appeal\nwaiver, the standard of review is immaterial to our disposition of\nthis case.\n\n                                -2-\n\f            Davis's sole argument against enforcing the appeal waiver\n\nis that the waiver was unknowing because he did not understand what\n\nfactors the court would apply in determining the extent of any\n\ndownward departure for substantial assistance.2      In adjudicating\n\nsuch a claim, we evaluate whether the written plea agreement\n\n\"contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating\n\nits scope\" and whether the district court \"inquire[d] specifically\n\nat the change-of-plea hearing into any waiver of appellate rights.\"\n\nId. at 24; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N) (requiring such an\n\ninquiry).\n\n            Davis makes no argument that the written appeal waiver\n\nwas unclear.    Nor does he find fault with the district court's\n\nexplanation of that waiver at the change-of-plea hearing.     Rather,\n\nhis argument focuses exclusively on Davis's purported lack of\n\nunderstanding that the court would not apply the factors contained\n\nin 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a) in determining the length of the downward\n\ndeparture for substantial assistance.\n\n            Any misunderstanding in that regard cannot be attributed\n\nto the district court's lack of explanation, either at the change-\n\nof-plea hearing or at sentencing.      At the change-of-plea hearing,\n\nthere was no occasion for the court to explain how it would\n\n\n\n     2\n      Although he alludes to the \"manifest injustice\" prong of the\nTeeter standard in his statement of the standard of review, he\nmakes no argument that enforcing the waiver in this case would be\nmanifestly unjust.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdetermine the extent of any downward departure for substantial\n\nassistance, since, at that point, the government had not moved for\n\nsuch a departure, and the parties' cooperation agreement expressly\n\nstated that the government was not required to do so.                  In the\n\nabsence of such a motion or any other basis for determining what\n\nDavis's sentence was likely to be, the court explained, in general\n\nterms, that it would calculate the guideline range but might depart\n\nor vary from that range and confirmed that Davis understood that\n\nexplanation.     Nothing more was required.          See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(M) (requiring the court \"to inform the defendant of, and\n\ndetermine    that   the   defendant    understands   .   .   .   the   court's\n\nobligation to calculate the applicable sentencing-guideline range\n\nand   to   consider   that   range,    possible   departures      under    the\n\nSentencing     Guidelines,    and     other   sentencing     factors      under\n\nยง 3553(a)\").\n\n            At sentencing, the court made perfectly clear that it\n\nwould not consider the section 3553(a) factors in determining the\n\nextent of the downward departure.3            It also clearly explained\n\nDavis's appeal waiver and ascertained that Davis understood it.\n\n\n      3\n      The court's conclusion that it could not do so was correct.\nSee United States v. Poland, 562 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir. 2009);\nUnited States v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2002).\nTherefore, any argument that justice requires overlooking the\nappeal waiver to reach Davis's argument to the contrary--the sole\nsubstantive argument made on appeal--would be unavailing.      See\nUnited States v. Nguyen, 618 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.) (holding that\nwhere there was no error, there was \"a fortiori, no miscarriage of\njustice\"), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 548 (2010).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          Davis has thus failed to show that the appeal waiver was\n\nunknowing and therefore unenforceable.   Accordingly, the appeal is\n\nsummarily dismissed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
