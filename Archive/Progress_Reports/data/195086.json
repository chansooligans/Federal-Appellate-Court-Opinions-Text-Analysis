Carol Fusco was injured in a car\n                          \n\naccident and brought  suit against General Motors,  the car's\n\nmanufacturer.  A jury awarded Fusco $1 million in damages and\n\nGeneral Motors has appealed, challenging rulings on  evidence\n\nand discovery made by the district judge.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     On December  15,  1986, Fusco  was  driving her  car,  a\n\nChevrolet  Chevette, near  Pelham, New  Hampshire.   Her  car\n\nsuddenly  left  the  roadway,  slid   across  an  ice-covered\n\nembankment,  and hit  a telephone  pole  somewhere along  the\n\nfront left side of the car.  Fusco was injured.\n\n     Fusco brought suit against General Motors in state court\n\nin  New  Hampshire, claiming  that  a  key component  in  the\n\nsteering system--the front left  \"ball stud\"--had broken from\n\nmetal  fatigue  and  caused the  disaster.1    General Motors\n\nremoved the  case  to federal  district  court and  took  the\n\nposition that  the ball stud  had not been  the cause  of the\n\naccident  but  rather  had fractured  when  the  car hit  the\n\ntelephone  pole.   A  jury  trial,  begun  on July  7,  1992,\n\nresulted in  an evenly  divided hung  jury, and  the district\n\ncourt promptly ordered a second trial for November 16, 1992.\n\n                    \n\n     1It appears that  the ball is a spherical  object with a\nprotruding stud; that the ball and stud together form part of\nthe  elaborate connection (via the tie rod and steering gear)\nbetween  the tire wheel or  axle and the  steering wheel.  If\nthe  stud  breaks  entirely,  the tire  wheel  is  no  longer\ncontrolled by the steering wheel.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     At the  second trial Fusco offered  eyewitness testimony\n\nthat her car had abruptly veered off the highway and collided\n\nwith a telephone pole.  A state trooper  who arrived first at\n\nthe accident testified  that the car was  resting against the\n\npole near the  hinge pillar on the driver's  side, a location\n\nbetween the  door and the  left front fender.   Fusco offered\n\ntwo  experts (Robert Walson  and Carl  Thelin) who,  based in\n\npart on  this testimony and  their examination of  the broken\n\nball stud, concluded that  metal fatigue had caused  the stud\n\nto break, causing the steering  apparatus to fail and the car\n\nto veer into the pole.\n\n     Walson,  a metallurgist,  testified that the  surface of\n\nthe   broken   ball   stud  taken   from   Fusco's   car  was\n\ncharacteristic of a fatigue, rather than an impact, fracture.\n\nHe  supported his  opinion  in  several  ways  including  his\n\npretrial examination of the surface  of the ball stud under a\n\nscanning electron microscope; he was fiercely  cross-examined\n\nby  General  Motors  about  this  examination.    Thelin,  an\n\nautomotive  engineer, testified  that General  Motors' design\n\nand quality control of the  ball stud were inadequate.  Based\n\non partial reconstruction of the accident, he also challenged\n\nGeneral Motors' argument that the telephone pole impact could\n\nhave broken the ball stud.\n\n     General Motors' case included testimony from  its expert\n\nJerry  Chiddister who reconstructed the accident based on his\n\n                             -3-\n\nexperience with many  crash tests.  In his  view, the car had\n\n\"sideslipped\" into  the telephone  pole, causing  the car  to\n\nslide along  the pole starting  at the front left  fender and\n\nending with the pole lying next to the door hinge column.  He\n\nopined that on  its travel down the side of the car, the pole\n\nhit the front left tire and the impact broke the ball stud, a\n\npredictable  occurrence given the estimated speed of the car.\n\nHad the  stud broken before  the car veered,  Chiddister said\n\nthat there would  have been a  heavy black tire  mark on  the\n\nroad  because the uncontrolled tire would have dragged as the\n\ncar slid off course.\n\n     Kirk  Ulman,  another General  Motors  expert, testified\n\nthat he had examined  the ball stud itself.  He explained why\n\nthe  location of the  break (at  the neck  of the  stud), the\n\nsurface  of the break (grainy  with chevron marks), and other\n\ncharacteristics meant  that impact  and not  fatigue was  the\n\ncause.   James Willis, who worked in General Motors' facility\n\nthat made the steering gear, testified to quality control and\n\nthe  nature of simulated  fatigue fractures.   Ray Schultz, a\n\nmetallurgist, confirmed Ulman's testimony on key points.\n\n     The  jury rendered  a  verdict  in  favor of  Fusco  and\n\nawarded  her $1  million  in damages.    General Motors  then\n\nappealed.  In its brief General Motors does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency  of  Fusco's  evidence  but  confines  itself  to\n\ncontesting several evidentiary and discovery rulings, rulings\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat can  only  be understood  against  the backdrop  of  the\n\ntestimony  already described.  Although these claims of error\n\nare not frivolous, we do not think that  any of them warrants\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                             II.\n\n     General  Motors' first  claim  on  appeal  is  that  the\n\ndistrict  court erred in  ruling, prior  to the  first trial,\n\nthat two videotapes--the  \"driving tapes\"--were inadmissible.\n\nThe main tape  made in  1992 has  two parts.   In the  indoor\n\npart, Ulman  used a  car mounted  on a  lift  to display  the\n\nfunction of the  ball stud and tie rod and showed how in this\n\ndemonstration  the connection between  the stud and  the tire\n\nwheel or axle had  been altered in the  test vehicle so  that\n\nthe stud could be released deliberately from inside the car.\n\n     In the  outdoor part,  filmed at  a General Motors  test\n\ntrack, Ulman drove the Chevette while Willis,  sitting in the\n\npassenger  seat, intentionally disconnected  the tie rod from\n\nthe tire  wheel.  The film  showed that, when  the left wheel\n\nfinally  separated from  the rod,  the  wheel flopped  out of\n\nalignment with  the right  wheel and  dragged on  the highway\n\napparently creating a  long black skid mark.  The car did not\n\nveer out of  control or  hit the  track barrier.   The  other\n\ntape, made  in  1986,  simply  showed a  similar  test  track\n\ndemonstration with a  different driver and passenger.   Thus,\n\n                             -5-\n\nthere is no need for  an independent discussion of this tape.\n\n     When General Motors produced the tapes to Fusco in  June\n\n1992, shortly before the first  trial, Fusco made a motion in\n                                                             \n\nlimine  to  exclude   them,  arguing  that  the   test  track\n      \n\nconditions did not  duplicate the conditions that  existed at\n\nthe time  of the actual accident.  In  an oral ruling on July\n\n8,  1992,  the  trial judge  granted  the  motion.   Although\n\nGeneral Motors argues  that the  exclusion of  the tapes  was\n\nerror, it  did not  seek to  offer the  tapes  at the  second\n\ntrial.\n\n     Seizing  on  this omission,  Fusco  argues that  General\n\nMotors has waived  its right to argue that  the exclusion was\n\nerror.   Fusco  points to  cases  holding that  an in  limine\n                                                             \n\nruling on evidence  may not be reviewed on  appeal unless the\n\noffer  or  objection  is renewed  when  evidence  is actually\n\npresented at trial.   This court has made general  statements\n\nto this  effect, e.g., United States v. Reed, 977 F.2d 14, 17\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992),  in cases  where  the in  limine motion  to\n                                                  \n\nexclude was denied and the opponent of the evidence failed to\n\nrenew the objection at trial. We  have found no case in  this\n\ncircuit, however,  where an in  limine motion to  exclude was\n                                      \n\ngranted  and the  proponent  of the  evidence, by  failing to\n\nrenew the offer at trial, was found to have waived the issue.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     Where an  objection to  evidence has  been overruled  in\n                                                             \n\nlimine,  it makes  sense  to require  that  the objection  be\n      \n\nrenewed at trial.  However  definite the denial of the motion\n\nto  exclude  prior to  trial,  it  is  child's play  for  the\n\nopponent  of the  evidence  to renew  the objection  when the\n\nevidence  is  actually  offered; and  requiring  this renewal\n\ngives the trial judge a  chance to reconsider the ruling with\n\nthe concrete  evidence presented in the actual context of the\n\ntrial.  The only criticism one might offer of the requirement\n\nis that  the Federal  Rules of Evidence  say nothing  about a\n\nsecond  objection,2 but any practiced trial lawyer knows that\n\nmuch of the law of evidence is not contained in these written\n\nrules.\n\n     On  the  other  hand,  where  the  motion  in limine  is\n                                                         \n\ngranted, and the  proponent of the evidence is  told that the\n\nevidence  will not be  admitted, the situation  is different.\n\nTo require that the evidence  be offered again at trial would\n\ncertainly give the trial court  a second chance, but doing so\n\ncan  hardly be  described  as  easy:   on  the contrary,  the\n\nproponent   would  have  to   engage  in  the   wasteful  and\n\ninconvenient  task  of  summoning   witnesses  or  organizing\n\n                    \n\n     2The Federal Rules of Evidence do  not address in limine\n                                                             \nmotions at all.   Instead the rules require  in general terms\nthat,  to  preserve a  ruling  on  evidence  for appeal,  the\nproponent  of evidence make its  substance known to the court\nand an opponent make known  the objection to the evidence and\nthe ground of the objection.  Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).\n\n                             -7-\n\ndemonstrative evidence  that the  proponent has  already been\n\ntold not to  offer.  Indeed, in many cases the prior grant of\n\nthe  in limine  motion would  make it  improper to  call such\n              \n\nwitnesses  without prior permission.  All the proponent could\n\ndo would be  to line up the  witnesses at trial and  then ask\n\npermission.\n\n     Although a  symmetrical rule  may be  preferable if  all\n\nelse is  equal, all else  is not equal  here.  Where  a court\n\nrules in limine  that certain  evidence is  excluded but  the\n               \n\nruling is merely  tentative or qualified, then  the proponent\n\nmight well have  to offer the evidence  at trial in order  to\n\npreserve an appeal on the issue.   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).  But\n\nwhere  the pretrial  proffer  is  adequate  and  evidence  is\n\nexcluded unconditionally by  a pretrial order, then  we think\n\nthat the  proponent has  preserved the  issue for appeal  and\n\n(other  circumstances  being unchanged)  need  not  bring the\n\nwitness  to court  and proffer  the evidence again  at trial.\n\nSee  McQuaig  v.  McCoy, 806  F.2d  1298,  1301-02 (5th  Cir.\n                       \n\n1987).3   The result  is the  same here  where the  in limine\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     3Preserving the  claim of  error based  on exclusion  of\nevidence requires  an adequate proffer, so that the trial and\nappellate courts  know what  evidence is at  issue.   Fed. R.\nEvid. 103(a).   There  may also  be cases  where a  change in\ncircum-stances,  after the in limine ruling but before trial,\n                                    \nmight make it  unreasonable for the proponent to  rely on the\nsolely in  limine ruling to  preserve the issue (a  new basis\n                 \nfor admissibility might  arise or the court's  initial reason\nfor exclusion might be mooted).\n\n                             -8-\n\norder preceded the  first trial because no one  disputes that\n\nthe same order governed the second trial.\n\n     Needless  to say, most district judges are very cautious\n\nabout making a definitive ruling in limine that evidence will\n                                          \n\nnot be received at trial.  Trial judges know better than most\n\nthat many issues  are best resolved in context  and only when\n\nfinally necessary.   But here, as happens from  time to time,\n\nthe trial judge did rule definitively that the evidence would\n\nnot be  admitted.  The  proffer was adequate since  the tapes\n\nwere apparently  available to  the court.   And no  change in\n\ncircumstances  occurred after the in limine ruling that might\n                                           \n\nhave  affected the controlling  ground for exclusion  or cast\n\nany  doubt on  the trial  judge's intention  to abide  by the\n\noriginal ruling.\n\n     Thus we turn  to the merits of the  ruling excluding the\n\ndriving tapes.  The oral ruling was terse (\"You don't have to\n\nargue it.   I'm not  going to let  it in.\") but  the district\n\njudge had a written motion from Fusco, and a written response\n\nfrom  General Motors, and made the ruling only after allowing\n\nboth  sides  to argue  their  points  orally.   Fusco's  main\n\nobjection was that  the taped scene on the test track did not\n\nadequately  replicate the conditions of the accident.  Merely\n\nto state  the obvious, no  one claimed that the  accident had\n\noccurred when a  jury-rigged cotter pin  was pulled from  the\n\nball stud by a wire leading into the passenger seat.  Another\n\n                             -9-\n\nfacially obvious difference  is that the test car  was driven\n\nby an experienced driver who expected the break to occur.  \n\n     General Motors readily admitted that the conditions were\n\nnot  the same but argued that the tape was admissible to show\n\ngeneral scientific  principles and  that the  dissimilarities\n\nwent  to  weight and  not  admissibility.4   It  repeats this\n\nargument on appeal,  adding that under Fed. R.  Evid. 403 the\n\nburden was  upon Fusco (as  the opponent of the  evidence) to\n\nshow that prejudice substantially outweighed probative value.\n\nGeneral Motors says that not only did Fusco fail to show that\n\nthe dissimilarities were important but, in addition,  General\n\nMotors'  own experts would have said that the dissimilarities\n\nwere not significant.\n\n     The problems raised  by demonstrations of this  kind are\n\ninteresting  and important.  The test track replication shown\n\non the driving tapes (this court was furnished with copies of\n\nthe tapes) is vivid and pertinent: one sees, in a way that no\n\nwords could capture, the tire wheel flip out of alignment and\n\nthe tire then dragging on the  track.  The impression left is\n\nthat such an  accident would leave a tire  streak, as claimed\n\n                    \n\n     4General Motors does  not claim that the  indoor portion\nof the  tape was admissible independently; and indeed most of\nthe indoor portion  was merely to lay the  groundwork for the\ntest.   The indoor portion did  show Ulman using a  straw, in\nplace of  the stud, to show how the  stud could be bent by an\nimpact on the  rear portion of the wheel,  but General Motors\ndoes  not claim that this  brief sequence justified the tape,\nand  it could  easily have  been replicated  in court  with a\nmock-up.\n\n                             -10-\n\nby General Motors, and  that the car  is more likely to  flop\n\nand drag  than to veer  sharply off the  road.  A  lay juror,\n\nasked whether  a look  at the tapes  would be  helpful, would\n\nlikely answer yes.\n\n     The  case law  in this  area  is muddled,  as one  might\n\nexpect, but the tendency of the court is to  treat this class\n\nof demonstrative evidence more skeptically than would the lay\n\njuror.  The  concern lies not with  use of tape or  film (the\n\nissue would  be largely the same if  the jurors were taken to\n\nthe test  track  for  a  live  demonstration)  but  with  the\n\ndeliberate recreation  of an event  under staged  conditions.\n\nWhere  that  recreation  could easily  seem  to  resemble the\n\nactual occurrence, courts have feared  that the jurors may be\n\nmisled because they do not fully appreciate how variations in\n\nthe   surrounding   conditions,  as   between   the  original\n\noccurrence and the staged event, can alter the outcome.\n\n     In such  cases the  solution of  many courts,  including\n\nthis  one,  has been  to call  for substantial  similarity in\n\nconditions,  or to stress  the great discretion  of the trial\n\njudge to exclude the evidence  where similarity is not shown,\n\nor both.  E.g.. Swajian v.  General Motors, 916 F.2d 31  (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1990); see  1 J.  Strong, McCormick  on Evidence    202\n                                                      \n\n(1992) (collecting cases,  a number of which  involve General\n\nMotors).   This case  law largely  undercuts General  Motors'\n\nclaim that the burden lay with Fusco to show undue prejudice;\n\n                             -11-\n\ninstead,  courts have created  a doctrine, predating  and now\n\nloosely  appended to Rule  403, that requires  a foundational\n\nshowing of  substantial  similarity in  circumstances.    Cf.\n                                                             \n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2786\n                                            \n\n(1993)  (reliability requirement  for  expert testimony  held\n\nimplicit in Rule 702).\n\n     Of course  the concept  of substantial  similarity is  a\n\nflexible  one, and  ought  to  be, for  the  benefits of  the\n\ndemonstration and  the dangers  of misleading  the jury  will\n\nvary greatly  depending upon  the facts.   We think  that the\n\ntrial judge enjoys  great discretion in this area.   But here\n\nthe circumstances  were not similar: as in  Swajian, the test\n                                                   \n\noccurred in  controlled conditions,  on a  test track  with a\n\ndriver expecting the occurrence, and with a doctored piece of\n\nequipment rather than  one that actually broke.   916 F.2d at\n\n36.   General  Motors does  not  seriously claim  substantial\n\nsimilarity,  despite  its  reference  to  the  testimony  its\n\nexperts would have given.\n\n     Instead,  General Motors says  that the tapes  here were\n\ndesigned  not  to   recreate  the  accident  but   rather  to\n\nillustrate  general \"scientific  principles,\" presumably  the\n\nbehavior of a car with a disconnected ball stud.  Admittedly,\n\n\"[w]hen this  [scientific  principles]  label  is  attached,\"\n\ncourts often do  ask not about  similarity of conditions  but\n\nonly whether  the test  was properly  conducted.   McCormick,\n                                                            \n\n                             -12-\n\nsupra, at 866.  We think it would be a  great stretch to call\n     \n\nthe tapes an abstract demonstration of scientific principles,\n\nbut the critical point  is not one of labels.   The issue for\n\nus  is whether  the demonstration  is  sufficiently close  in\n\nappearance to  the original accident  to create  the risk  of\n\nmisunderstanding by the jury, for  it is that risk that gives\n\nrise to the special requirement to show similar conditions.5\n\n     Here the test track demonstration was rife with the risk\n\nof  misunderstanding.   Whatever  Fusco's counsel  or experts\n\nsaid  to the jury about differing circumstances, the drama of\n\nthe filmed recreation could easily  overcome the logic of the\n\ndistinctions.   Our  case  is  scarcely  different  than  the\n\nrecreation  in Swajian  involving  a broken  rear  axle in  a\n                      \n\nsimilarly staged demonstration  by General Motors.   We there\n\naffirmed  the  trial  judge's  exclusion  of  such  evidence,\n\npointing to  \"the  sound and  broad discretion  of the  trial\n\njudge\" in policing  such videotaped evidence. Id. at  36.  We\n                                                 \n\nreaffirm here the principle and the result.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The second issue on appeal  concerns the decision of the\n\ntrial  judge to exclude  an additional videotape  prepared by\n\n                    \n\n     5Scientific principles,  when demonstrated  in a  fairly\nabstract  way, are  quite  unlikely to  be confused  with the\nevents  on trial.   The more troublesome  cases, however, are\nones  like this one where some principles of some kind may be\ndemonstrated but  in a  fashion that looks  very much  like a\nrecreation of the event that gave rise to the trial.\n\n                             -13-\n\nGeneral Motors  after the first  trial ended in a  hung jury.\n\nThis tape  was prepared on  October 2, 1993, and  provided to\n\nFusco on October  14, 1993, approximately three  months after\n\nthe  first trial and one  month before the  second.  The tape\n\nshows a slow motion, close-up  impact fracture of a ball stud\n\nfilmed at close  range.  On the  tape one sees the  stud bend\n\nand separate from the ball.  There is no commentary.\n\n     After  receiving the  tape, Fusco  immediately moved  in\n                                                             \n\nlimine to exclude it, together with  a newly created \"survey\"\n      \n\nof the accident  site that General Motors had  tendered.  The\n\ndistrict court  allowed the survey to  be used but ruled that\n\nthe tape would not be admissible, stating:\n\n          With  regard  to  the importance  of  the\n          exhibit  to  the   defendant,  the  Court\n          cannot  fathom  how defendant  could  not\n          present  a  complete  case  to  the  jury\n          without  the videotape  as defendant  has\n          already  done  so  at  the  first  trial.\n          Finally,  the Court  does not  doubt that\n          plaintiff would have a  difficult time to\n          formulate  a  proper response  given  the\n          obvious lack of time  before retrial.  It\n          is primarily  for this  reason the  Court\n          obviates  defendant  from  submitting the\n          videotape exhibit.\n\n     On  appeal,  General  Motors does  not  spend  much time\n\nexplaining the significance of the tape, saying only that  it\n\nwas \"to show  how the  part in  question bends  prior to  and\n\nduring  an  overload  situation.\"   Instead,  General  Motors\n\nargues with some force that the district judge has no general\n\nauthority  to  exclude  exhibits  merely  because  their last\n\n                             -14-\n\nminute  appearance will  inconvenience  or  burden the  other\n\nside.    This exclusion,  says  General  Motors, was  not  an\n\nexercise of the  court's accustomed power over  discovery but\n\nan interference with  the right of counsel  to offer evidence\n\nat trial.\n\n     Of course, a trial court could readily exclude a witness\n\nor  exhibit if  some previous  order had  set a  deadline for\n\nidentification and the proponent  had without adequate excuse\n\nfailed to list the witness or exhibit.  But here the deadline\n\nfor listing exhibits at the second trial did not expire until\n\none week before trial, well after the tape was tendered.  Nor\n\nis there  any general rule prohibiting a  party from offering\n\nnew evidence  at a second  trial, although few  cases address\n\nthe  issue.   See  Lauritzen v.  Atlantic Greyhound  Corp., 8\n                                                          \n\nF.R.D. 237, 238  (E.D. Tenn. 1948), aff'd 182  F.2d. 840 (6th\n                                         \n\nCir. 1950).  In fact, the district court here allowed General\n\nMotors  to introduce  at  the second  trial  a newly  created\n\nsurvey of the accident site.\n\n     Nevertheless, we think  that the tape did  implicate the\n\ndistrict court's authority over discovery.   The tape was not\n\na stand alone exhibit: it made  sense only in the context  of\n\nexpert testimony to be offered by General Motors.   An expert\n\nor experts would  have had to explain the  tape's meaning and\n\nwould have used it to bolster inferences drawn by the expert.\n\nIndeed, even now it is not clear to us precisely how the tape\n\n                             -15-\n\nwas expected  to help  General Motors'  experts, although  we\n\nwill   assume  that  it   was  either  intended   to  counter\n\nplaintiffs' expert analysis or to make more plausible General\n\nMotors'  account of  how  the ball  stud  retrieved from  the\n\naccident was actually damaged.\n\n     The  connection of the tape  to discovery now comes into\n\nview.    Fusco's   discovery  had  included  a   request  for\n\nproduction of \"[a]ny and all  . . . videotapes\" taken by, for\n\nor for the benefit of Ulman, Willis, and \"any and  all expert\n\nconsultants.\"   If the  tape had existed  when General Motors\n\nfirst responded to  this request, the tape would  have had to\n\nbe  produced.   We  think  that the  duty  of supplementation\n\nspecified  in Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 26(e)  also required  General\n\nMotors seasonably to produce any later developed videotape of\n\nany importance intended for use by its expert at trial.\n\n     The \"duty to supplement\" provisions are not  as clear as\n\nthey might be,  and the authorities are  surprisingly sparse.\n\nA  party is  required  to supplement--that  is, update--prior\n\nresponses   only  in  limited  instances  but  they  include,\n\npertinently, responses  (1) concerning \"the substance\" of the\n\nexpert's testimony and  (2) where new information  exists and\n\nfailure  to amend  would  comprise  \"a knowing  concealment.\"\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 26(e)(1),  (2).   We  have read  Rule 26(e)\n\ngenerously, in light  of its dual purposes, the \"narrowing of\n\n                             -16-\n\nissues  and  elimination  of  surprise.\"    Johnson  v.  H.K.\n                                                             \n\nWebster, Inc. 775 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1985).6\n             \n\n       We  think that  these  clauses  are  broad  enough  to\n\nembrace the tape in  this case.  It was  closely connected to\n\nthe expert's testimony, it was not previously known to Fusco,\n\nand   General  Motors  can   hardly  describe  the   tape  as\n\nunimportant  since it claims  that the exclusion  of the tape\n\nundermined the entire trial.  Thus we think that the tape was\n\ncovered  by General Motors'  obligation to produce  under the\n\ndiscovery rules.   In our view--and this is the final step in\n\nour reasoning--the  discovery obligation carries  with it the\n\nimplicit  authority of  the district  court  to exclude  such\n\nmaterials when not timely produced even if there was no rigid\n                         \n\ndeadline for production.\n\n     There  is  no  suggestion that  General  Motors  delayed\n\nunduly  if  one  counts  only  the  brief delay  between  the\n\ncreation of the tape and its tender to Fusco.   But practical\n\nconsiderations  suggest that the authority of the trial judge\n\nmust  be  broader:  otherwise  it  would  count  as  adequate\n\nsupplementation to create a critical new expert exhibit a day\n\nbefore trial and  tender it on the  morning of trial.   It is\n\n                    \n\n     6The   knowing-concealment  clause   does  not   require\nfraudulent  intent; rather it is designed  to protect a party\nwho reasonably  believes \"that  the change that  has made  an\nanswer no longer accurate is known to his opponent or that it\nis a matter  of no importance.\"   Fortino v. Quasar  Co., 950\n                                                        \nF.2d 389, 396 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n                             -17-\n\ncommon experience that experts,  like lawyers themselves, may\n\nincrease their  efforts as  trial approaches,  and we  do not\n\nsuggest any general  bar to an exhibit created  in good faith\n\nfor the expert after initial discovery.  But we do think that\n\nwhere a discovery request for the expert's materials has been\n\nmade, the later attempt to  add new exhibits designed for the\n\nexpert's use at trial is subject to reasonable supervision by\n\nthe trial judge.\n\n     This circuit adopted this very principle in Thibeault v.\n                                                          \n\nSquare D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 245 (1st Cir. 1992).  The factual\n            \n\ndifferences  between that  case and  this one  relate to  the\n\nsound  exercise of  the  authority  to  exclude and  not  its\n\nexistence.  We emphasize that  our ruling in Thibeault and in\n                                                      \n\nthis  case rests  on  the existence  of a  specific discovery\n\nrequest  and the  explicit duty  to supplement  it  in timely\n\nfashion.  Absent some such obligation, we  agree with General\n\nMotors  that courts  cannot ordinarily  tell  counsel not  to\n\noffer evidence just because the other  side will be surprised\n\nand disadvantaged.       Once   the   court's   authority  to\n\nexclude here is conceded, its exercise in this case cannot be\n\nfaulted.   The  impact tape was  a technical  experiment made\n\nknown to Fusco barely  a month before trial.  To  prepare for\n\ncross-examination might  have required  further discovery  by\n\nFusco of one  or more  of the defense  witnesses, as well  as\n\nadditional preparation by  Fusco's experts.  The  tape itself\n\n                             -18-\n\nis  pictures without words; even to determine the precise use\n\nGeneral Motors planned to make of it would have required more\n\ninformation.  The  district court was  entitled to find  that\n\nthe tape would have compromised Fusco's pretrial preparations\n\nand   that  the   supplementation  came   too   late  to   be\n\n\"seasonable.\"\n\n                             IV.\n\n     General Motors' remaining claim of error also relates to\n\nthe district court's authority over discovery.   At the first\n\ntrial  Fusco's  experts made  use  of  the  broken ball  stud\n\nrecovered  from Fusco's  car  and offered  Walson's testimony\n\nbased  on  his  examination  of  the  part  under  a scanning\n\nelectron microscope.   That part, in Fusco's  possession, was\n\navailable to General  Motors prior to the first  trial but it\n\nchose not to make such an examination of its own.  In theory,\n\nstudy of the  surface of the broken part might  cast light on\n\nwhether the part had broken from impact or fatigue.\n\n     Taking  note of Walson's  testimony in the  first trial,\n\nGeneral  Motors in preparation for the second trial requested\n\nthat the  part, and an  additional Pontiac ball stud  used by\n\nWalson for  comparison, be  made  available to  it.   General\n\nMotors wanted  its own metallurgist  to make a  similar, non-\n\ndestructive  examination  by scanning  electron  microscope.7\n\n                    \n\n     7General  Motors proposed to have one of its first-trial\nexperts  conduct the examination  but, when  Fusco questioned\nhis qualifications,  General Motors proposed to  have another\n\n                             -19-\n\nFusco refused to  produce the parts and General  Motors moved\n\nto compel  production.  The  district court wrote  a ten-page\n\norder denying General Motors' motion.  \n\n     In its order, the court said that General Motors knew as\n\nearly as  May 1991 that  Fusco intended to offer  evidence of\n\nexamination  by scanning electron microscope.  The court also\n\nsaid that the new examination  was intended as the  predicate\n\nfor new expert testimony by General Motors, testimony unknown\n\nto Fusco when General Motors' experts  were deposed, and that\n\nthis last minute  addition imposed an unfair burden  on Fusco\n\non the eve of the second  trial.  The court also referred  to\n\nGeneral Motors' development of new evidence on the eve of the\n\nfirst trial,  which the court  had permitted over  protest by\n\nFusco.   Finally, it  expressed concern  that General  Motors\n\nsought  to overwhelm plaintiff  with its unlimited  legal and\n\nfinancial resources.\n\n     There is no doubt here of the district court's authority\n\nto deny further discovery.   As noted above, no automatic bar\n\nexists  against  new evidence  at  a  second  trial; but  the\n\ndiscovery deadline  had long  since passed  and the  district\n\ncourt had  no automatic  obligation to  reopen the  discovery\n\nperiod.  E.g., Dabney v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 761 F.2d 494,\n                                              \n\n                    \n\nexpert whose qualifications were conceded  participate in the\nexamination  and testify  at trial.   Whether  one  views the\ntestimony as  that of  a first-trial expert  or a  new expert\ndoes not greatly affect the matter.\n\n                             -20-\n\n498  (8th Cir.),  cert. denied,  474  U.S. 904  (1985).   The\n                              \n\nmatter  was one  for  the informed  discretion  of the  trial\n\njudge, and the  breadth of that  discretion in managing  pre-\n\ntrial mechanics and  discovery is very great.   E.g., Fashion\n                                                             \n\nHouse, Inc.  v. K Mart Corp.,  892 F.2d 1076, 1082  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1989); Mack  v. Great  Atlantic &amp; Pacific  Tea Co.,  871 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n179, 186-87 (1st Cir. 1989).  Measured  against this standard\n\nof review,  the district  court's quite  thorough explanation\n\nfor denying production easily passes muster.\n\n     Our own review of the record does not suggest to us that\n\nGeneral Motors'  request was made  in bad faith  or reflected\n\nany attempt  to abuse its  financial power.  Fusco  after all\n\nwas  seeking  $8  million,  and  defense  counsel  apparently\n\nperceived in  the first trial  that the testimony  by Fusco's\n\nexpert about  the scanning  electron microscope  carried some\n\nweight.  But it was primarily  for the trial judge to balance\n\nthe  factors, such  as  the timing  of  the request,  General\n\nMotors'  earlier knowledge, the  possible burden on  Fusco of\n\npreparing to confront a new expert, and the importance of the\n\ntestimony.   The balance struck  here by the trial  judge was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -21-\n",

Carol Fusco was injured in a car\n                          \n\naccident and brought  suit against General Motors,  the car's\n\nmanufacturer.  A jury awarded Fusco $1 million in damages and\n\nGeneral Motors has appealed, challenging rulings on  evidence\n\nand discovery made by the district judge.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     On December  15,  1986, Fusco  was  driving her  car,  a\n\nChevrolet  Chevette, near  Pelham, New  Hampshire.   Her  car\n\nsuddenly  left  the  roadway,  slid   across  an  ice-covered\n\nembankment,  and hit  a telephone  pole  somewhere along  the\n\nfront left side of the car.  Fusco was injured.\n\n     Fusco brought suit against General Motors in state court\n\nin  New  Hampshire, claiming  that  a  key component  in  the\n\nsteering system--the front left  \"ball stud\"--had broken from\n\nmetal  fatigue  and  caused the  disaster.1    General Motors\n\nremoved the  case  to federal  district  court and  took  the\n\nposition that  the ball stud  had not been  the cause  of the\n\naccident  but  rather  had fractured  when  the  car hit  the\n\ntelephone  pole.   A  jury  trial,  begun  on July  7,  1992,\n\nresulted in  an evenly  divided hung  jury, and  the district\n\ncourt promptly ordered a second trial for November 16, 1992.\n\n                    \n\n     1It appears that  the ball is a spherical  object with a\nprotruding stud; that the ball and stud together form part of\nthe  elaborate connection (via the tie rod and steering gear)\nbetween  the tire wheel or  axle and the  steering wheel.  If\nthe  stud  breaks  entirely,  the tire  wheel  is  no  longer\ncontrolled by the steering wheel.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     At the  second trial Fusco offered  eyewitness testimony\n\nthat her car had abruptly veered off the highway and collided\n\nwith a telephone pole.  A state trooper  who arrived first at\n\nthe accident testified  that the car was  resting against the\n\npole near the  hinge pillar on the driver's  side, a location\n\nbetween the  door and the  left front fender.   Fusco offered\n\ntwo  experts (Robert Walson  and Carl  Thelin) who,  based in\n\npart on  this testimony and  their examination of  the broken\n\nball stud, concluded that  metal fatigue had caused  the stud\n\nto break, causing the steering  apparatus to fail and the car\n\nto veer into the pole.\n\n     Walson,  a metallurgist,  testified that the  surface of\n\nthe   broken   ball   stud  taken   from   Fusco's   car  was\n\ncharacteristic of a fatigue, rather than an impact, fracture.\n\nHe  supported his  opinion  in  several  ways  including  his\n\npretrial examination of the surface  of the ball stud under a\n\nscanning electron microscope; he was fiercely  cross-examined\n\nby  General  Motors  about  this  examination.    Thelin,  an\n\nautomotive  engineer, testified  that General  Motors' design\n\nand quality control of the  ball stud were inadequate.  Based\n\non partial reconstruction of the accident, he also challenged\n\nGeneral Motors' argument that the telephone pole impact could\n\nhave broken the ball stud.\n\n     General Motors' case included testimony from  its expert\n\nJerry  Chiddister who reconstructed the accident based on his\n\n                             -3-\n\nexperience with many  crash tests.  In his  view, the car had\n\n\"sideslipped\" into  the telephone  pole, causing  the car  to\n\nslide along  the pole starting  at the front left  fender and\n\nending with the pole lying next to the door hinge column.  He\n\nopined that on  its travel down the side of the car, the pole\n\nhit the front left tire and the impact broke the ball stud, a\n\npredictable  occurrence given the estimated speed of the car.\n\nHad the  stud broken before  the car veered,  Chiddister said\n\nthat there would  have been a  heavy black tire  mark on  the\n\nroad  because the uncontrolled tire would have dragged as the\n\ncar slid off course.\n\n     Kirk  Ulman,  another General  Motors  expert, testified\n\nthat he had examined  the ball stud itself.  He explained why\n\nthe  location of the  break (at  the neck  of the  stud), the\n\nsurface  of the break (grainy  with chevron marks), and other\n\ncharacteristics meant  that impact  and not  fatigue was  the\n\ncause.   James Willis, who worked in General Motors' facility\n\nthat made the steering gear, testified to quality control and\n\nthe  nature of simulated  fatigue fractures.   Ray Schultz, a\n\nmetallurgist, confirmed Ulman's testimony on key points.\n\n     The  jury rendered  a  verdict  in  favor of  Fusco  and\n\nawarded  her $1  million  in damages.    General Motors  then\n\nappealed.  In its brief General Motors does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency  of  Fusco's  evidence  but  confines  itself  to\n\ncontesting several evidentiary and discovery rulings, rulings\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat can  only  be understood  against  the backdrop  of  the\n\ntestimony  already described.  Although these claims of error\n\nare not frivolous, we do not think that  any of them warrants\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                             II.\n\n     General  Motors' first  claim  on  appeal  is  that  the\n\ndistrict  court erred in  ruling, prior  to the  first trial,\n\nthat two videotapes--the  \"driving tapes\"--were inadmissible.\n\nThe main tape  made in  1992 has  two parts.   In the  indoor\n\npart, Ulman  used a  car mounted  on a  lift  to display  the\n\nfunction of the  ball stud and tie rod and showed how in this\n\ndemonstration  the connection between  the stud and  the tire\n\nwheel or axle had  been altered in the  test vehicle so  that\n\nthe stud could be released deliberately from inside the car.\n\n     In the  outdoor part,  filmed at  a General Motors  test\n\ntrack, Ulman drove the Chevette while Willis,  sitting in the\n\npassenger  seat, intentionally disconnected  the tie rod from\n\nthe tire  wheel.  The film  showed that, when  the left wheel\n\nfinally  separated from  the rod,  the  wheel flopped  out of\n\nalignment with  the right  wheel and  dragged on  the highway\n\napparently creating a  long black skid mark.  The car did not\n\nveer out of  control or  hit the  track barrier.   The  other\n\ntape, made  in  1986,  simply  showed a  similar  test  track\n\ndemonstration with a  different driver and passenger.   Thus,\n\n                             -5-\n\nthere is no need for  an independent discussion of this tape.\n\n     When General Motors produced the tapes to Fusco in  June\n\n1992, shortly before the first  trial, Fusco made a motion in\n                                                             \n\nlimine  to  exclude   them,  arguing  that  the   test  track\n      \n\nconditions did not  duplicate the conditions that  existed at\n\nthe time  of the actual accident.  In  an oral ruling on July\n\n8,  1992,  the  trial judge  granted  the  motion.   Although\n\nGeneral Motors argues  that the  exclusion of  the tapes  was\n\nerror, it  did not  seek to  offer the  tapes  at the  second\n\ntrial.\n\n     Seizing  on  this omission,  Fusco  argues that  General\n\nMotors has waived  its right to argue that  the exclusion was\n\nerror.   Fusco  points to  cases  holding that  an in  limine\n                                                             \n\nruling on evidence  may not be reviewed on  appeal unless the\n\noffer  or  objection  is renewed  when  evidence  is actually\n\npresented at trial.   This court has made general  statements\n\nto this  effect, e.g., United States v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592213\"><a href=\"/opinion/592213/united-states-v-daniel-l-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992),  in cases  where  the in  limine motion  to\n                                                  \n\nexclude was denied and the opponent of the evidence failed to\n\nrenew the objection at trial. We  have found no case in  this\n\ncircuit, however,  where an in  limine motion to  exclude was\n                                      \n\ngranted  and the  proponent  of the  evidence, by  failing to\n\nrenew the offer at trial, was found to have waived the issue.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     Where an  objection to  evidence has  been overruled  in\n                                                             \n\nlimine,  it makes  sense  to require  that  the objection  be\n      \n\nrenewed at trial.  However  definite the denial of the motion\n\nto  exclude  prior to  trial,  it  is  child's play  for  the\n\nopponent  of the  evidence  to renew  the objection  when the\n\nevidence  is  actually  offered; and  requiring  this renewal\n\ngives the trial judge a  chance to reconsider the ruling with\n\nthe concrete  evidence presented in the actual context of the\n\ntrial.  The only criticism one might offer of the requirement\n\nis that  the Federal  Rules of Evidence  say nothing  about a\n\nsecond  objection,2 but any practiced trial lawyer knows that\n\nmuch of the law of evidence is not contained in these written\n\nrules.\n\n     On  the  other  hand,  where  the  motion  in limine  is\n                                                         \n\ngranted, and the  proponent of the evidence is  told that the\n\nevidence  will not be  admitted, the situation  is different.\n\nTo require that the evidence  be offered again at trial would\n\ncertainly give the trial court  a second chance, but doing so\n\ncan  hardly be  described  as  easy:   on  the contrary,  the\n\nproponent   would  have  to   engage  in  the   wasteful  and\n\ninconvenient  task  of  summoning   witnesses  or  organizing\n\n                    \n\n     2The Federal Rules of Evidence do  not address in limine\n                                                             \nmotions at all.   Instead the rules require  in general terms\nthat,  to  preserve a  ruling  on  evidence  for appeal,  the\nproponent  of evidence make its  substance known to the court\nand an opponent make known  the objection to the evidence and\nthe ground of the objection.  Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).\n\n                             -7-\n\ndemonstrative evidence  that the  proponent has  already been\n\ntold not to  offer.  Indeed, in many cases the prior grant of\n\nthe  in limine  motion would  make it  improper to  call such\n              \n\nwitnesses  without prior permission.  All the proponent could\n\ndo would be  to line up the  witnesses at trial and  then ask\n\npermission.\n\n     Although a  symmetrical rule  may be  preferable if  all\n\nelse is  equal, all else  is not equal  here.  Where  a court\n\nrules in limine  that certain  evidence is  excluded but  the\n               \n\nruling is merely  tentative or qualified, then  the proponent\n\nmight well have  to offer the evidence  at trial in order  to\n\npreserve an appeal on the issue.   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).  But\n\nwhere  the pretrial  proffer  is  adequate  and  evidence  is\n\nexcluded unconditionally by  a pretrial order, then  we think\n\nthat the  proponent has  preserved the  issue for appeal  and\n\n(other  circumstances  being unchanged)  need  not  bring the\n\nwitness  to court  and proffer  the evidence again  at trial.\n\nSee  McQuaig  v.

Fed. R.\nEvid. 103(a).   There  may also  be cases  where a  change in\ncircum-stances,  after the in limine ruling but before trial,\n                                    \nmight make it  unreasonable for the proponent to  rely on the\nsolely in  limine ruling to  preserve the issue (a  new basis\n                 \nfor admissibility might  arise or the court's  initial reason\nfor exclusion might be mooted).\n\n                             -8-\n\norder preceded the  first trial because no one  disputes that\n\nthe same order governed the second trial.\n\n     Needless  to say, most district judges are very cautious\n\nabout making a definitive ruling in limine that evidence will\n                                          \n\nnot be received at trial.  Trial judges know better than most\n\nthat many issues  are best resolved in context  and only when\n\nfinally necessary.   But here, as happens from  time to time,\n\nthe trial judge did rule definitively that the evidence would\n\nnot be  admitted.  The  proffer was adequate since  the tapes\n\nwere apparently  available to  the court.   And no  change in\n\ncircumstances  occurred after the in limine ruling that might\n                                           \n\nhave  affected the controlling  ground for exclusion  or cast\n\nany  doubt on  the trial  judge's intention  to abide  by the\n\noriginal ruling.\n\n     Thus we turn  to the merits of the  ruling excluding the\n\ndriving tapes.  The oral ruling was terse (\"You don't have to\n\nargue it.   I'm not  going to let  it in.\") but  the district\n\njudge had a written motion from Fusco, and a written response\n\nfrom  General Motors, and made the ruling only after allowing\n\nboth  sides  to argue  their  points  orally.   Fusco's  main\n\nobjection was that  the taped scene on the test track did not\n\nadequately  replicate the conditions of the accident.  Merely\n\nto state  the obvious, no  one claimed that the  accident had\n\noccurred when a  jury-rigged cotter pin  was pulled from  the\n\nball stud by a wire leading into the passenger seat.  Another\n\n                             -9-\n\nfacially obvious difference  is that the test car  was driven\n\nby an experienced driver who expected the break to occur.  \n\n     General Motors readily admitted that the conditions were\n\nnot  the same but argued that the tape was admissible to show\n\ngeneral scientific  principles and  that the  dissimilarities\n\nwent  to  weight and  not  admissibility.4   It  repeats this\n\nargument on appeal,  adding that under Fed. R.  Evid. 403 the\n\nburden was  upon Fusco (as  the opponent of the  evidence) to\n\nshow that prejudice substantially outweighed probative value.\n\nGeneral Motors says that not only did Fusco fail to show that\n\nthe dissimilarities were important but, in addition,  General\n\nMotors'  own experts would have said that the dissimilarities\n\nwere not significant.\n\n     The problems raised  by demonstrations of this  kind are\n\ninteresting  and important.  The test track replication shown\n\non the driving tapes (this court was furnished with copies of\n\nthe tapes) is vivid and pertinent: one sees, in a way that no\n\nwords could capture, the tire wheel flip out of alignment and\n\nthe tire then dragging on the  track.  The impression left is\n\nthat such an  accident would leave a tire  streak, as claimed\n\n                    \n\n     4General Motors does  not claim that the  indoor portion\nof the  tape was admissible independently; and indeed most of\nthe indoor portion  was merely to lay the  groundwork for the\ntest.   The indoor portion did  show Ulman using a  straw, in\nplace of  the stud, to show how the  stud could be bent by an\nimpact on the  rear portion of the wheel,  but General Motors\ndoes  not claim that this  brief sequence justified the tape,\nand  it could  easily have  been replicated  in court  with a\nmock-up.\n\n                             -10-\n\nby General Motors, and  that the car  is more likely to  flop\n\nand drag  than to veer  sharply off the  road.  A  lay juror,\n\nasked whether  a look  at the tapes  would be  helpful, would\n\nlikely answer yes.\n\n     The  case law  in this  area  is muddled,  as one  might\n\nexpect, but the tendency of the court is to  treat this class\n\nof demonstrative evidence more skeptically than would the lay\n\njuror.  The  concern lies not with  use of tape or  film (the\n\nissue would  be largely the same if  the jurors were taken to\n\nthe test  track  for  a  live  demonstration)  but  with  the\n\ndeliberate recreation  of an event  under staged  conditions.\n\nWhere  that  recreation  could easily  seem  to  resemble the\n\nactual occurrence, courts have feared  that the jurors may be\n\nmisled because they do not fully appreciate how variations in\n\nthe   surrounding   conditions,  as   between   the  original\n\noccurrence and the staged event, can alter the outcome.\n\n     In such  cases the  solution of  many courts,  including\n\nthis  one,  has been  to call  for substantial  similarity in\n\nconditions,  or to stress  the great discretion  of the trial\n\njudge to exclude the evidence  where similarity is not shown,\n\nor both.

We think  that the\n\ntrial judge enjoys  great discretion in this area.   But here\n\nthe circumstances  were not similar: as in  Swajian, the test\n                                                   \n\noccurred in  controlled conditions,  on a  test track  with a\n\ndriver expecting the occurrence, and with a doctored piece of\n\nequipment rather than  one that actually broke.   916 F.2d at\n\n36.   General  Motors does  not  seriously claim  substantial\n\nsimilarity,  despite  its  reference  to  the  testimony  its\n\nexperts would have given.\n\n     Instead,  General Motors says  that the tapes  here were\n\ndesigned  not  to   recreate  the  accident  but   rather  to\n\nillustrate  general \"scientific  principles,\" presumably  the\n\nbehavior of a car with a disconnected ball stud.  Admittedly,\n\n\"[w]hen this  [scientific  principles]  label  is  attached,\"\n\ncourts often do  ask not about  similarity of conditions  but\n\nonly whether  the test  was properly  conducted.

We think it would be a  great stretch to call\n     \n\nthe tapes an abstract demonstration of scientific principles,\n\nbut the critical point  is not one of labels.   The issue for\n\nus  is whether  the demonstration  is  sufficiently close  in\n\nappearance to  the original accident  to create  the risk  of\n\nmisunderstanding by the jury, for  it is that risk that gives\n\nrise to the special requirement to show similar conditions.5\n\n     Here the test track demonstration was rife with the risk\n\nof  misunderstanding.   Whatever  Fusco's counsel  or experts\n\nsaid  to the jury about differing circumstances, the drama of\n\nthe filmed recreation could easily  overcome the logic of the\n\ndistinctions.   Our  case  is  scarcely  different  than  the\n\nrecreation  in Swajian  involving  a broken  rear  axle in  a\n                      \n\nsimilarly staged demonstration  by General Motors.

We\n                                                 \n\nreaffirm here the principle and the result.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The second issue on appeal  concerns the decision of the\n\ntrial  judge to exclude  an additional videotape  prepared by\n\n                    \n\n     5Scientific principles,  when demonstrated  in a  fairly\nabstract  way, are  quite  unlikely to  be confused  with the\nevents  on trial.   The more troublesome  cases, however, are\nones  like this one where some principles of some kind may be\ndemonstrated but  in a  fashion that looks  very much  like a\nrecreation of the event that gave rise to the trial.\n\n                             -13-\n\nGeneral Motors  after the first  trial ended in a  hung jury.\n\nThis tape  was prepared on  October 2, 1993, and  provided to\n\nFusco on October  14, 1993, approximately three  months after\n\nthe  first trial and one  month before the  second.  The tape\n\nshows a slow motion, close-up  impact fracture of a ball stud\n\nfilmed at close  range.  On the  tape one sees the  stud bend\n\nand separate from the ball.  There is no commentary.\n\n     After  receiving the  tape, Fusco  immediately moved  in\n                                                             \n\nlimine to exclude it, together with  a newly created \"survey\"\n      \n\nof the accident  site that General Motors had  tendered.  The\n\ndistrict court  allowed the survey to  be used but ruled that\n\nthe tape would not be admissible, stating:\n\n          With  regard  to  the importance  of  the\n          exhibit  to  the   defendant,  the  Court\n          cannot  fathom  how defendant  could  not\n          present  a  complete  case  to  the  jury\n          without  the videotape  as defendant  has\n          already  done  so  at  the  first  trial.\n          Finally,  the Court  does not  doubt that\n          plaintiff would have a  difficult time to\n          formulate  a  proper response  given  the\n          obvious lack of time  before retrial.  It\n          is primarily  for this  reason the  Court\n          obviates  defendant  from  submitting the\n          videotape exhibit.\n\n     On  appeal,  General  Motors does  not  spend  much time\n\nexplaining the significance of the tape, saying only that  it\n\nwas \"to show  how the  part in  question bends  prior to  and\n\nduring  an  overload  situation.\"   Instead,  General  Motors\n\nargues with some force that the district judge has no general\n\nauthority  to  exclude  exhibits  merely  because  their last\n\n                             -14-\n\nminute  appearance will  inconvenience  or  burden the  other\n\nside.    This exclusion,  says  General  Motors, was  not  an\n\nexercise of the  court's accustomed power over  discovery but\n\nan interference with  the right of counsel  to offer evidence\n\nat trial.\n\n     Of course, a trial court could readily exclude a witness\n\nor  exhibit if  some previous  order had  set a  deadline for\n\nidentification and the proponent  had without adequate excuse\n\nfailed to list the witness or exhibit.  But here the deadline\n\nfor listing exhibits at the second trial did not expire until\n\none week before trial, well after the tape was tendered.  Nor\n\nis there  any general rule prohibiting a  party from offering\n\nnew evidence  at a second  trial, although few  cases address\n\nthe  issue.   See  Lauritzen v.  Atlantic Greyhound  Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n                                                          \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238  (E.D.

In fact, the district court here allowed General\n\nMotors  to introduce  at  the second  trial  a newly  created\n\nsurvey of the accident site.\n\n     Nevertheless, we think  that the tape did  implicate the\n\ndistrict court's authority over discovery.   The tape was not\n\na stand alone exhibit: it made  sense only in the context  of\n\nexpert testimony to be offered by General Motors.   An expert\n\nor experts would  have had to explain the  tape's meaning and\n\nwould have used it to bolster inferences drawn by the expert.\n\nIndeed, even now it is not clear to us precisely how the tape\n\n                             -15-\n\nwas expected  to help  General Motors'  experts, although  we\n\nwill   assume  that  it   was  either  intended   to  counter\n\nplaintiffs' expert analysis or to make more plausible General\n\nMotors'  account of  how  the ball  stud  retrieved from  the\n\naccident was actually damaged.\n\n     The  connection of the tape  to discovery now comes into\n\nview.    Fusco's   discovery  had  included  a   request  for\n\nproduction of \"[a]ny and all  . . . videotapes\" taken by, for\n\nor for the benefit of Ulman, Willis, and \"any and  all expert\n\nconsultants.\"   If the  tape had existed  when General Motors\n\nfirst responded to  this request, the tape would  have had to\n\nbe  produced.   We  think  that the  duty  of supplementation\n\nspecified  in Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 26(e)  also required  General\n\nMotors seasonably to produce any later developed videotape of\n\nany importance intended for use by its expert at trial.\n\n     The \"duty to supplement\" provisions are not  as clear as\n\nthey might be,  and the authorities are  surprisingly sparse.\n\nA  party is  required  to supplement--that  is, update--prior\n\nresponses   only  in  limited  instances  but  they  include,\n\npertinently, responses  (1) concerning \"the substance\" of the\n\nexpert's testimony and  (2) where new information  exists and\n\nfailure  to amend  would  comprise  \"a knowing  concealment.\"\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 26(e)(1),  (2).   We  have read  Rule 26(e)\n\ngenerously, in light  of its dual purposes, the \"narrowing of\n\n                             -16-\n\nissues  and  elimination  of  surprise.\"    Johnson  v.  H.K.\n                                                             \n\nWebster, Inc. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459885\"><a href=\"/opinion/459885/raymond-johnson-v-hk-webster-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 1985).6\n             \n\n       We  think that  these  clauses  are  broad  enough  to\n\nembrace the tape in  this case.  It was  closely connected to\n\nthe expert's testimony, it was not previously known to Fusco,\n\nand   General  Motors  can   hardly  describe  the   tape  as\n\nunimportant  since it claims  that the exclusion  of the tape\n\nundermined the entire trial.  Thus we think that the tape was\n\ncovered  by General Motors'  obligation to produce  under the\n\ndiscovery rules.   In our view--and this is the final step in\n\nour reasoning--the  discovery obligation carries  with it the\n\nimplicit  authority of  the district  court  to exclude  such\n\nmaterials when not timely produced even if there was no rigid\n                         \n\ndeadline for production.\n\n     There  is  no  suggestion that  General  Motors  delayed\n\nunduly  if  one  counts  only  the  brief delay  between  the\n\ncreation of the tape and its tender to Fusco.   But practical\n\nconsiderations  suggest that the authority of the trial judge\n\nmust  be  broader:  otherwise  it  would  count  as  adequate\n\nsupplementation to create a critical new expert exhibit a day\n\nbefore trial and  tender it on the  morning of trial.   It is\n\n                    \n\n     6The   knowing-concealment  clause   does  not   require\nfraudulent  intent; rather it is designed  to protect a party\nwho reasonably  believes \"that  the change that  has made  an\nanswer no longer accurate is known to his opponent or that it\nis a matter  of no importance.\"   Fortino v. Quasar  Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572713\"><a href=\"/opinion/572713/john-fortino-carl-meyers-and-f-william-schulz-cross-appellants-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span>\n                                                        \n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n                             -17-\n\ncommon experience that experts,  like lawyers themselves, may\n\nincrease their  efforts as  trial approaches,  and we  do not\n\nsuggest any general  bar to an exhibit created  in good faith\n\nfor the expert after initial discovery.  But we do think that\n\nwhere a discovery request for the expert's materials has been\n\nmade, the later attempt to  add new exhibits designed for the\n\nexpert's use at trial is subject to reasonable supervision by\n\nthe trial judge.\n\n     This circuit adopted this very principle in Thibeault v.\n                                                          \n\nSquare D Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (1st Cir. 1992).  The factual\n            \n\ndifferences  between that  case and  this one  relate to  the\n\nsound  exercise of  the  authority  to  exclude and  not  its\n\nexistence.  We emphasize that  our ruling in Thibeault and in\n                                                      \n\nthis  case rests  on  the existence  of a  specific discovery\n\nrequest  and the  explicit duty  to supplement  it  in timely\n\nfashion.  Absent some such obligation, we  agree with General\n\nMotors  that courts  cannot ordinarily  tell  counsel not  to\n\noffer evidence just because the other  side will be surprised\n\nand disadvantaged.       Once   the   court's   authority  to\n\nexclude here is conceded, its exercise in this case cannot be\n\nfaulted.   The  impact tape was  a technical  experiment made\n\nknown to Fusco barely  a month before trial.  To  prepare for\n\ncross-examination might  have required  further discovery  by\n\nFusco of one  or more  of the defense  witnesses, as well  as\n\nadditional preparation by  Fusco's experts.  The  tape itself\n\n                             -18-\n\nis  pictures without words; even to determine the precise use\n\nGeneral Motors planned to make of it would have required more\n\ninformation.  The  district court was  entitled to find  that\n\nthe tape would have compromised Fusco's pretrial preparations\n\nand   that  the   supplementation  came   too   late  to   be\n\n\"seasonable.\"\n\n                             IV.\n\n     General Motors' remaining claim of error also relates to\n\nthe district court's authority over discovery.   At the first\n\ntrial  Fusco's  experts made  use  of  the  broken ball  stud\n\nrecovered  from Fusco's  car  and offered  Walson's testimony\n\nbased  on  his  examination  of  the  part  under  a scanning\n\nelectron microscope.   That part, in Fusco's  possession, was\n\navailable to General  Motors prior to the first  trial but it\n\nchose not to make such an examination of its own.  In theory,\n\nstudy of the  surface of the broken part might  cast light on\n\nwhether the part had broken from impact or fatigue.\n\n     Taking  note of Walson's  testimony in the  first trial,\n\nGeneral  Motors in preparation for the second trial requested\n\nthat the  part, and an  additional Pontiac ball stud  used by\n\nWalson for  comparison, be  made  available to  it.   General\n\nMotors wanted  its own metallurgist  to make a  similar, non-\n\ndestructive  examination  by scanning  electron  microscope.7\n\n                    \n\n     7General  Motors proposed to have one of its first-trial\nexperts  conduct the examination  but, when  Fusco questioned\nhis qualifications,  General Motors proposed to  have another\n\n                             -19-\n\nFusco refused to  produce the parts and General  Motors moved\n\nto compel  production.  The  district court wrote  a ten-page\n\norder denying General Motors' motion.  \n\n     In its order, the court said that General Motors knew as\n\nearly as  May 1991 that  Fusco intended to offer  evidence of\n\nexamination  by scanning electron microscope.  The court also\n\nsaid that the new examination  was intended as the  predicate\n\nfor new expert testimony by General Motors, testimony unknown\n\nto Fusco when General Motors' experts  were deposed, and that\n\nthis last minute  addition imposed an unfair burden  on Fusco\n\non the eve of the second  trial.  The court also referred  to\n\nGeneral Motors' development of new evidence on the eve of the\n\nfirst trial,  which the court  had permitted over  protest by\n\nFusco.   Finally, it  expressed concern  that General  Motors\n\nsought  to overwhelm plaintiff  with its unlimited  legal and\n\nfinancial resources.\n\n     There is no doubt here of the district court's authority\n\nto deny further discovery.   As noted above, no automatic bar\n\nexists  against  new evidence  at  a  second  trial; but  the\n\ndiscovery deadline  had long  since passed  and the  district\n\ncourt had  no automatic  obligation to  reopen the  discovery\n\nperiod.

Fusco  after all\n\nwas  seeking  $8  million,  and  defense  counsel  apparently\n\nperceived in  the first trial  that the testimony  by Fusco's\n\nexpert about  the scanning  electron microscope  carried some\n\nweight.  But it was primarily  for the trial judge to balance\n\nthe  factors, such  as  the timing  of  the request,  General\n\nMotors'  earlier knowledge, the  possible burden on  Fusco of\n\npreparing to confront a new expert, and the importance of the\n\ntestimony.   The balance struck  here by the trial  judge was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -21-\n</pre>",
