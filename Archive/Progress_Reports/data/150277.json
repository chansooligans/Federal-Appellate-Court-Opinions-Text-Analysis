Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           BOUDIN,   Circuit   Judge.   Paula   O'Donnell,   a    former\n\nemployee of the Boston Globe Employees Credit Union (\"the Credit\n\nUnion\"), appeals from the dismissal on summary judgment of her\n\nMassachusetts state law claims alleging tortious interference with\n\ncontractual relations by her supervisor and others.              On this\n\nappeal, the central issue concerns preemption of state law claims\n\nunder Supreme Court precedent designed to protect the collective\n\nbargaining process governed by federal labor law.\n\n           O'Donnell began working at the Credit Union as a teller\n\nin 1974.   Her employment was governed by a collective bargaining\n\nagreement (\"CBA\") between the Credit Union and the Office and\n\nProfessional   Employees   International   Union,   Local   6,   AFL-CIO\n\n(\"Local 6\"), of which she was a member.         During the relevant\n\nperiod, defendant Marion Doucette was Manager/CEO of the Credit\n\nUnion and was also a member of its board of directors (\"the Board\")\n\nalong with Donna Boggs, Brendan Hall, William Francis, and Mary Lou\n\nMeighan.\n\n           According to O'Donnell, in 1998 as head teller she\n\nreported fraud and embezzlement by Gene Farrell, then Manager/CEO\n\nof the Credit Union, which \"engendered hostility and antagonism\n\nfrom certain Board members.\"    Farrell was replaced later that year\n\nby Doucette.   Within the next year or so, O'Donnell was promoted to\n\nbookkeeper and then systems manager, positions in which she had\n\nsome auditing and oversight functions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            In November 2000, Doucette hired her daughter Linda as\n\nbookkeeper.    O'Donnell complained to Doucette and the Board that\n\nLinda was not qualified and was being paid more than the CBA\n\nschedule provided.     O'Donnell says that then Doucette\n\n            began a course of retaliation, intimidation\n            and interference directed at Mrs. O'Donnell. .\n            . . [including] verbally harass[ing] and\n            intimidat[ing] Mrs. O'Donnell, obstruct[ing]\n            performance of her duties, and prevent[ing]\n            her from fully participating in managerial\n            tasks that would allow her to maintain or\n            advance her position in the Credit Union.\n\nOn    O'Donnell's   account,       Doucette's   behavior      toward   O'Donnell\n\nworsened when O'Donnell reported serious misconduct by Linda,1 who\n\nwas finally terminated in February 2003.\n\n            When the most serious charges of wrongdoing by Linda were\n\nreported to the state banking commission, O'Donnell claims Credit\n\nUnion Board members Francis and Boggs blamed her and \"hostile[ly]\n\nand    antagonistic[ally]      .    .   .   retaliated   by   obstructing    the\n\nperformance of her duties.\" O'Donnell discovered that she had been\n\nlocked out of a computer system and could no longer monitor Linda's\n\nstill-active Credit Union account; when she told the Board, Boggs\n\nsimply ordered her to clear certain checks submitted by Linda.                By\n\nAugust 2003, O'Donnell says Doucette had expanded her retaliatory\n\n\n\n       1\n      O'Donnell reported successively that Linda had bounced over\na hundred checks on her personal Credit Union account (which were\nprocessed at Doucette's direction despite insufficient funds and\nagainst Credit Union policy), deliberately overridden security\nprocedures on the accounting system to clear a personal check\ndespite insufficient funds, and manipulated the clearing account\nand falsified financial records to fraudulently obtain funds.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fand intimidating conduct, including \"daily verbal abuse, almost\n\nweekly acts of physical violence . . . and weekly interference with\n\nthe performance of Mrs. O'Donnell's duties,\" which \"resulted in\n\nboth   actual    physical,   emotional     and    professional      injury\"    to\n\nO'Donnell.\n\n              As a result, O'Donnell says that upon prudent medical\n\nadvice, she stopped working on August 15, 2003, citing stress-\n\nrelated reasons. In late November 2003, the Credit Union requested\n\nthat she provide a doctor's report, but she did not do so.                    She\n\nexhausted her sick leave and vacation time by December 2003, asked\n\nfor further leave, and was refused because the Board concluded that\n\nDoucette had not committed any wrongful conduct that would warrant\n\nO'Donnell's leave of absence and, additionally, because O'Donnell\n\nhad provided no medical evidence to show her need for the leave.\n\n              After a further warning that O'Donnell must return to\n\nwork or face termination, O'Donnell was terminated.             Local 6 filed\n\na grievance on her behalf, claiming unjust termination in violation\n\nof the CBA; but it eventually withdrew the grievance, stating that\n\nthe case lacked merit and that the Credit Union had not violated\n\nthe    CBA.      O'Donnell   then   charged      Local   6   with   inadequate\n\nrepresentation, but a regional director of the National Labor\n\nRelations Board dismissed the charge and O'Donnell's internal\n\nadministrative appeal failed.\n\n              In the meantime, in April 2005, O'Donnell filed a lawsuit\n\nin Massachusetts Superior Court, alleging two counts of tortious\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\finterference of contractual relations--one against her supervisor\n\nDoucette, and one against Board members Boggs, Hall, Francis, and\n\nMeighan.   The defendants removed the case to federal district\n\ncourt, arguing that section 301 of the Labor Management Relations\n\nAct (\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 185(a) (2006), preempted O'Donnell's\n\nstate law tort claims; and they thereafter moved for summary\n\njudgment on the same ground.\n\n           There followed a second complaint by O'Donnell in federal\n\ncourt, which added another claim and was consolidated with the\n\nfirst; the district court permitted O'Donnell to file an amended\n\ncomplaint in the consolidated case that added yet another claim;\n\nand magistrate judge recommendations were issued on the first\n\ncomplaint and the amended one.\n\n           In the end the district court agreed that the tortious\n\ninterference claims were preempted and their dismissal alone is\n\nchallenged by O'Donnell on this appeal. Several other claims made\n\nby O'Donnell were dismissed on other grounds but O'Donnell has not\n\nchallenged those dispositions.     The district court's preemption\n\nruling is primarily a legal issue subject to de novo review.\n\nSouthex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass'n, 279 F.3d 94, 98\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           On its face, section 301 merely confers federal court\n\njurisdiction over \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an\n\nemployer and a labor organization representing employees in an\n\nindustry affecting commerce,\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 185(a), but the Supreme\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fCourt has deemed such contracts creatures of federal law, whatever\n\nthe intent of the parties, Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353\n\nU.S. 448, 451 (1957); and the Court treats section 301 as a warrant\n\nboth for removing to federal court state law claims preempted by\n\nsection 301 and then dismissing them. Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.\n\nLueck, 471 U.S. 202, 220-21 (1985); Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No.\n\n735, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists, 390 U.S. 557, 559-60 (1968).\n\n           The    phrase    \"complete      preemption\"    is   often   used   in\n\ndescribing     this   state   of    affairs,      Beneficial   Nat'l   Bank   v.\n\nAnderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8 (2003), and it applies most readily to\n\nstate-law contract claims purporting to enforce CBAs covered by\n\nsection 301,     Local 174, Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95,\n\n101-03 & n.9 (1962).       But the doctrine extends beyond this point to\n\nother claims, including purported state law tort claims, whose\n\nenforcement interferes with federal labor law and policy.               Allis-\n\nChalmers, 471 U.S. at 210-13. 220.             \"Just how far beyond has never\n\nbeen precisely settled.\"       Martin v. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc., 105\n\nF.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Pertinent to the present appeal, the Supreme Court has\n\ndeclared that state law claims are preempted under section 301 if\n\nthey   \"require    construing      the    collective-bargaining    agreement\"\n\nbecause of the congressional interest in uniform interpretation of\n\ncollective bargaining agreements.              Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic\n\nChef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 407 (1988).              No Supreme Court decision\n\nhas addressed directly preemption of tortious interference claims\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\funder section 301, but many federal courts of appeals have done so,\n\nand a number including our own have found certain such claims\n\npreempted under section 301 where deciding them would require the\n\ncourt to interpret a CBA.2\n\n          Whether a given claim is completely preempted depends\n\nimportantly on the elements of that claim under state law and the\n\ncontent of the applicable CBA.   DeCoe v. Gen. Motors Corp., 32 F.3d\n\n212, 216-18 (6th Cir. 1994); Covenant Coal, 977 F.2d at 899.\n\nMassachusetts imposes liability for intentional interference with\n\ncontractual relations on two different bases: interference by the\n\ndefendant with a third party's performance of its contract with the\n\nplaintiff, and interference by the defendant with the plaintiff's\n\nperformance of its contractual obligations with the third party.\n\nShafir v. Steele, 727 N.E.2d 1140, 1143-44 (Mass. 2000).        See\n\ngenerally Restatement (Second) of Torts ยงยง 766, 766A (1979).\n\n          The elements of tortious interference with contractual\n\nrelations, common to both theories of the tort under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, are as follows:\n\n          [T]he plaintiff must prove that (1) he had a\n          contract with a third party; (2) the defendant\n\n\n     2\n      E.g., Magerer v. John Sexton & Co., 912 F.2d 525, 530-31 (1st\nCir. 1990); Steinbach v. Dillon Cos., 253 F.3d 538, 540-41 (10th\nCir. 2001); Oberkramer v. IBEW-NECA Serv. Ctr., Inc., 151 F.3d 752,\n756 (8th Cir. 1998); Int'l Union, United Mine Workers v. Covenant\nCoal Corp., 977 F.2d 895, 899 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Kimbro v.\nPepsico, Inc., 215 F.3d 723, 727 (7th Cir. 2000). Cf. Local 926,\nInt'l Union of Operating Eng'rs v. Jones, 460 U.S. 669 (1983)\n(considering preemption of such a claim under the National Labor\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 151 et seq.).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                 knowingly interfered with that contract [by\n                 inhibiting   the    third   party's   or   the\n                 plaintiff's performance thereof, depending on\n                 the theory]; (3) the defendant's interference,\n                 in addition to being intentional, was improper\n                 in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was\n                 harmed by the defendant's actions.\n\nHarrison v. NetCentric Corp., 744 N.E.2d 622, 632 (Mass. 2001).\n\n                 What is special about O'Donnell's claim in this case is\n\nthat       the   defendants   accused   of    interfering     with   O'Donnell's\n\ncontractual rights with her employer--her supervisor Doucette and\n\nseveral members of the Board--are agents of the employer itself.\n\nThe problems of separating unlawful interference from management's\n\nlawful control of its employees are obvious and Massachusetts law\n\nimposes special restrictions on tortious interference claims by\n\nemployees against agents of the employer.3\n\n                 Invoking both theories available under Massachusetts law,\n\nO'Donnell alleged in her complaint as amended that Doucette and the\n\nBoard members knowingly acted in such a manner as \"to induce the\n\nCredit Union to terminate [O'Donnell's] employment relationship\"\n\nand    \"to       cause   O'Donnell   injury   and   prevent    her   from   fully\n\nperforming her required duties for the Credit Union.\" She referred\n\n\n\n       3\n      If the contract is for employment and the defendant is the\nplaintiff's supervisor or a corporate official of her employer\nacting within the scope of his or her employment or corporate\nresponsibilities, the plaintiff must show \"actual malice,\"\nBlackstone v. Cashman, 860 N.E.2d 7, 13-14 (Mass. 2007), but\ngradations of motive under state law do not control the preemption\nissue in this case which involves the relationship of the claim to\nthe CBA.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fto both theories in her opposition to the defendant's final motion\n\nfor summary judgment.\n\n            O'Donnell's claim based on what she calls the \"second\n\ndistinct period of tortious interference\"--the Board's decision to\n\nterminate her employment--is clearly preempted.          No court or jury\n\ncould decide whether the Board's termination of O'Donnell was\n\nimproper without interpreting the CBA's terms, including articles\n\nXV and XX concerning leaves of absence and permissible discharges.4\n\nAs the Eighth Circuit explained in Holschen, 2010 WL 842089, at *4,\n\nany expectancy of employment interfered with \"cannot be contrary to\n\nthe terms of the contract on which the expectancy depends.\"\n\n            On appeal, O'Donnell claims the district court did not\n\nadequately separate out and examine the \"first discrete period\" of\n\nalleged tortious interference--namely, the claimed harassment and\n\nretaliation by Doucette (and perhaps on one or more occasions by\n\nindividual Board members) that led up to O'Donnell's August 15,\n\n2003, abandonment of work.      The parties dispute whether O'Donnell\n\npreserved   this   line   of   argument   in   the   district   court,   but\n\nO'Donnell did invoke such conduct as interference.         Anyway, claims\n\nbased on that first period are also preempted even if examined\n\nindependently.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      See Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530-31; Oberkramer, 151 F.3d at 756;\nCovenant Coal, 977 F.2d at 899; see also Holschen v. Int'l Union of\nPainters, No. 09-1122, 2010 WL 842089, at *4 (8th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                   -9-\n\f           O'Donnell's argument is that the actions of Doucette (and\n\nperhaps   other   Board   members)    were    sufficiently   hostile   and\n\ndisruptive that they made her unable to carry out her own duties,\n\ncaused her need for medical leave, and made it impossible for her\n\nto return to work in accordance with her contractual obligations\n\nafter her leave was exhausted.       This claim might fit the latter of\n\nthe two theories of tortious interference under Massachusetts law\n\nset forth above, subject to the further requirement under state law\n\nto show malice.   See note 3, above.\n\n           The question remains whether such a claim would require\n\ninterpreting the CBA, and the answer is not straightforward.           On\n\nthe one hand, O'Donnell has alleged as facts classic abusive\n\ntreatment by Doucette motivated purely by personal resentment for\n\nthe unmasking of misconduct by Doucette's daughter.              Hawaiian\n\nAirlines v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 261 (1994) (preemption not\n\ntriggered by \"purely factual questions . . . [that] do not require\n\na court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).         On the other hand, the claim\n\nasserted is that the conduct involved improper interference by a\n\nsupervisor and Board members with an employee's performance of her\n\nduties.   It is not easy to see how one could avoid considering the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\n\n           Specifically, recognizing that the gravamen of the claim\n\nis \"interference\" with the contract, Doucette and any Board member\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fmight be expected to defend various of the acts charged, to the\n\nextent their commission is admitted, as justified by supervisory\n\nand Board responsibilities authorized by the contract.           Reproofs\n\nthat O'Donnell regards as harassment would, from Doucette's point\n\nof   view,   be   the   censuring   of   an   overzealous   employee,   and\n\nrelevantly limiting O'Donnell's computer access might be defended\n\nas a proper response to O'Donnell's own prior behavior.\n\n             The CBA has a standard, broad management rights clause\n\nwhich reserves for the Credit Union \"all management rights, powers,\n\nauthority and functions\" and \"the sole and exclusive right to\n\nmanage its business in every respect and to take any other action\n\nwhich the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of its\n\nbusiness.\" This clause seemingly bears on Doucette's authority and\n\nthat of any Board member acting individually, and a number of\n\ncases, including one of our own, rely on such clauses as the basis\n\nfor complete preemption of employee claims of interference with\n\ncontractual relations.5\n\n             O'Donnell's claim cannot be resolved without deciding,\n\nat a minimum, whether Doucette's and the Board members' conduct\n\nconstituted--in the language of the management rights clause--\n\n\"action which the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of\n\n\n\n      5\n      Steinbach, 253 F.3d at 540-42 (finding a plaintiff's claim\nthat her supervisor's harassment interfered with her performance of\nher employment duties preempted because it required interpretation\nof a CBA's management rights clause); Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530-31;\ncf. Bartholomew v. AGL Res., Inc., 361 F.3d 1333, 1340 (11th Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fits business.\"    This is so even if Doucette (or, less plausibly,\n\nthe other defendants) had personal motives.             O'Donnell and the\n\ndefendants disagree about whether the clause encompasses that\n\nconduct; thus there is a \"real interpretive dispute\" implicating\n\nthe CBA.   Martin, 105 F.3d at 42.\n\n           The Supreme Court has carved out and protected from\n\ncomplete preemption certain types of claims which it has variously\n\ncharacterized; but the common denominator is that they depend on an\n\nobligation, usually rooted in public policy, that goes beyond the\n\ninterests of the individual claimant.6           So far as they concern\n\ninterference with contractual obligations, the tort claims in this\n\ncase are not of that character.        O'Donnell did make a different\n\nclaim based on a whistleblower statute, but it was dismissed on\n\nother grounds and that dismissal has not been appealed.\n\n           Finally, although not part of our analysis, we note that\n\nO'Donnell's wrongful discharge claim was the subject of a grievance\n\nby the union, which included its assertion that \"one of the root\n\ncauses   for   Paula's   absences    was   on   the   job   stress   from   a\n\nrelationship   between   Paula   and   Marion    Doucette.\"      The   union\n\nultimately decided the grievance lacked merit, but at least this is\n\n\n\n     6\n      Hawaiian Airlines, 512 U.S. at 260-63 (whistleblower\nprotection claims under federal and state law for reporting\naviation safety issues); Livadas v.

Houlding with whom Harvey Weiner and Peabody &amp; Arnold LLP were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, SOUTER,<sup>[*]</sup> Associate Justice, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Paula O'Donnell, a former employee of the Boston Globe Employees Credit Union (\"the Credit Union\"), appeals from the dismissal on summary judgment of her Massachusetts state law claims alleging tortious interference with contractual relations by her supervisor and others. On this appeal, the central issue concerns preemption of state law claims under Supreme Court precedent designed to protect the collective bargaining process governed by federal labor law.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell began working at the Credit Union as a teller in 1974. Her employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between the Credit Union and the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 6, AFL-CIO (\"Local 6\"), of which she was a member. During the relevant period, defendant Marion Doucette was Manager/CEO of the Credit Union and was also a member of its board of directors (\"the Board\") along with Donna Boggs, Brendan Hall, William Francis, and Mary Lou Meighan.</p>\n<p>According to O'Donnell, in 1998 as head teller she reported fraud and embezzlement by Gene Farrell, then Manager/CEO of the Credit Union, which \"engendered hostility and antagonism from certain Board members.\" Farrell was replaced later that year by Doucette. Within the next year or so, O'Donnell was promoted to bookkeeper and then systems manager, positions in which she had some auditing and oversight functions.</p>\n<p>In November 2000, Doucette hired her daughter Linda as bookkeeper. O'Donnell complained to Doucette and the Board that Linda was not qualified and was being paid more than the CBA schedule provided. O'Donnell says that then Doucette</p>\n<blockquote>began a course of retaliation, intimidation and interference directed at Mrs. O'Donnell. . . . [including] verbally harass[ing] and intimidat[ing] Mrs. O'Donnell, obstruct[ing] performance of her duties, and prevent[ing] her from fully participating in managerial tasks that would allow her to maintain or advance her position in the Credit Union.</blockquote>\n<p>On O'Donnell's account, Doucette's behavior toward O'Donnell worsened when O'Donnell reported serious misconduct by Linda,<sup>[1]</sup> who was finally terminated in February 2003.</p>\n<p>When the most serious charges of wrongdoing by Linda were reported to the state banking commission, O'Donnell claims Credit Union Board members Francis and Boggs blamed her and \"hostile[ly] and antagonistic[ally] . . . retaliated by obstructing the performance of her duties.\" O'Donnell discovered that she had been locked out of a computer system and could no longer monitor Linda's still-active Credit Union account; when she told the Board, Boggs simply ordered her to clear certain checks submitted by Linda. By August 2003, O'Donnell says Doucette had expanded her retaliatory and intimidating conduct, including \"daily verbal abuse, almost weekly acts of physical violence . . . and weekly interference with the performance of Mrs. O'Donnell's duties,\" which \"resulted in both actual physical, emotional and professional injury\" to O'Donnell.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> As a result, O'Donnell says that upon prudent medical advice, she stopped working on August 15, 2003, citing stress-related reasons. In late November 2003, the Credit Union requested that she provide a doctor's report, but she did not do so. She exhausted her sick leave and vacation time by December 2003, asked for further leave, and was refused because the Board concluded that Doucette had not committed any wrongful conduct that would warrant O'Donnell's leave of absence and, additionally, because O'Donnell had provided no medical evidence to show her need for the leave.</p>\n<p>After a further warning that O'Donnell must return to work or face termination, O'Donnell was terminated. Local 6 filed a grievance on her behalf, claiming unjust termination in violation of the CBA; but it eventually withdrew the grievance, stating that the case lacked merit and that the Credit Union had not violated the CBA. O'Donnell then charged Local 6 with inadequate representation, but a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board dismissed the charge and O'Donnell's internal administrative appeal failed.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, in April 2005, O'Donnell filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts Superior Court, alleging two counts of tortious interference of contractual relationsยone against her supervisor Doucette, and one against Board members Boggs, Hall, Francis, and Meighan. The defendants removed the case to federal district court, arguing that section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 185(a) (2006), preempted O'Donnell's state law tort claims; and they thereafter moved for summary judgment on the same ground.</p>\n<p>There followed a second complaint by O'Donnell in federal court, which added another claim and was consolidated with the first; the district court permitted O'Donnell to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case that added yet another claim; and magistrate judge recommendations were issued on the first complaint and the amended one.</p>\n<p>In the end the district court agreed that the tortious interference claims were preempted and their dismissal alone is challenged by O'Donnell on this appeal. Several other claims made by O'Donnell were dismissed on other grounds but O'Donnell has not challenged those dispositions. The district court's preemption ruling is primarily a legal issue subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass'n,</i> 279 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>On its face, section 301 merely confers federal court jurisdiction over \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce,\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 185(a), but the Supreme Court has deemed such contracts creatures of federal law, whatever the intent of the parties, <i>Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. 448, 451, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957); and the Court treats section 301 as a warrant both for removing to federal court state law claims preempted by section 301 and then dismissing them. <i>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,</i> 471 U.S. 202, 220-21, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985); <i>Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 390 U.S. 557, 559-60, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968).</p>\n<p>The phrase \"complete preemption\" is often used in describing this state of affairs, <i>Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson,</i> 539 U.S. 1, 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058, 156 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003), and it applies most readily to state-law contract claims purporting to enforce CBAs covered by section 301, <i>Local 174, Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co.,</i> 369 U.S. 95, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> 101-03 &amp; n. 9, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962). But the doctrine extends beyond this point to other claims, including purported state law tort claims, whose enforcement interferes with federal labor law and policy. <i>Allis-Chalmers,</i> 471 U.S. at 210-13, 105 S.Ct. 1904. 220. \"Just how far beyond has never been precisely settled.\" <i>Martin v. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>Pertinent to the present appeal, the Supreme Court has declared that state law claims are preempted under section 301 if they \"require construing the collective-bargaining agreement\" because of the congressional interest in uniform interpretation of collective bargaining agreements. <i>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,</i> 486 U.S. 399, 407, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988). No Supreme Court decision has addressed directly preemption of tortious interference claims under section 301, but many federal courts of appeals have done so, and a number including our own have found certain such claims preempted under section 301 where deciding them would require the court to interpret a CBA.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Whether a given claim is completely preempted depends importantly on the elements of that claim under state law and the content of the applicable CBA. <i>DeCoe v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 32 F.3d 212, 216-18 (6th Cir.1994); <i>Covenant Coal,</i> 977 F.2d at 899. Massachusetts imposes liability for intentional interference with contractual relations on two different bases: interference by the defendant with a <i>third party's performance</i> of its contract with the plaintiff, and interference by the defendant with the <i>plaintiff's performance</i> of its contractual obligations with the third party. <i>Shafir v. Steele,</i> 431 Mass. 365, 727 N.E.2d 1140, 1143-44 (2000). <i>See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> ยงยง 766, 766A (1979).</p>\n<p>The elements of tortious interference with contractual relations, common to both theories of the tort under Massachusetts law, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he plaintiff must prove that (1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly interfered with that contract [by inhibiting the third party's or the plaintiff's performance thereof, depending on the theory]; (3) the defendant's interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant's actions.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Harrison v. NetCentric Corp.,</i> 433 Mass. 465, 744 N.E.2d 622, 632 (2001).</p>\n<p>What is special about O'Donnell's claim in this case is that the defendants accused of interfering with O'Donnell's contractual rights with her employerยher supervisor Doucette and several members of the Boardยare <i>agents</i> of the employer itself. The problems of separating unlawful interference from management's lawful control of its employees are obvious and Massachusetts law imposes special restrictions on tortious interference claims by employees against agents of the employer.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> Invoking both theories available under Massachusetts law, O'Donnell alleged in her complaint as amended that Doucette and the Board members knowingly acted in such a manner as \"to induce the Credit Union to terminate [O'Donnell's] employment relationship\" <i>and</i> \"to cause O'Donnell injury and prevent her from fully performing her required duties for the Credit Union.\" She referred to both theories in her opposition to the defendant's final motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell's claim based on what she calls the \"second distinct period of tortious interference\"ยthe Board's decision to terminate her employmentยis clearly preempted. No court or jury could decide whether the Board's termination of O'Donnell was improper without interpreting the CBA's terms, including articles XV and XX concerning leaves of absence and permissible discharges.<sup>[4]</sup> As the Eighth Circuit explained in <i>Holschen,</i> 598 F.3d 454, 460, any expectancy of employment interfered with \"cannot be contrary to the terms of the contract on which the expectancy depends.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, O'Donnell claims the district court did not adequately separate out and examine the \"first discrete period\" of alleged tortious interferenceยnamely, the claimed harassment and retaliation by Doucette (and perhaps on one or more occasions by individual Board members) that led up to O'Donnell's August 15, 2003, abandonment of work. The parties dispute whether O'Donnell preserved this line of argument in the district court, but O'Donnell did invoke such conduct as interference. Anyway, claims based on that first period are also preempted even if examined independently.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell's argument is that the actions of Doucette (and perhaps other Board members) were sufficiently hostile and disruptive that they made her unable to carry out her own duties, caused her need for medical leave, and made it impossible for her to return to work in accordance with her contractual obligations after her leave was exhausted. This claim might fit the latter of the two theories of tortious interference under Massachusetts law set forth above, subject to the further requirement under state law to show malice. See note 3, above.</p>\n<p>The question remains whether such a claim would require interpreting the CBA, and the answer is not straightforward. On the one hand, O'Donnell has alleged <i>as facts</i> classic abusive treatment by Doucette motivated purely by personal resentment for the unmasking of misconduct by Doucette's daughter. <i>Hawaiian Airlines v. Norris,</i> 512 U.S. 246, 261, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 129 L.Ed.2d 203 (1994) (preemption not triggered by \"purely factual questions . . . [that] do not require a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). On the other hand, <i>the claim</i> asserted is that the conduct involved improper interference by a supervisor and Board members with an employee's performance of her duties. It is not easy to see how one could avoid considering the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Specifically, recognizing that the gravamen of the claim is \"interference\" with the contract, Doucette and any Board member <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> might be expected to defend various of the acts charged, to the extent their commission is admitted, as justified by supervisory and Board responsibilities authorized by the contract. Reproofs that O'Donnell regards as harassment would, from Doucette's point of view, be the censuring of an overzealous employee, and relevantly limiting O'Donnell's computer access might be defended as a proper response to O'Donnell's own prior behavior.</p>\n<p>The CBA has a standard, broad management rights clause which reserves for the Credit Union \"all management rights, powers, authority and functions\" and \"the sole and exclusive right to manage its business in every respect and to take any other action which the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of its business.\" This clause seemingly bears on Doucette's authority and that of any Board member acting individually, and a number of cases, including one of our own, rely on such clauses as the basis for complete preemption of employee claims of interference with contractual relations.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>O'Donnell's claim cannot be resolved without deciding, at a minimum, whether Doucette's and the Board members' conduct constitutedยin the language of the management rights clauseย\"action which the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of its business.\" This is so even if Doucette (or, less plausibly, the other defendants) had personal motives. O'Donnell and the defendants disagree about whether the clause encompasses that conduct; thus there is a \"real interpretive dispute\" implicating the CBA. <i>Martin,</i> 105 F.3d at 42.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has carved out and protected from complete preemption certain types of claims which it has variously characterized; but the common denominator is that they depend on an obligation, usually rooted in public policy, that goes beyond the interests of the individual claimant.<sup>[6]</sup> So far as they concern interference with contractual obligations, the tort claims in this case are not of that character. O'Donnell did make a different claim based on a whistleblower statute, but it was dismissed on other grounds and that dismissal has not been appealed.</p>\n<p>Finally, although not part of our analysis, we note that O'Donnell's wrongful discharge claim was the subject of a grievance by the union, which included its assertion that \"one of the root causes for Paula's absences was on the job stress from a relationship between Paula and Marion Doucette.\" The union ultimately decided the grievance lacked merit, but at least this is not the more troubling case in which there is a preempted claim without the availability of a remedy under the CBA.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  O'Donnell reported successively that Linda had bounced over a hundred checks on her personal Credit Union account (which were processed at Doucette's direction despite insufficient funds and against Credit Union policy), deliberately overridden security procedures on the accounting system to clear a personal check despite insufficient funds, and manipulated the clearing account and falsified financial records to fraudulently obtain funds.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>E.g., </i><i>Magerer v.

No Supreme Court decision has addressed directly preemption of tortious interference claims under section 301, but many federal courts of appeals have done so, and a number including our own have found certain such claims preempted under section 301 where deciding them would require the court to interpret a CBA.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Whether a given claim is completely preempted depends importantly on the elements of that claim under state law and the content of the applicable CBA. <i>DeCoe v.

Massachusetts imposes liability for intentional interference with contractual relations on two different bases: interference by the defendant with a <i>third party's performance</i> of its contract with the plaintiff, and interference by the defendant with the <i>plaintiff's performance</i> of its contractual obligations with the third party. <i>Shafir v.

The problems of separating unlawful interference from management's lawful control of its employees are obvious and Massachusetts law imposes special restrictions on tortious interference claims by employees against agents of the employer.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> Invoking both theories available under Massachusetts law, O'Donnell alleged in her complaint as amended that Doucette and the Board members knowingly acted in such a manner as \"to induce the Credit Union to terminate [O'Donnell's] employment relationship\" <i>and</i> \"to cause O'Donnell injury and prevent her from fully performing her required duties for the Credit Union.\" She referred to both theories in her opposition to the defendant's final motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell's claim based on what she calls the \"second distinct period of tortious interference\"ยthe Board's decision to terminate her employmentยis clearly preempted. No court or jury could decide whether the Board's termination of O'Donnell was improper without interpreting the CBA's terms, including articles XV and XX concerning leaves of absence and permissible discharges.<sup>[4]</sup> As the Eighth Circuit explained in <i>Holschen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"80\"><a href=\"/opinion/80/holschen-v-inter-union-of-painters-council-2/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 460, any expectancy of employment interfered with \"cannot be contrary to the terms of the contract on which the expectancy depends.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, O'Donnell claims the district court did not adequately separate out and examine the \"first discrete period\" of alleged tortious interferenceยnamely, the claimed harassment and retaliation by Doucette (and perhaps on one or more occasions by individual Board members) that led up to O'Donnell's August 15, 2003, abandonment of work. The parties dispute whether O'Donnell preserved this line of argument in the district court, but O'Donnell did invoke such conduct as interference. Anyway, claims based on that first period are also preempted even if examined independently.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell's argument is that the actions of Doucette (and perhaps other Board members) were sufficiently hostile and disruptive that they made her unable to carry out her own duties, caused her need for medical leave, and made it impossible for her to return to work in accordance with her contractual obligations after her leave was exhausted. This claim might fit the latter of the two theories of tortious interference under Massachusetts law set forth above, subject to the further requirement under state law to show malice. See note 3, above.</p>\n<p>The question remains whether such a claim would require interpreting the CBA, and the answer is not straightforward. On the one hand, O'Donnell has alleged <i>as facts</i> classic abusive treatment by Doucette motivated purely by personal resentment for the unmasking of misconduct by Doucette's daughter. <i>Hawaiian Airlines v. Norris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117857\"><a href=\"/opinion/117857/hawaiian-airlines-inc-v-norris/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 261, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117857\"><a href=\"/opinion/117857/hawaiian-airlines-inc-v-norris/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (1994) (preemption not triggered by \"purely factual questions . . . [that] do not require a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). On the other hand, <i>the claim</i> asserted is that the conduct involved improper interference by a supervisor and Board members with an employee's performance of her duties. It is not easy to see how one could avoid considering the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Specifically, recognizing that the gravamen of the claim is \"interference\" with the contract, Doucette and any Board member <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> might be expected to defend various of the acts charged, to the extent their commission is admitted, as justified by supervisory and Board responsibilities authorized by the contract. Reproofs that O'Donnell regards as harassment would, from Doucette's point of view, be the censuring of an overzealous employee, and relevantly limiting O'Donnell's computer access might be defended as a proper response to O'Donnell's own prior behavior.</p>\n<p>The CBA has a standard, broad management rights clause which reserves for the Credit Union \"all management rights, powers, authority and functions\" and \"the sole and exclusive right to manage its business in every respect and to take any other action which the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of its business.\" This clause seemingly bears on Doucette's authority and that of any Board member acting individually, and a number of cases, including one of our own, rely on such clauses as the basis for complete preemption of employee claims of interference with contractual relations.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>O'Donnell's claim cannot be resolved without deciding, at a minimum, whether Doucette's and the Board members' conduct constitutedยin the language of the management rights clauseย\"action which the Credit Union deems desirable to the conduct of its business.\" This is so even if Doucette (or, less plausibly, the other defendants) had personal motives. O'Donnell and the defendants disagree about whether the clause encompasses that conduct; thus there is a \"real interpretive dispute\" implicating the CBA. <i>Martin,</i> 105 F.3d at 42.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has carved out and protected from complete preemption certain types of claims which it has variously characterized; but the common denominator is that they depend on an obligation, usually rooted in public policy, that goes beyond the interests of the individual claimant.<sup>[6]</sup> So far as they concern interference with contractual obligations, the tort claims in this case are not of that character. O'Donnell did make a different claim based on a whistleblower statute, but it was dismissed on other grounds and that dismissal has not been appealed.</p>\n<p>Finally, although not part of our analysis, we note that O'Donnell's wrongful discharge claim was the subject of a grievance by the union, which included its assertion that \"one of the root causes for Paula's absences was on the job stress from a relationship between Paula and Marion Doucette.\" The union ultimately decided the grievance lacked merit, but at least this is not the more troubling case in which there is a preempted claim without the availability of a remedy under the CBA.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.
