After a bench trial,\n                                      \n\njudgment was  entered in favor  of plaintiffs, Gamma  Audio &amp;\n\nVideo,  Inc.,  Taing  Tao,  Meng  I. Ung  and  Cheng  K.  Ung\n\n(collectively \"Gamma\"), on their  claim that defendant,  Ean-\n\nChea, unlawfully  distributed two videotapes  containing four\n\nepisodes  of the  Cambodian language  version of Jade  Fox, a\n                                                          \n\npopular   Chinese  language  soap  opera.    In  addition  to\n\nobtaining a permanent injunction against Ean-Chea,  Gamma was\n\nawarded $2,500  in statutory  damages, as  well as  costs and\n\nattorney's fees.  Both parties appeal from various aspects of\n\nthe   final  judgment  entered  below  and  seek  to  recover\n\nappellate  attorney's fees.  We affirm  the district court on\n\nall  issues except  one;  we  reverse  the  district  court's\n\nfinding  that the four  episodes of  Jade Fox  constitute one\n                                             \n\n\"work\"  for purposes of computing statutory damages.  Because\n\nwe  hold  that  four  works  were infringed,  we  vacate  the\n\ndistrict  court's  judgment ordering  Ean-Chea  to pay  Gamma\n\n$2,500 for the infringement of  only one work, and remand for\n\na redetermination of damages.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Television Broadcasts Ltd. (\"TVB\") is a producer of\n\nChinese language television programs and videotapes of  those\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nprograms.  The two programs at issue are Jade Fox and Hunters\n                                                             \n\nPrey.   They consist, respectively, of twenty-four and twenty\n    \n\none-hour  episodes.  Both are Chinese language \"Kung Fu\"-type\n\nserials created by TVB in  Hong Kong and originally broadcast\n\nthere.   Although considerably more violent, the programs are\n\nof the  same genre as  American soap operas.   It  is unclear\n\nwhether  the  episodes  were originally  broadcast  daily  or\n\nweekly.  TVB holds a valid United States copyright in each of\n\nthe programs.\n\n          Through  a   series  of  four   recorded  licensing\n\nagreements,  Gamma  obtained  three  exclusive  rights   with\n\nrespect to TVB's  programs.  Gamma obtained the  right to dub\n\nTVB  videotapes  into  Cambodian,  to  duplicate  the  dubbed\n\nversions,  and to distribute by rental the Cambodian versions\n\nin  thirty-seven  states  including   Massachusetts.    Gamma\n\nassigned all copyrights in the dubbed works  to its licensor,\n\nTelefeature,  Inc.   At the  time this action  was commenced,\n\nneither Gamma nor  anyone else had registered  the copyrights\n\nin the derivative works created by Gamma.\n\n          Shortly thereafter, Gamma entered into an exclusive\n\nlicensing  agreement with  Taing Tao  and  his partners,  the\n\nother individual  plaintiffs.   The agreement  gave them  the\n\nexclusive  right to distribute, by rental  to the public, the\n\nCambodian language videotapes created by Gamma, in six states\n\nincluding  Massachusetts.   Ean-Chea  owns and  operates  two\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nvideo rental stores in Lowell, Massachusetts.  The stores are\n\nnamed Overseas Video and Overseas Video II.  Ean-Chea was the\n\nauthorized distributor  of  the Cambodian  versions of  TVB's\n\nprograms in Massachusetts for Gamma's predecessor.\n\n          On February  9,  1991,  Chea  Sokhoeun,  acting  on\n\nGamma's  behalf, went to Overseas Video and rented tapes four\n\nthrough  eleven of the  Cambodian Jade  Fox series.   Because\n                                           \n\neach  tape contained two  episodes, the rented  tapes covered\n\nepisodes seven through twenty-two.\n\n          On June 13, 1991 Gamma commenced this action in the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for   the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts.  The complaint contained six causes of action.\n\nGamma alleged  violations of  the Copyright  Act of  1976, 17\n\nU.S.C.    101, et seq.  (the \"Copyright Act\") and  the Lanham\n                     \n\nAct, 15 U.S.C.   1051 et seq.  It also alleged four state-law\n                            \n\nclaims:       unfair   competition,    conversion,   tortious\n\ninterference  with  advantageous  business  relations  and  a\n\nconstructive trust.  Gamma alleged that Ean-Chea was behind a\n\nmassive pirating scheme, and requested millions of dollars in\n\nrelief.\n\n          Together with the complaint,  Gamma submitted a one\n\npage document entitled \"Motion  For Seizure and Impoundment.\"\n\nBy this  motion, Gamma sought  an ex parte order  allowing it\n                                          \n\n\"to seize and impound any and all video tapes which are owned\n\nor  under  the  control  of  the  defendants  and  which  are\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nCambodian  language versions  of the  TVB programs,  produced\n\nunder the  authority of plaintiff  Gamma Audio &amp;  Video, Inc.\n\nincluding any and all such  videotapes on the premises of the\n\nrespective  stores  of  defendants.\"   Simultaneously,  Gamma\n\nmoved for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary\n\ninjunction   enjoining   Ean-Chea   from   further  acts   of\n\ninfringement    and    from   disposing    any    potentially\n\n\"incriminating\"  materials  such  as  business  records   and\n\nadvertising materials.  This motion also asked that Ean-Chea\n\n          deliver up ... to be impounded during the\n          pendency of  this action,  all copies  of\n          the Gamma TVB Programs and all negatives,\n          prints,  matrices,   master  tapes,   all\n          business  records  relating to  the  sale\n          and/or rental of video tapes of the Gamma\n          TVB  Programs,  and all  other  materials\n          including   video   recorders,  automatic\n          video  tape  rewinders,   and  television\n          monitors  (collectively \"machines\")  used\n          in the making  of such infringing  copies\n          and all advertising and materials used in\n          the promotion thereof.\n\nGamma was authorized to visit Ean-Chea's video stores, in the\n\ncompany  of  a  U.S.  Marshal  or Deputy  Sheriff,  \"for  the\n\npurposes  of  inspection,   inventorying,  and  photographing\n\nmaterials   alleged  to  infringe,\"  and  to  carry  out  the\n\nimpoundment.\n\n          District  Judge  Mazzone  granted  the  motion  for\n\nseizure and  impoundment and a  T.R.O. and  ordered Gamma  to\n\npost a  bond in  the amount  of $2,500.   On  June 24,  1991,\n\nDistrict  Judge Zobel, to  whom the case  was assigned, heard\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nargument on Gamma's  motion for a preliminary  injunction and\n\ngranted it.\n\n          In  the  meantime,  on  June  14,   the  individual\n\nplaintiffs and their attorneys, accompanied by a local deputy\n\nsheriff, went to Overseas Video  to carry out the seizure and\n\nimpoundment.   The  raid yielded  nine  videotapes containing\n\nepisodes three  through twenty  of Hunters  Prey, which  were\n                                                \n\nfound in  a cardboard  box behind  the  front counter,  three\n\nhigh-speed commercial videotape  duplicating machines, and  a\n\nnotebook  containing business records  of Overseas Video that\n\nreflected the shipment to Montreal of an unauthorized copy of\n\na program called Serpentine Romance.\n                                   \n\n          Six months  later, on  December 13, 1991,  Ean-Chea\n\nmoved  for an order compelling Gamma  to return the impounded\n\nvideo equipment and tapes.   On January 13, 1992, Judge Zobel\n\ngranted  the  motion,   to  which  no  opposition   had  been\n\nsubmitted.    On   January  17,  however,  Gamma   moved  for\n\nreconsideration;  and  on  February  26  Judge  Zobel granted\n\nGamma's motion for reconsideration and then denied Ean-Chea's\n\nmotion for return of the impounded material.\n\n          On  April 28, Gamma elected to recover statutory as\n\nopposed   to  actual  damages,  on  its  claim  of  copyright\n\ninfringement.  The  next day it voluntarily  dismissed counts\n\ntwo through six  of its complaint, leaving only the copyright\n\nclaim  to be tried.   By this  time, Gamma  realized that the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ncopyrights  in all  but four  episodes  of Jade  Fox, numbers\n                                                    \n\nthirteen  through  sixteen,  as  well  as  the  copyright  in\n\nSerpentine  Romance  had  not been  registered  prior  to the\n                   \n\ncommencement  of the lawsuit, and therefore could not support\n\nan  action  seeking   statutory  damages.     These  episodes\n\ntherefore  dropped out  of the  case, leaving  only  the four\n\nepisodes  of Jade Fox  and the  seized videotapes  of Hunters\n                                                             \n\nPrey, as subjects of this litigation.\n    \n\n          On May 11,  1992, at the close of  a four-day bench\n\ntrial, the trial  judge stated her findings of fact.  In sum,\n\nthe  court found that Gamma had established infringement with\n\nrespect to episodes thirteen through sixteen of Jade Fox, but\n                                                        \n\nhad failed to  carry its burden of  proving infringement with\n\nrespect to the seized Hunters Prey tapes.\n                                  \n\n          The court then requested  additional submissions by\n\ncounsel for both parties on  two issues.  First, whether Ean-\n\nChea's unauthorized distribution of the Cambodian  version of\n\nfour  episodes  of  Jade Fox  could  support  a judgment  for\n                            \n\nstatutory   damages.    Second,  whether  each  of  the  four\n\ninfringed  episodes entitled  Gamma to  a  separate award  of\n\nstatutory damages.  The court held that Ean-Chea had wilfully\n\ninfringed  upon Gamma's  exclusive  right  to distribute  the\n\nvideo images of  the Chinese language version of  Jade Fox in\n                                                          \n\nMassachusetts,  and  that   Gamma  could  therefore   recover\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nstatutory  damages.  It  then found that  Gamma could recover\n\nonly one award of statutory damages for the infringement.\n\n          Meanwhile,  on June 8, 1992, Ean-Chea had moved for\n\nthe  return  of  its  high-speed  duplicating  machines   and\n\nnotebook, and for payment of the $2,500 bond posted by Gamma.\n\nOn July 3  the court ordered that the  materials be returned,\n\nbut  declined to  order payment  of the  bond.1   On  July 15\n\nGamma  moved for  costs under  the  Copyright Act,  including\n\nattorney's  fees, and on  December 12, 1992,  Ean-Chea cross-\n\nmoved for attorney's fees.  \n\n          In an  opinion dated  April 2,  1993, the  district\n\ncourt  ruled upon  Gamma's motion  for  costs and  attorney's\n\nfees, and Ean-Chea's  cross-motion for attorney's fees.   The\n\ncourt  awarded Gamma its costs and  determined that Gamma, as\n\nthe   \"prevailing  party,\"  was  eligible  for  an  award  of\n\nattorney's fees.  It also found  that Gamma was entitled to a\n\nfee award  because Ean-Chea  was a  willful  infringer.   The\n\ncourt denied Ean-Chea's cross-motion for fees.  These appeals\n\nensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On  their  respective   appeals  each  party  makes\n\nseveral arguments.  Ean-Chea maintains that:  (1) as a matter\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  articles are still in Gamma's possession pursuant to\nan order of attachment.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nof law,  Gamma  could not  obtain  a judgment  for  statutory\n\ndamages  because  the copyrights  in  the  Cambodian language\n\nepisodes of Jade Fox were not registered; (2) Gamma  violated\n                    \n\nEan-Chea's rights guaranteed  by the Fourth Amendment  in its\n\nsearch of  the premises  of Overseas Video;  (3) there  was a\n\nlack  of statutory  authority  for  seizing  the  duplicating\n\nmachines  and notebook; and  (4) the district  court erred in\n\nfinding   Gamma  to  be  the  \"prevailing  party\"  under  the\n\nCopyright Act, and that  Ean-Chea was in fact  the prevailing\n\nparty.\n\n          On its  cross-appeal, Gamma contends  that: (1) the\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  finding  that  Ean-Chea  had  not\n\nunlawfully  copied  the  Hunters Prey  videotapes;    (2) the\n                                     \n\ndistrict court erred  in limiting Gamma to a  single award of\n\nstatutory  damages; and  (3) the  district  court abused  its\n\ndiscretion in determining Gamma's attorney's fees award.\n\n          We review the district court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error, and its conclusions of law de novo.

We disagree.\n\n          Although  a  derivative   work  may  be  separately\n\ncopyrighted,  that copyright does not affect the copyright in\n\nthe underlying work.  The statute provides that\n\n          [t]he copyright in  a ... derivative work\n          extends only to  the material contributed\n          by  the   author   of   such   work,   as\n          distinguished   from    the   preexisting\n          material employed in  the work, and  does\n          not imply  any  exclusive  right  in  the\n          preexisting material.

Thus  the copyright  in a\n\nderivative   work  only   protects   the  original   elements\n\ncontributed by  the author  of the  derivative work,  in this\n\ncase the Cambodian language soundtrack created by Gamma.  Any\n\nelements that the author of the derivative work borrowed from\n\nthe underlying work, such as  the video images in the Chinese\n\nlanguage  episodes of  Jade  Fox,  remain  protected  by  the\n                                \n\ncopyrights in the underlying work.   We are led inexorably to\n\nthe conclusion that Ean-Chea infringed upon copyrights in the\n\nunderlying works  by renting  out episodes  of the  Cambodian\n\nversion of Jade Fox which contained video images protected by\n                   \n\nthe registered copyrights in the Chinese version of Jade Fox.\n                                                            \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nNext   we  determine  whether  Gamma  may  recover  for  this\n\ninfringement.\n\n          Under the Copyright  Act, the copyright owner  of a\n\nderivative work  \"has a cause  of action for  infringement by\n\nreason of the substantial copying from the derivative work of\n\nmaterial which originally appeared  in the underlying  work.\"\n\n1 Nimmer   3.05, at 3-30.  This means that, if  the copyright\n        \n\nowner  in a  derivative  work is  the  exclusive licensee  of\n\ncertain  rights  in  the  underlying  work,  it  becomes  the\n\ncopyright owner  of the  underlying work for  the purpose  of\n\nexercising   those  rights.

Ean-Chea\n\nappears to argue that: (1)  in executing the orders signed by\n\nJudge  Mazzone, Gamma  violated  Ean-Chea's Fourth  Amendment\n\nright to  be free  from unreasonable  searches and  seizures;\n\n(2)    503(a)  of the  Copyright Act  does not  authorize the\n\nseizure of  videotape duplicating machines;   (3)    509 does\n\nnot authorize the  seizure of books  and records (i.e.,  Ean-\n                                                      \n\nChea's  notebook);  and  (4) although     509  authorizes the\n\nseizure of videotape  duplicating machines,  Gamma failed  to\n\nfollow the procedures set forth therein.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          Ean-Chea  has,  generously   speaking,  provided  a\n\nsuperficial briefing of the above issues, often dedicating no\n\nmore  then  three or  four  conclusory sentences  to  a topic\n\nbefore moving on.   For this and other reasons  we reject all\n\nof the above contentions.\n\n          First we  confront Ean-Chea's  constitutional claim\n\narising under the Fourth Amendment.   While there appears  to\n\nbe  some support  for the  substance of  this argument,   see\n                                                             \n\nParamount  Pictures  Corp. v.  Doe,  821 F.

While  we  recognize  that  Gamma\n                       \n\ndownscaled its case as the  litigation proceeded, in light of\n\nits victory vis- -vis the four  episodes of Jade Fox, we have\n                                                    \n\nlittle  trouble in  concluding  that  Gamma  succeeded  on  a\n\n\"significant  issue in  the  litigation.\"    See  Langton  v.\n                                                         \n\nJohnston, 928 F.2d  1206, 1226 (1st Cir.  1991) (significance\n        \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nmust be  viewed  in light  of  \"the scope  and  tenor of  the\n\nlitigation as a whole\").\n\n          Furthermore,  by virtue of  its success,  Gamma was\n\nawarded  $2,500  in  statutory  damages,  and  Ean-Chea   was\n\npermanently enjoined from further acts of infringement.  This\n\nrestriction  on Ean-Chea's  future  behavior  marks  a  clear\n\nchange  in the legal relationship between the parties enuring\n\nto  Gamma's  benefit.   In  addition,  the  monetary judgment\n\nrecovered by Gamma  on the merits  of its claim is  more than\n\nsufficient to qualify it as a \"prevailing party.\"  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nFarrar v.

In the first  place, the\n\nvoluntarily dismissed  claims were not  copyright claims  and\n\nthus not germane to the  determination of whether Gamma was a\n\n\"prevailing party\" under the Copyright Act.

See Domegan, 972 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 407  n.9.

To\n                                  \n\ncarry this burden a plaintiff must prove each of the elements\n\nof copyright infringement:   (1) ownership of  the copyright;\n\nand (2) copying by the defendant.  Id.  It is undisputed that\n                                      \n\nGamma  satisfied the  first  prong of  this  test, and  Gamma\n\nargues that it met the second through circumstantial evidence\n\npresented at trial. \n\n          We have recognized that, in a copyright action,\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\n          proof  by direct  evidence of  copying is\n          generally not  possible since  the actual\n          act  of copying  is  rarely witnessed  or\n          recorded.  Normally, there is no physical\n          proof of copying other than the offending\n          object  itself.    Copying  therefore  is\n          generally established by showing that the\n          defendant had  access to  the copyrighted\n          work   and   that   the   offending   and\n          copyrighted  articles are  \"substantially\n          similar.\"\n\nConcrete  Machinery  Co.,  843  F.2d  at  605.   \"Copying  is\n                        \n\ndemonstrated when  someone who  has access  to a  copyrighted\n\nwork uses material  substantially similar to the  copyrighted\n\nwork in a  manner which interferes with a  right protected by\n\n17 U.S.C.   106.\"   Ford Motor Co. v.

The court\n\nconcluded  that it had not.  The court found that \"[t]he only\n\ndirect evidence with  respect to Hunters Prey is  that at the\n                                             \n\ntime of the raid there were ... 10 or 11 tapes, in a box near\n\nthe  counter.\"     Viewing  this  evidence  along   with  the\n\ncircumstantial  evidence, which  consisted  primarily of  the\n\nfact  that videotape copy  machines were found  at Ean-Chea's\n\nstore,   the  district  court   found  that  either   of  two\n\nconclusions were possible:   either (1) appellant  had copied\n\ntapes of Hunters Prey and/or held them out for  distribution;\n                     \n\nor (2) the tapes belonged  to another store and some customer\n\nerroneously  returned them to Ean-Chea's store.  According to\n\nthe  district court,  the latter  \"is  an equally  believable\n\nversion on the basis of the evidence ....\"  Id.  \n                                               \n\n          Taken as  a whole the court found that the evidence\n\nwas ambiguous to the extent that it was \"not prepared to draw\n\nthe inference\"  that Gamma  wished it to  draw, namely,  that\n\nEan-Chea either copied or  distributed videotapes of  Hunters\n                                                             \n\nPrey.\n    \n\n          Although  the  evidence   could  have  supported  a\n\nfinding  of  infringement,  the  district  court  credited  a\n\nplausible, lawful explanation  for the presence of  the tapes\n\nat Ean-Chea's store.  It is established beyond cavil that the\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\ntrial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility\n\nof  witnesses, see  Wainwright  v.

Given the  restricted  nature  of  our review  of  the\n   \n\ndistrict  court's findings  of fact,  we cannot  say that  it\n\nclearly  erred  in finding  that  Gamma failed  to  carry its\n\nburden  of proving that Ean-Chea had either made unauthorized\n\ncopies or unauthorized rentals of videotapes of Hunters Prey.\n                                                            \n\n          Gamma argues that  it is entitled to four awards of\n\nstatutory  damages  for  Ean-Chea's willful  infringement  of\n\nepisodes  thirteen through  sixteen of  Jade Fox.   Under the\n                                                \n\nCopyright Act a party may  seek an award of statutory damages\n\n\"in lieu\"  of actual damages.   17 U.S.C.   504(c).   Section\n\n504(c) provides  for an award  of statutory damages  \"for all\n\ninfringements involved in the action, with respect to any one\n                                                             \n\nwork,\"  and further  provides  that  for  \"purposes  of  this\n    \n\nsubsection, all the parts of a compilation or derivative work\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nconstitute  one work.\"    17  U.S.C.     504(c)(1)  (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          The district  court gave  Gamma a  single award  of\n\nstatutory  damages.    Although Ean-Chea  was  found  to have\n\ninfringed  upon the copyrights  in four separate  episodes of\n\nJade Fox, the court found that these episodes constituted one\n        \n\n\"work\"  for purposes of  computing statutory damages.   Since\n\nthe   district   court's   findings  on   this   issue   were\n\nsubstantially influenced by  its choice of a  different legal\n\nstandard  than  we  apply, its  determination  on  this mixed\n\nquestion of  law and  fact is entitled  to less  deference on\n\nreview than would be  accorded a pure  finding of fact.

The  district  court  found   that  the\n\ninfringement  of  each  episode warranted  its  own  award of\n\nstatutory damages, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\n          The  eight  Twin  Peaks  episodes,  as  the  Second\n                                 \n\nCircuit explained, \"represent  a current television  genre in\n\nwhich  one  or  more  plots  continue  from  one  episode  to\n\nanother.\"   Id. at  1381.   In fact, Twin  Peaks carried  the\n                                                \n\npoint  of  the  basic  plot  -  who  killed  Laura  Palmer  -\n\nthroughout  its  first season.    On the  issue  of statutory\n\ndamages, the court stated:\n\n          The  author of  eight  scripts for  eight\n          television episodes is not limited to one\n          award of  statutory damages  just because\n          he or she can continue the plot line from\n          one  episode  to  the next  and  hold the\n          viewers'  interest  without  furnishing a\n          resolution.     We  might  well   have  a\n          different situation if  a book written as\n          a  single  work  was   then  adapted  for\n          television as  a group  of episodes,  for\n          example,    the    six-part    television\n          adaptations  of  John  LeCarre's \"Tinker,\n          Tailor,  Soldier,   Spy\"  and   \"Smiley's\n          People.\"    Even in  such  circumstances,\n          though  there  would  be   but  one  book\n          infringed, there might be separate awards\n          for   infringement   of   each  televised\n          episode. \n\nId.   The Second Circuit  found that Twin  Peaks was an  easy\n                                                \n\ncase,  and that  the eight  teleplays  or televised  episodes\n\nclearly constituted  eight separate  works.   While our  case\n\nstrongly  resembles Twin Peaks,  we pause here  to assay some\n                              \n\ndifferences.\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n          First, the copyrights  in episodes thirteen through\n\nsixteen of Jade Fox were  registered on a single registration\n                   \n\nform, while the eight episodes of Twin Peaks were \"separately\n                                            \n\ncopyrighted.\" Id.  Second, there was no evidence submitted as\n                 \n\nto  whether the scripts for episodes thirteen through sixteen\n\nof  Jade Fox  were  separately  written,  whereas  the  eight\n            \n\nepisodes of  Twin Peaks  were based  upon separately  written\n                       \n\nteleplays.

Although the  Twin Peaks court  did not  undertake the\n                               \n\ntask of  supplying a  definition,  one court  of appeals  has\n\nposited  that \"separate  copyrights  are not  distinct  works\n\nunless  they can  `live  their own  copyright  life.'\"   Walt\n                                                             \n\nDisney  Co. v.  Powell, 897  F.2d 565,  569 (D.C.  Cir. 1990)\n                      \n\n(quoting Stigwood  530 F.2d at 1105).7  The test set forth in\n                 \n\nWalt Disney  is a functional  one, with the focus  on whether\n           \n\neach expression (or in  our case, television episode)  has an\n\nindependent  economic value and  is, in itself,  viable.  See\n                                                             \n\nWalt Disney, 897  F.2d at 569;  see also 3 Nimmer   14.04[E],\n                                                 \n\nat 14-64. \n\n          The  district court's  determination that  all four\n\nepisodes  of Jade  Fox were  one  \"work\" for  the purpose  of\n                      \n\nstatutory damages was  based on two facts:   that Gamma sells\n\nor rents only  complete sets of the Jade Fox  series to video\n                                            \n\nstores, and the copyrights in the four episodes at issue were\n\nregistered on  one form.   The former fact, according  to the\n\ndistrict  court,  \"suggests  plaintiffs  view  the  Jade  Fox\n                                                             \n\nepisodes as  one work  for economic purposes  notwithstanding\n\n                    \n\n7.  Walt  Disney arose  under the  Copyright Act of  1976 and\n                \ninvolved the infringement of six copyrights, each  protecting\na distinct pose of either Mickey  or Minnie Mouse.  The court\nheld that  the defendant had  only infringed upon  two works,\nMickey  and  Minnie,  for  purposes  of  assessing  statutory\ndamages.   See Walt Disney, 897 F.2d at 570 (\"Mickey is still\n                          \nMickey whether he is smiling or frowning, running or walking,\nwaving his left hand or his right.\").\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nthe rental  by consumers of only a few  episodes at a time or\n\nits production  in separate  episodes[,]\"   while the  latter\n\nfact  \"indicates  [that]   TVB  [the  author  of   Jade  Fox]\n                                                            \n\nconsidered  at least these four episodes to be one work.\"  We\n\ndo not find the district court's reasoning compelling.\n\n          Starting with the district court's second point, we\n\nfind that  there is simply  no authority for drawing  such an\n\ninference.   Under regulations  promulgated by  the Copyright\n\nOffice, the copyrights in multiple works may be registered on\n\na single form, and thus  considered one work for the purposes\n                                                             \n\nof  registration, see 37 C.F.R.   202.3(b)(3)(A), while still\n                     \n\nqualifying as  separate  \"works\"  for  purposes  of  awarding\n\nstatutory damages.8   We are  unable to find any  language in\n\n                    \n\n8.  The regulation states in pertinent part:\n          For  the  purpose  of registration  on  a\n          single application and upon  payment of a\n          single  registration  fee,  the following\n          shall be considered  a single work:   (A)\n          In  the  case of  published  works:   All\n          copyrightable elements that are otherwise\n          copyrightable  as  self-contained  works,\n          that  are included  in a  single unit  of\n          publication, and  in which  the copyright\n          claimant is the same ....\n37 C.F.R.   202.3(b)(3)(A).  Although we question whether the\nfour episodes of Jade  Fox at issue here were \"included  in a\n                          \nsingle unit  of publication,\" since episodes thirteen through\nsixteen  of Jade  Fox are contained  on two  videotapes, this\n                     \ngoes to  the issue  of TVB's  compliance  with the  copyright\nregulations, not whether Gamma is entitled to multiple awards\nof  statutory  damages.   As  the  legislative  history to   \n504(c)(1)  makes clear, the number of copyright registrations\nis not  the unit of  reference for determining the  number of\nawards of statutory damages.  Moreover, we note that the Twin\n                                                             \nPeaks  court  did  not  rely   on  the  number  of  copyright\n     \nregistrations  in reaching its  result.  See  Twin Peaks, 996\n                                                        \n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\neither  the statute  or  the  corresponding regulations  that\n\nprecludes a copyright  owner from registering the  copyrights\n\nin multiple  works on a single registration  form while still\n\ncollecting an award of statutory damages for the infringement\n\nof each work's copyright.\n\n          With regard  to the  district court's first  point,\n\nthat  Gamma sells  or rents  only complete  Jade Fox  sets to\n                                                    \n\nvideo  stores, we  do not  find this  fact persuasive  in the\n\npresent inquiry.   A distributor's decision  to sell or  rent\n\ncomplete sets of a series to video stores in no way indicates\n\nthat each  episode in the  series is unable to  stand alone.9\n\nMore significant for  present purposes is  the fact that  (1)\n\nviewers who rent the tapes  from their local video stores may\n\nrent as few or as many tapes as they want, may view one, two,\n\nor twenty episodes  in a single sitting, and  may never watch\n\nor rent all of the episodes; and (2) each episode in the Jade\n                                                             \n\nFox series was separately produced.\n   \n\n                    \n\nF.2d at 1381.\n\n9.  If the distributor of the Rocky series of motion pictures\n                                   \nrequired video stores to purchase  all five of the movies, or\nalternatively, packaged the movies as a boxed set for resale,\nthe five movies would not  suddenly become one \"work\" for the\npurpose  of  damages.   See, e.g.,  Cormack v.  Sunshine Food\n                                                             \nStores,  Inc.,  675  F.  Supp.  374,  377  (E.D. Mich.  1987)\n             \n(written  tests  designed  to  detect honesty  and  emotional\nstatus, respectively in  the workplace are not one \"work\" for\nthe  purpose of  statutory  damages  just  because  they  are\npackaged and sold together).\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\n          While our case arguably falls somewhere between the\n\nTwin Peaks and the hypothetical novel turned television mini-\n          \n\nseries scenario presented therein, 996 F.2d at 1381, it  more\n\nclosely resembles  Twin Peaks  than the  hypothetical.   Each\n                             \n\nepisode of Jade Fox was produced independently from the other\n                   \n\nepisodes,  and  each   episode  of  Jade  Fox  was  aired  on\n                                             \n\ntelevision  independently from  the preceding  and subsequent\n\nepisodes.10    In  addition,   unlike  the  \"Tinker,  Tailor,\n\nSoldier, Spy\" hypothetical in  Twin Peaks, our case  does not\n                                         \n\ninvolve the infringement  of a single book, but  rather, much\n\nlike   Twin  Peaks,   involves   the  infringement   of  four\n                  \n\nseparately-produced television episodes prepared as part of a\n\nweekly (or perhaps daily) series.   We conclude that Gamma is\n\nentitled to four  awards of statutory damages  for Ean-Chea's\n\ninfringement of four separate \"works.\" \n\n          As its final  argument on  its cross-appeal,  Gamma\n\ncontests the  district court's attorney's fee award.  The fee\n\napplication requested a total of $80,198.62  and costs in the\n\namount of $7,608.87.   The district court awarded  all of the\n\nrequested  costs,  but  substantially  reduced  Gamma's   fee\n\nrequest,  awarding $12,500.   This reduction  was based  on a\n\nmultitude of factors.\n\n                    \n\n10.  Because  no English  translation  of  the  episodes  was\nprovided below,  the district court  was unable to  study the\nepisodes' plots to gauge their relation to each other.\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\n          Generally speaking,  the district court  found that\n\nGamma had  \"over-prosecuted this  case, pursued  infringement\n\nactions on works that were not registered, and achieved  very\n\nlimited  success.\"  More  specifically, the court  found that\n\nplaintiffs  had  originally  \"filed  a  six-count   complaint\n\nalleging a massive scheme of wrongdoing, ... seeking millions\n\nof dollars in damages,\" and then, armed with a court order,\n\n          raided  Ean-Chea's  store  ... apparently\n          expecting  to  uncover  a huge  cache  of\n          infringing materials.  Instead, what they\n          found  was   a  single  set   of  pirated\n          `Hunters Prey'  tapes located  under some\n          trash in a cardboard  box by the counter,\n          some high speed  video copying equipment,\n          and a business  record that reflected the\n          shipment of  one unauthorized  copy of  a\n          program entitled `Serpentine  Romance' to\n          Montreal.\n\nThe   court  further  noted  that,  as  trial  neared,  Gamma\n\ndismissed the  five non-copyright claims, \"and  conceded that\n\nbecause  [the  copyrights in]  Serpentine Romance  and twelve\n\nepisodes of  Jade Fox  had not been  registered prior  to the\n                     \n\nfiling of the lawsuit, they too fell out of the case.\"\n\n          With  respect to Gamma's fee request, the court had\n\nmuch to say:\n\n          many  of  the [time-sheet]  entries  were\n          extremely  vague,  making   it  virtually\n          impossible  ...   to  determine   whether\n          requested hours were excessive, redundant\n          (especially with respect to how New  York\n          and  local  counsel  divided  tasks),  or\n          otherwise  unnecessary,  as  well  as  to\n          parse  out  attorney  time  and  expenses\n          related  to the  unsuccessful claims  and\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\n          [voluntarily]  dismissed  portion  of the\n          case.\n\nThe district court  then pointed out numerous  ambiguities in\n\nthe  attorneys' records, as well as instances where telephone\n\nconversations  between counsel  were  reflected  only in  the\n\nrecords  of one  of the  two  attorneys.   Finally the  court\n\nprovided   examples  of   charges   that  appeared   facially\n\nexcessive, such as billing the client for leaving a telephone\n\nmessage when  the person  telephoned was  absent.   The court\n\nsettled  on  a   fee  award  that  it   believed  represented\n\nreasonable compensation for the nature of the work performed,\n\ntaking into account how much time was actually expended.\n\n          The  district  court  found  that  the   time-sheet\n\nentries submitted  by  Gamma's attorney's  were so  ambiguous\n\nthat  it was  not clear  which  claims in  the complaint  the\n\nentries related  to.  For  example, the district  court noted\n\nentries that stated merely \"Draft documents,\" \"Work on Case,\"\n\n\"Review of  Discovery,\" and  \"study file,  legal research  re\n\nMass. case.\"\n\n          We review fee  awards for abuse of  discretion, see\n                                                             \n\nFoley  v.

Finding no\n\nabuse, we affirm the district court's fee award.\n\n          Each party contends that, under 17 U.S.C.   505, it\n\nis  entitled to recover its costs, including attorney's fees,\n\nincurred on this appeal.  In addition, Gamma seeks sanctions,\n\nin the  form of attorney's  fees, under  Fed. R. App.  P. 38.\n\nRule 38 allows for fees and double  costs to be awarded to an\n\nappellee  where the appellant has brought a frivolous appeal.\n\nWhile Ean-Chea did not prevail on his  appeal, we do not feel\n\nthat this  case warrants  the imposition  of sanctions  under\n\nRule 38.\n\n          While  it is true that, under    505, the Copyright\n\nAct, this court may  make an award of attorney's  fees to the\n\nprevailing  party for services  rendered on appeal,  see Twin\n                                                             \n\nPeaks, 996 F.2d  at 1383;  see  also 3 Nimmer    14.10[E], at\n                                             \n\n14-129 (\"An award of attorney's fees may be made for services\n\nrendered  on appeal  as  well  as at  the  trial level\"),  we\n\ndecline to do so.  Because  he did not prevail on his  appeal\n\nor the cross-appeal, Ean-Chea is  not entitled to an award of\n\nfees.  The appeal, however, was not frivolous, and Gamma only\n\nachieved  limited success on its cross-appeal.  Therefore, in\n\nthe  exercise of  our discretion  we decline  to  award Gamma\n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\nappellate fees.

After a bench trial,\n                                      \n\njudgment was  entered in favor  of plaintiffs, Gamma  Audio &amp;\n\nVideo,  Inc.,  Taing  Tao,  Meng  I. Ung  and  Cheng  K.  Ung\n\n(collectively \"Gamma\"), on their  claim that defendant,  Ean-\n\nChea, unlawfully  distributed two videotapes  containing four\n\nepisodes  of the  Cambodian language  version of Jade  Fox, a\n                                                          \n\npopular   Chinese  language  soap  opera.    In  addition  to\n\nobtaining a permanent injunction against Ean-Chea,  Gamma was\n\nawarded $2,500  in statutory  damages, as  well as  costs and\n\nattorney's fees.  Both parties appeal from various aspects of\n\nthe   final  judgment  entered  below  and  seek  to  recover\n\nappellate  attorney's fees.  We affirm  the district court on\n\nall  issues except  one;  we  reverse  the  district  court's\n\nfinding  that the four  episodes of  Jade Fox  constitute one\n                                             \n\n\"work\"  for purposes of computing statutory damages.  Because\n\nwe  hold  that  four  works  were infringed,  we  vacate  the\n\ndistrict  court's  judgment ordering  Ean-Chea  to pay  Gamma\n\n$2,500 for the infringement of  only one work, and remand for\n\na redetermination of damages.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Television Broadcasts Ltd. (\"TVB\") is a producer of\n\nChinese language television programs and videotapes of  those\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nprograms.  The two programs at issue are Jade Fox and Hunters\n                                                             \n\nPrey.   They consist, respectively, of twenty-four and twenty\n    \n\none-hour  episodes.  Both are Chinese language \"Kung Fu\"-type\n\nserials created by TVB in  Hong Kong and originally broadcast\n\nthere.   Although considerably more violent, the programs are\n\nof the  same genre as  American soap operas.   It  is unclear\n\nwhether  the  episodes  were originally  broadcast  daily  or\n\nweekly.  TVB holds a valid United States copyright in each of\n\nthe programs.\n\n          Through  a   series  of  four   recorded  licensing\n\nagreements,  Gamma  obtained  three  exclusive  rights   with\n\nrespect to TVB's  programs.  Gamma obtained the  right to dub\n\nTVB  videotapes  into  Cambodian,  to  duplicate  the  dubbed\n\nversions,  and to distribute by rental the Cambodian versions\n\nin  thirty-seven  states  including   Massachusetts.    Gamma\n\nassigned all copyrights in the dubbed works  to its licensor,\n\nTelefeature,  Inc.   At the  time this action  was commenced,\n\nneither Gamma nor  anyone else had registered  the copyrights\n\nin the derivative works created by Gamma.\n\n          Shortly thereafter, Gamma entered into an exclusive\n\nlicensing  agreement with  Taing Tao  and  his partners,  the\n\nother individual  plaintiffs.   The agreement  gave them  the\n\nexclusive  right to distribute, by rental  to the public, the\n\nCambodian language videotapes created by Gamma, in six states\n\nincluding  Massachusetts.   Ean-Chea  owns and  operates  two\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nvideo rental stores in Lowell, Massachusetts.  The stores are\n\nnamed Overseas Video and Overseas Video II.  Ean-Chea was the\n\nauthorized distributor  of  the Cambodian  versions of  TVB's\n\nprograms in Massachusetts for Gamma's predecessor.\n\n          On February  9,  1991,  Chea  Sokhoeun,  acting  on\n\nGamma's  behalf, went to Overseas Video and rented tapes four\n\nthrough  eleven of the  Cambodian Jade  Fox series.   Because\n                                           \n\neach  tape contained two  episodes, the rented  tapes covered\n\nepisodes seven through twenty-two.\n\n          On June 13, 1991 Gamma commenced this action in the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for   the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts.  The complaint contained six causes of action.\n\nGamma alleged  violations of  the Copyright  Act of  1976, 17\n\nU.S.C.    101, et seq.  (the \"Copyright Act\") and  the Lanham\n                     \n\nAct, 15 U.S.C.   1051 et seq.  It also alleged four state-law\n                            \n\nclaims:       unfair   competition,    conversion,   tortious\n\ninterference  with  advantageous  business  relations  and  a\n\nconstructive trust.  Gamma alleged that Ean-Chea was behind a\n\nmassive pirating scheme, and requested millions of dollars in\n\nrelief.\n\n          Together with the complaint,  Gamma submitted a one\n\npage document entitled \"Motion  For Seizure and Impoundment.\"\n\nBy this  motion, Gamma sought  an ex parte order  allowing it\n                                          \n\n\"to seize and impound any and all video tapes which are owned\n\nor  under  the  control  of  the  defendants  and  which  are\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nCambodian  language versions  of the  TVB programs,  produced\n\nunder the  authority of plaintiff  Gamma Audio &amp;  Video, Inc.\n\nincluding any and all such  videotapes on the premises of the\n\nrespective  stores  of  defendants.\"   Simultaneously,  Gamma\n\nmoved for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary\n\ninjunction   enjoining   Ean-Chea   from   further  acts   of\n\ninfringement    and    from   disposing    any    potentially\n\n\"incriminating\"  materials  such  as  business  records   and\n\nadvertising materials.  This motion also asked that Ean-Chea\n\n          deliver up ... to be impounded during the\n          pendency of  this action,  all copies  of\n          the Gamma TVB Programs and all negatives,\n          prints,  matrices,   master  tapes,   all\n          business  records  relating to  the  sale\n          and/or rental of video tapes of the Gamma\n          TVB  Programs,  and all  other  materials\n          including   video   recorders,  automatic\n          video  tape  rewinders,   and  television\n          monitors  (collectively \"machines\")  used\n          in the making  of such infringing  copies\n          and all advertising and materials used in\n          the promotion thereof.\n\nGamma was authorized to visit Ean-Chea's video stores, in the\n\ncompany  of  a  U.S.  Marshal  or Deputy  Sheriff,  \"for  the\n\npurposes  of  inspection,   inventorying,  and  photographing\n\nmaterials   alleged  to  infringe,\"  and  to  carry  out  the\n\nimpoundment.\n\n          District  Judge  Mazzone  granted  the  motion  for\n\nseizure and  impoundment and a  T.R.O. and  ordered Gamma  to\n\npost a  bond in  the amount  of $2,500.   On  June 24,  1991,\n\nDistrict  Judge Zobel, to  whom the case  was assigned, heard\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nargument on Gamma's  motion for a preliminary  injunction and\n\ngranted it.\n\n          In  the  meantime,  on  June  14,   the  individual\n\nplaintiffs and their attorneys, accompanied by a local deputy\n\nsheriff, went to Overseas Video  to carry out the seizure and\n\nimpoundment.   The  raid yielded  nine  videotapes containing\n\nepisodes three  through twenty  of Hunters  Prey, which  were\n                                                \n\nfound in  a cardboard  box behind  the  front counter,  three\n\nhigh-speed commercial videotape  duplicating machines, and  a\n\nnotebook  containing business records  of Overseas Video that\n\nreflected the shipment to Montreal of an unauthorized copy of\n\na program called Serpentine Romance.\n                                   \n\n          Six months  later, on  December 13, 1991,  Ean-Chea\n\nmoved  for an order compelling Gamma  to return the impounded\n\nvideo equipment and tapes.   On January 13, 1992, Judge Zobel\n\ngranted  the  motion,   to  which  no  opposition   had  been\n\nsubmitted.    On   January  17,  however,  Gamma   moved  for\n\nreconsideration;  and  on  February  26  Judge  Zobel granted\n\nGamma's motion for reconsideration and then denied Ean-Chea's\n\nmotion for return of the impounded material.\n\n          On  April 28, Gamma elected to recover statutory as\n\nopposed   to  actual  damages,  on  its  claim  of  copyright\n\ninfringement.  The  next day it voluntarily  dismissed counts\n\ntwo through six  of its complaint, leaving only the copyright\n\nclaim  to be tried.   By this  time, Gamma  realized that the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ncopyrights  in all  but four  episodes  of Jade  Fox, numbers\n                                                    \n\nthirteen  through  sixteen,  as  well  as  the  copyright  in\n\nSerpentine  Romance  had  not been  registered  prior  to the\n                   \n\ncommencement  of the lawsuit, and therefore could not support\n\nan  action  seeking   statutory  damages.     These  episodes\n\ntherefore  dropped out  of the  case, leaving  only  the four\n\nepisodes  of Jade Fox  and the  seized videotapes  of Hunters\n                                                             \n\nPrey, as subjects of this litigation.\n    \n\n          On May 11,  1992, at the close of  a four-day bench\n\ntrial, the trial  judge stated her findings of fact.  In sum,\n\nthe  court found that Gamma had established infringement with\n\nrespect to episodes thirteen through sixteen of Jade Fox, but\n                                                        \n\nhad failed to  carry its burden of  proving infringement with\n\nrespect to the seized Hunters Prey tapes.\n                                  \n\n          The court then requested  additional submissions by\n\ncounsel for both parties on  two issues.  First, whether Ean-\n\nChea's unauthorized distribution of the Cambodian  version of\n\nfour  episodes  of  Jade Fox  could  support  a judgment  for\n                            \n\nstatutory   damages.    Second,  whether  each  of  the  four\n\ninfringed  episodes entitled  Gamma to  a  separate award  of\n\nstatutory damages.  The court held that Ean-Chea had wilfully\n\ninfringed  upon Gamma's  exclusive  right  to distribute  the\n\nvideo images of  the Chinese language version of  Jade Fox in\n                                                          \n\nMassachusetts,  and  that   Gamma  could  therefore   recover\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nstatutory  damages.  It  then found that  Gamma could recover\n\nonly one award of statutory damages for the infringement.\n\n          Meanwhile,  on June 8, 1992, Ean-Chea had moved for\n\nthe  return  of  its  high-speed  duplicating  machines   and\n\nnotebook, and for payment of the $2,500 bond posted by Gamma.\n\nOn July 3  the court ordered that the  materials be returned,\n\nbut  declined to  order payment  of the  bond.1   On  July 15\n\nGamma  moved for  costs under  the  Copyright Act,  including\n\nattorney's  fees, and on  December 12, 1992,  Ean-Chea cross-\n\nmoved for attorney's fees.  \n\n          In an  opinion dated  April 2,  1993, the  district\n\ncourt  ruled upon  Gamma's motion  for  costs and  attorney's\n\nfees, and Ean-Chea's  cross-motion for attorney's fees.   The\n\ncourt  awarded Gamma its costs and  determined that Gamma, as\n\nthe   \"prevailing  party,\"  was  eligible  for  an  award  of\n\nattorney's fees.  It also found  that Gamma was entitled to a\n\nfee award  because Ean-Chea  was a  willful  infringer.   The\n\ncourt denied Ean-Chea's cross-motion for fees.  These appeals\n\nensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On  their  respective   appeals  each  party  makes\n\nseveral arguments.  Ean-Chea maintains that:  (1) as a matter\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  articles are still in Gamma's possession pursuant to\nan order of attachment.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nof law,  Gamma  could not  obtain  a judgment  for  statutory\n\ndamages  because  the copyrights  in  the  Cambodian language\n\nepisodes of Jade Fox were not registered; (2) Gamma  violated\n                    \n\nEan-Chea's rights guaranteed  by the Fourth Amendment  in its\n\nsearch of  the premises  of Overseas Video;  (3) there  was a\n\nlack  of statutory  authority  for  seizing  the  duplicating\n\nmachines  and notebook; and  (4) the district  court erred in\n\nfinding   Gamma  to  be  the  \"prevailing  party\"  under  the\n\nCopyright Act, and that  Ean-Chea was in fact  the prevailing\n\nparty.\n\n          On its  cross-appeal, Gamma contends  that: (1) the\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  finding  that  Ean-Chea  had  not\n\nunlawfully  copied  the  Hunters Prey  videotapes;    (2) the\n                                     \n\ndistrict court erred  in limiting Gamma to a  single award of\n\nstatutory  damages; and  (3) the  district  court abused  its\n\ndiscretion in determining Gamma's attorney's fees award.\n\n          We review the district court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error, and its conclusions of law de novo.

Accordingly,\n\nGamma  cannot recover statutory  damages, the only  remedy it\n\nsought,  for the infringement of its exclusive rights arising\n\nunder  these  unregistered copyrights.3   Instead,  Gamma may\n\nonly  recover statutory  damages  if Ean-Chea's  unauthorized\n\nrental  of the Jade  Fox videotapes infringed  upon exclusive\n                        \n\nrights held by Gamma pursuant to the registered copyrights in\n\nthe underlying works.  \n\n                    \n\n3.

We disagree.\n\n          Although  a  derivative   work  may  be  separately\n\ncopyrighted,  that copyright does not affect the copyright in\n\nthe underlying work.  The statute provides that\n\n          [t]he copyright in  a ... derivative work\n          extends only to  the material contributed\n          by  the   author   of   such   work,   as\n          distinguished   from    the   preexisting\n          material employed in  the work, and  does\n          not imply  any  exclusive  right  in  the\n          preexisting material.

Thus  the copyright  in a\n\nderivative   work  only   protects   the  original   elements\n\ncontributed by  the author  of the  derivative work,  in this\n\ncase the Cambodian language soundtrack created by Gamma.  Any\n\nelements that the author of the derivative work borrowed from\n\nthe underlying work, such as  the video images in the Chinese\n\nlanguage  episodes of  Jade  Fox,  remain  protected  by  the\n                                \n\ncopyrights in the underlying work.   We are led inexorably to\n\nthe conclusion that Ean-Chea infringed upon copyrights in the\n\nunderlying works  by renting  out episodes  of the  Cambodian\n\nversion of Jade Fox which contained video images protected by\n                   \n\nthe registered copyrights in the Chinese version of Jade Fox.\n                                                            \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nNext   we  determine  whether  Gamma  may  recover  for  this\n\ninfringement.\n\n          Under the Copyright  Act, the copyright owner  of a\n\nderivative work  \"has a cause  of action for  infringement by\n\nreason of the substantial copying from the derivative work of\n\nmaterial which originally appeared  in the underlying  work.\"\n\n1 Nimmer   3.05, at 3-30.  This means that, if  the copyright\n        \n\nowner  in a  derivative  work is  the  exclusive licensee  of\n\ncertain  rights  in  the  underlying  work,  it  becomes  the\n\ncopyright owner  of the  underlying work for  the purpose  of\n\nexercising   those  rights.

The Second Circuit  found that Twin  Peaks was an  easy\n                                                \n\ncase,  and that  the eight  teleplays  or televised  episodes\n\nclearly constituted  eight separate  works.   While our  case\n\nstrongly  resembles Twin Peaks,  we pause here  to assay some\n                              \n\ndifferences.\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n          First, the copyrights  in episodes thirteen through\n\nsixteen of Jade Fox were  registered on a single registration\n                   \n\nform, while the eight episodes of Twin Peaks were \"separately\n                                            \n\ncopyrighted.\" Id.  Second, there was no evidence submitted as\n                 \n\nto  whether the scripts for episodes thirteen through sixteen\n\nof  Jade Fox  were  separately  written,  whereas  the  eight\n            \n\nepisodes of  Twin Peaks  were based  upon separately  written\n                       \n\nteleplays.  Id.\n               \n\n          We take a step  back, at this juncture,  to discuss\n\nsome  background concerning  statutory  damages in  copyright\n\nactions.

See\n                                                             \n\nWalt Disney, 897  F.2d at 569;  see also 3 Nimmer   14.04[E],\n                                                 \n\nat 14-64. \n\n          The  district court's  determination that  all four\n\nepisodes  of Jade  Fox were  one  \"work\" for  the purpose  of\n                      \n\nstatutory damages was  based on two facts:   that Gamma sells\n\nor rents only  complete sets of the Jade Fox  series to video\n                                            \n\nstores, and the copyrights in the four episodes at issue were\n\nregistered on  one form.   The former fact, according  to the\n\ndistrict  court,  \"suggests  plaintiffs  view  the  Jade  Fox\n                                                             \n\nepisodes as  one work  for economic purposes  notwithstanding\n\n                    \n\n7.  Walt  Disney arose  under the  Copyright Act of  1976 and\n                \ninvolved the infringement of six copyrights, each  protecting\na distinct pose of either Mickey  or Minnie Mouse.  The court\nheld that  the defendant had  only infringed upon  two works,\nMickey  and  Minnie,  for  purposes  of  assessing  statutory\ndamages.   See Walt Disney, 897 F.2d at 570 (\"Mickey is still\n                          \nMickey whether he is smiling or frowning, running or walking,\nwaving his left hand or his right.\").\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nthe rental  by consumers of only a few  episodes at a time or\n\nits production  in separate  episodes[,]\"   while the  latter\n\nfact  \"indicates  [that]   TVB  [the  author  of   Jade  Fox]\n                                                            \n\nconsidered  at least these four episodes to be one work.\"  We\n\ndo not find the district court's reasoning compelling.\n\n          Starting with the district court's second point, we\n\nfind that  there is simply  no authority for drawing  such an\n\ninference.   Under regulations  promulgated by  the Copyright\n\nOffice, the copyrights in multiple works may be registered on\n\na single form, and thus  considered one work for the purposes\n                                                             \n\nof  registration, see 37 C.F.R.   202.3(b)(3)(A), while still\n                     \n\nqualifying as  separate  \"works\"  for  purposes  of  awarding\n\nstatutory damages.8   We are  unable to find any  language in\n\n                    \n\n8.  The regulation states in pertinent part:\n          For  the  purpose  of registration  on  a\n          single application and upon  payment of a\n          single  registration  fee,  the following\n          shall be considered  a single work:   (A)\n          In  the  case of  published  works:   All\n          copyrightable elements that are otherwise\n          copyrightable  as  self-contained  works,\n          that  are included  in a  single unit  of\n          publication, and  in which  the copyright\n          claimant is the same ....\n37 C.F.R.   202.3(b)(3)(A).  Although we question whether the\nfour episodes of Jade  Fox at issue here were \"included  in a\n                          \nsingle unit  of publication,\" since episodes thirteen through\nsixteen  of Jade  Fox are contained  on two  videotapes, this\n                     \ngoes to  the issue  of TVB's  compliance  with the  copyright\nregulations, not whether Gamma is entitled to multiple awards\nof  statutory  damages.   As  the  legislative  history to   \n504(c)(1)  makes clear, the number of copyright registrations\nis not  the unit of  reference for determining the  number of\nawards of statutory damages.  Moreover, we note that the Twin\n                                                             \nPeaks  court  did  not  rely   on  the  number  of  copyright\n     \nregistrations  in reaching its  result.  See  Twin Peaks, 996\n                                                        \n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\neither  the statute  or  the  corresponding regulations  that\n\nprecludes a copyright  owner from registering the  copyrights\n\nin multiple  works on a single registration  form while still\n\ncollecting an award of statutory damages for the infringement\n\nof each work's copyright.\n\n          With regard  to the  district court's first  point,\n\nthat  Gamma sells  or rents  only complete  Jade Fox  sets to\n                                                    \n\nvideo  stores, we  do not  find this  fact persuasive  in the\n\npresent inquiry.   A distributor's decision  to sell or  rent\n\ncomplete sets of a series to video stores in no way indicates\n\nthat each  episode in the  series is unable to  stand alone.9\n\nMore significant for  present purposes is  the fact that  (1)\n\nviewers who rent the tapes  from their local video stores may\n\nrent as few or as many tapes as they want, may view one, two,\n\nor twenty episodes  in a single sitting, and  may never watch\n\nor rent all of the episodes; and (2) each episode in the Jade\n                                                             \n\nFox series was separately produced.\n   \n\n                    \n\nF.2d at 1381.\n\n9.  If the distributor of the Rocky series of motion pictures\n                                   \nrequired video stores to purchase  all five of the movies, or\nalternatively, packaged the movies as a boxed set for resale,\nthe five movies would not  suddenly become one \"work\" for the\npurpose  of  damages.   See, e.g.,  Cormack v.  Sunshine Food\n                                                             \nStores,  Inc.,  675  F.  Supp.  374,  377  (E.D. Mich.  1987)\n             \n(written  tests  designed  to  detect honesty  and  emotional\nstatus, respectively in  the workplace are not one \"work\" for\nthe  purpose of  statutory  damages  just  because  they  are\npackaged and sold together).\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\n          While our case arguably falls somewhere between the\n\nTwin Peaks and the hypothetical novel turned television mini-\n          \n\nseries scenario presented therein, 996 F.2d at 1381, it  more\n\nclosely resembles  Twin Peaks  than the  hypothetical.   Each\n                             \n\nepisode of Jade Fox was produced independently from the other\n                   \n\nepisodes,  and  each   episode  of  Jade  Fox  was  aired  on\n                                             \n\ntelevision  independently from  the preceding  and subsequent\n\nepisodes.10    In  addition,   unlike  the  \"Tinker,  Tailor,\n\nSoldier, Spy\" hypothetical in  Twin Peaks, our case  does not\n                                         \n\ninvolve the infringement  of a single book, but  rather, much\n\nlike   Twin  Peaks,   involves   the  infringement   of  four\n                  \n\nseparately-produced television episodes prepared as part of a\n\nweekly (or perhaps daily) series.   We conclude that Gamma is\n\nentitled to four  awards of statutory damages  for Ean-Chea's\n\ninfringement of four separate \"works.\" \n\n          As its final  argument on  its cross-appeal,  Gamma\n\ncontests the  district court's attorney's fee award.  The fee\n\napplication requested a total of $80,198.62  and costs in the\n\namount of $7,608.87.   The district court awarded  all of the\n\nrequested  costs,  but  substantially  reduced  Gamma's   fee\n\nrequest,  awarding $12,500.   This reduction  was based  on a\n\nmultitude of factors.\n\n                    \n\n10.  Because  no English  translation  of  the  episodes  was\nprovided below,  the district court  was unable to  study the\nepisodes' plots to gauge their relation to each other.\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\n          Generally speaking,  the district court  found that\n\nGamma had  \"over-prosecuted this  case, pursued  infringement\n\nactions on works that were not registered, and achieved  very\n\nlimited  success.\"  More  specifically, the court  found that\n\nplaintiffs  had  originally  \"filed  a  six-count   complaint\n\nalleging a massive scheme of wrongdoing, ... seeking millions\n\nof dollars in damages,\" and then, armed with a court order,\n\n          raided  Ean-Chea's  store  ... apparently\n          expecting  to  uncover  a huge  cache  of\n          infringing materials.  Instead, what they\n          found  was   a  single  set   of  pirated\n          `Hunters Prey'  tapes located  under some\n          trash in a cardboard  box by the counter,\n          some high speed  video copying equipment,\n          and a business  record that reflected the\n          shipment of  one unauthorized  copy of  a\n          program entitled `Serpentine  Romance' to\n          Montreal.\n\nThe   court  further  noted  that,  as  trial  neared,  Gamma\n\ndismissed the  five non-copyright claims, \"and  conceded that\n\nbecause  [the  copyrights in]  Serpentine Romance  and twelve\n\nepisodes of  Jade Fox  had not been  registered prior  to the\n                     \n\nfiling of the lawsuit, they too fell out of the case.\"\n\n          With  respect to Gamma's fee request, the court had\n\nmuch to say:\n\n          many  of  the [time-sheet]  entries  were\n          extremely  vague,  making   it  virtually\n          impossible  ...   to  determine   whether\n          requested hours were excessive, redundant\n          (especially with respect to how New  York\n          and  local  counsel  divided  tasks),  or\n          otherwise  unnecessary,  as  well  as  to\n          parse  out  attorney  time  and  expenses\n          related  to the  unsuccessful claims  and\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\n          [voluntarily]  dismissed  portion  of the\n          case.\n\nThe district court  then pointed out numerous  ambiguities in\n\nthe  attorneys' records, as well as instances where telephone\n\nconversations  between counsel  were  reflected  only in  the\n\nrecords  of one  of the  two  attorneys.   Finally the  court\n\nprovided   examples  of   charges   that  appeared   facially\n\nexcessive, such as billing the client for leaving a telephone\n\nmessage when  the person  telephoned was  absent.   The court\n\nsettled  on  a   fee  award  that  it   believed  represented\n\nreasonable compensation for the nature of the work performed,\n\ntaking into account how much time was actually expended.\n\n          The  district  court  found  that  the   time-sheet\n\nentries submitted  by  Gamma's attorney's  were so  ambiguous\n\nthat  it was  not clear  which  claims in  the complaint  the\n\nentries related  to.  For  example, the district  court noted\n\nentries that stated merely \"Draft documents,\" \"Work on Case,\"\n\n\"Review of  Discovery,\" and  \"study file,  legal research  re\n\nMass. case.\"\n\n          We review fee  awards for abuse of  discretion, see\n                                                             \n\nFoley  v.

Gamma is,  of course, entitled to  costs on\n\nappeal.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          On  Ean-Chea's appeal, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.   On Gamma's cross-appeal, the judgment of\n\nthe  district court is  affirmed except  that we  reverse its\n\nfinding as  to the number  of \"works\" infringed upon  by Ean-\n\nChea for the  purpose of calculating  statutory damages.   We\n\nhold that  Ean-Chea infringed upon  four works, not one.   We\n\ntherefore vacate the district court's judgment ordering  Ean-\n\nChea to pay Gamma $2,500  in statutory damages, and remand to\n\nthe district  court for  a redetermination  of damages  based\n\nupon our holding.\n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n</pre>",
