This appeal is the  aftermath\n                                 \n\nof a lawsuit brought  by six members of the Warren family against\n\nmembers  of the Lynn  Police Department and  the city  of Lynn to\n\nredress violations of the Warrens' federal and state civil rights\n\nsuffered when five family members  were arrested, and the  family\n\nhome unlawfully searched, on August 16, 1985.  On that evening, a\n\nconvenience  store in  East  Lynn was  robbed  at gunpoint.    In\n\nfollowing up  on  this robbery,  defendant  members of  the  Lynn\n\npolice force ended up at the Warren  home, over a mile and a half\n\naway from the store.  There, they ultimately arrested five family\n\nmembers, engaged in  an illegal  search of their  home and  their\n\npersons,  and  falsely imprisoned  at  least  one family  member.\n\nPlaintiffs were  not prosecuted  in connection with  the robbery,\n\nand were acquitted of various  charges of assault and  disorderly\n\nconduct in connection with their arrests.\n\n     A  jury found five of  the Lynn policemen  guilty of various\n\nviolations of the Warrens'  federal and state civil rights.   The\n\ncity  of  Lynn  and  some  half  dozen  other  officers  received\n\ndefendants'  verdicts.     Punitive  damages   had  been  waived;\n\ncompensatory  damages  were  awarded  in the  amount  of  $2,500.\n\nPlaintiffs sought  an award of  $85,566.25 in  counsel fees,  and\n\ncosts  of $4,094.71.   The  court awarded  costs and  $50,000 for\n\ncounsel fees.\n\n     Appellants challenge the court's  denial of their motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdicts and the award of attorney's\n\n                               -2-\n\nfees and costs.   Before we can  address the merits, however,  we\n\nmust face the issue of our appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                      Appellate Jurisdiction\n                                            \n\n     1. The facts.   This appeal initially was filed  on June 14,\n                 \n\n1991.   On July  3, 1991,  noting a  number of  potentially fatal\n\njurisdictional defects (including  the pendency of  an additional\n\npost-judgment  motion  and  the  lack of  separate  documents  of\n\njudgment),  we  issued an  order to  show  cause why  this appeal\n\nshould not be dismissed.  We cited to our court's  panel decision\n\nin Fiore  v. Washington County Community Health  Center, 936 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n51  (1st  Cir.  1991),  withdrawn  and  superseded  by  Fiore  v.\n                                                             \n\nWashington County Community Health Center, 960 F.2d 229 (1st Cir.\n                                         \n\n1992)  (en banc), in which,  confronted with the  question of how\n\nthe  \"separate document\" requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 should\n\nbe applied  in the context of post-judgment motions, we concluded\n\nthat meticulous compliance was necessary.1\n\n     Shortly before our show  cause order, on June 21,  1991, the\n\ndistrict  court denied  the remaining  post-judgment motion.   On\n\nJuly 15, 1991 the  defendants voluntarily dismissed their appeal.\n\nOn March 30, 1992, we issued our en banc decision in Fiore, which\n                                                          \n\nreaffirmed the  basic position  originally adopted by  the panel,\n\nrequiring  \"meticulous compliance\"  with  the  separate  document\n\nrule,  and holding that  when a party  fails to pursue  an appeal\n\nwithin three months of the court's last order in the case, waiver\n\n                    \n\n1Rule 58 requires that \"[e]very judgment shall be set forth  on a\nseparate document,\" and provides  that \"[a] judgment is effective\nonly when so set forth . . . .\"\n\n                               -3-\n\nof  the separate  document requirement should  be inferred.   960\n\nF.2d at 231, 236.   Appellants still took no action for  over two\n\nmore months.  In June and July, 1992,  they made several feckless\n\nattempts,  by  letters  and  conversations,  to  obtain  separate\n\ndocuments from the clerk's office; nothing was  forthcoming.  Not\n\nuntil October 8, 1992, fifteen and one half months after the last\n\norder in the case was  issued by the district court,  and fifteen\n\nmonths after our show  cause order, did appellants file  a motion\n\nfor entry of judgment and for issuance of separate documents.  \n\n     On March 25, 1993, the district court allowed the motion for\n\nentry  of judgment,  but, in  a margin  order, denied  the motion\n\nrequesting  that  the court's  post-trial  orders  be entered  on\n\nseparate  documents.  On April  14, 1993, the  appellants filed a\n\nsecond appeal.  We then issued another show cause order, pointing\n\nto the fact that,  according to the district court  docket sheet,\n\nthe  last order denying a  post-judgment motion in  this case had\n\nbeen entered  on June 21, 1991.   We noted that  under Fiore, 960\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 236, absent  exceptional circumstances, a party's failure\n\nto act within three months of a court's last order in a case will\n\nbe  deemed  a waiver  of  application  of the  separate  document\n\nrequirement.   Upon receipt  of appellants' response,  we allowed\n\nthe appeal to proceed and referred decision on the jurisdictional\n\nissue to the present panel.\n\n     2.  Discussion.  In both the panel  and en banc decisions in\n                                                    \n\nFiore,  we held that  Rule 58 should apply  to all orders denying\n     \n\npost-judgment motions.    Not  only  did  we  conclude  that  the\n\n                               -4-\n\nlanguage of both Rule  58 and Rule  4(a) requires this, but  also\n\nthat there was a  need for an \"unambiguous  signal that the  time\n\nfor  appeal has begun  to run.\"   960 F.2d at  233.  The  en banc\n                                                                 \n\ncourt  reaffirmed the  clear holding  of the  panel  that parties\n\ncould   not  sleep   on  their   rights  to   separate  documents\n\nindefinitely, but,  barring exceptional circumstances,  must take\n\naction within three months following entry  of judgment, or waive\n\napplication  of the  separate  document requirement.   The  court\n\nstated:\n\n     If  we  were  to  hold  without  qualification  that  a\n     judgment is not final until the court issues a separate\n     document, we  would open  up the possibility  that long\n     dormant cases could be  revived years after the parties\n     had considered them to be over.  \n\nId. at 236. \n   \n\n     We therefore announced:\n\n     We   believe   it   appropriate,   absent   exceptional\n     circumstances, to  infer waiver where a  party fails to\n     act within three  months of the  court's last order  in\n     the case.  . . .   A party wishing to  pursue an appeal\n     and awaiting the separate document of judgment from the\n     trial court can,  and should, within that period file a\n     motion for entry of judgment. Id.\n                                      \n\n     Contrary to  appellants' claims, both the panel  and en banc\n                                                                 \n\ndecisions in Fiore are unambiguous  in outlining the waiver rule.\n                  \n\nAnd appellants still  waited over  six months after  the en  banc\n                                                                 \n\ndecision to file their motion.2\n\n                    \n\n2At oral argument,  when questioned about  this six month  delay,\nappellants'  counsel replied:  \"I hadn't  read the en  banc Fiore\n                                                                 \ndecision.  At that time, we didn't realize that there was a three\nmonth  period  until  it was  brought  to  our  attention by  the\nplaintiffs .  . .   shortly  before we filed  the motion.\"   They\nfurther  stated  that \"other  than not  knowing\"  of the  en banc\n                                                                 \ndecision in  Fiore, there were no  special circumstances excusing\n                  \n\n                               -5-\n\n     Appellants seek refuge under the \"exceptional circumstances\"\n\nrubric  by pointing to their attempts to raise the clerk's office\n\nto  action by  oral  and letter  requests.   But  inattention  or\n\ninadvertence  by  the court  short  of  active misleading  cannot\n\nexcuse  counsel from  his  duty of  diligence.   This  is why  we\n\nspecifically have instructed counsel \"wishing to pursue an appeal\n\nand awaiting the separate document of judgment,\" 960 F.2d 236, to\n\nfile a motion for entry of judgment.\n\n     We therefore must dismiss this  appeal for lack of appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\n                      No manifest injustice\n                                           \n\n     We add that this  case is not  an example of a  technicality\n\ndefeating justice.   We have considered  appellants' arguments on\n\nthe merits and find them unimpressive.  \n\n     Their  claim that  plaintiffs  were  not prevailing  parties\n\nwould have  failed under  Farrar v.  Hobby, 113  S. Ct.  566, 573\n                                          \n\n(1992), in which the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who wins\n\nnominal damages is  a prevailing  party under 42  U.S.C.    1988.\n\nHere more than nominal damages were awarded.  Meaningful  awards,\n\npayable by individual officers  in recognition of their violation\n\nof plaintiffs' constitutional rights, made this the kind  of case\n\nin   which   \"the  court   may   consider   the  vindication   of\n\nconstitutional  rights  in  addition  to the  amount  of  damages\n\n                    \n\nthe delay between the time that decision was issued on  March 30,\n1992, and the filing  of their motion with the  district court on\nOctober 8, 1992.\n\n                               -6-\n\nrecovered.\"   Riverside  v.  Rivera,  477  U.S. 561,  585  (1986)\n                                   \n\n(Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  \n\n     Our denial  of  fees to  a plaintiff  who had  won a  $1,000\n\nverdict  in  Lewis v.  Kendrick, 944  F.2d  949 (1st  Cir. 1991),\n                               \n\ncannot  compel  a  finding  that the  district  court  abused its\n\ndiscretion here.   In Lewis,  the amount won  was less  than half\n                           \n\nthat  awarded  here.    More  importantly,  in  contrast  to  the\n\nsituation of  the plaintiffs in the  case at bar, the  court felt\n\nthat  the plaintiff in Lewis  had \"failed entirely  or largely in\n                            \n\neverything,\"    id.  at 955,  and  that  there  had been  extreme\n                   \n\noverreaching in the request for fees, id. at 956.\n                                         \n\n     Appellants'   claim   that  judgments   notwithstanding  the\n\nverdicts  should have  been granted  rests on  the  argument that\n\nunder  the Massachusetts Civil  Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann.\n\nch.  12,    11H and 11I (West 1986), interference with a person's\n\nrights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or the\n\nCommonwealth must be by  \"threats, intimidation or coercion,\" and\n\nthat there was no evidence of such in this case.\n\n     The  Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court,  however, while\n\nholding that there must be  measures directed toward a particular\n\nindividual  or   class,  has  found  sufficient  intimidation  or\n\ncoercion to satisfy  the Act where  a uniformed security  officer\n\nordered  a  plaintiff to  stop  soliciting  and distributing  his\n\npolitical handbills,  see Batchelder v. Allied  Stores Corp., 473\n                                                            \n\nN.E.2d  1128, 1130,  393  Mass. 819,  823  (1985), and  where  an\n\norchestra canceled its contract with a performer, see Redgrave v.\n                                                              \n\n                               -7-\n\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., 502 N.E.2d 1375, 1378, 399 Mass.\n                               \n\n93,  100 (1987), since the effect of  these actions was to coerce\n\nthe  plaintiffs  not  to  exercise  rights  to  which  they  were\n\nentitled.   See  Batchelder, 473  N.E.2d at  1131;  Redgrave, 502\n                                                            \n\nN.E.2d at 1379. \n\n     When  we review the events  in this case  -- the policemen's\n\nforcible descent on plaintiffs  at their home, the  beatings, the\n\novernight  incarcerations,  and  a  search  based  on  perjurious\n\nevidence --  we can understand  how the jury,  under instructions\n\nnot challenged, could have found the existence of threats of harm\n\nwithin  the  meaning  of  the  Massachusetts  Civil  Rights  Act,\n\nparticularly in  light of plaintiffs' claim  that the policemen's\n\nbehavior was aggravated by protest against their arrests.  \n\n     We therefore conclude that the serious procedural default of\n\nappellants, resulting in our  lack of appellate jurisdiction, has\n\nnot led to any unjust result.  \n\n     Affirmed.

We cited to our court's panel decision in  Fiore v. Washington County Community Health Center, 936 F.2d 51 (1st Cir. 1991),  withdrawn and superseded by Fiore v. Washington County Community Health Center, 960 F.2d 229 (1st Cir. 1992) (en banc), in which, confronted with the question of how the \"separate document\" requirement of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 58 should be applied in the context of post-judgment motions, we concluded that meticulous compliance was necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before our show cause order, on June 21, 1991, the district court denied the remaining post-judgment motion.  On July 15, 1991 the defendants voluntarily dismissed their appeal.  On March 30, 1992, we issued our en banc decision in Fiore, which reaffirmed the basic position originally adopted by the panel, requiring \"meticulous compliance\" with the separate document rule, and holding that when a party fails to pursue an appeal within three months of the court's last order in the case, waiver of the separate document requirement should be inferred.  960 F.2d at 231, 236.  Appellants still took no action for over two more months.  In June and July, 1992, they made several feckless attempts, by letters and conversations, to obtain separate documents from the clerk's office;  nothing was forthcoming.  Not until October 8, 1992, fifteen and one half months after the last order in the case was issued by the district court, and fifteen months after our show cause order, did appellants file a motion for entry of judgment and for issuance of separate documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 25, 1993, the district court allowed the motion for entry of judgment, but, in a margin order, denied the motion requesting that the court's post-trial orders be entered on separate documents.  On April 14, 1993, the appellants filed a second appeal.  We then issued another show cause order, pointing to the fact that, according to the district court docket sheet, the last order denying a post-judgment motion in this case had been entered on June 21, 1991.  We noted that under  Fiore, 960 F.2d at 236, absent exceptional circumstances, a party's failure to act within three months of a court's last order in a case will be deemed a waiver of application of the separate document requirement.  Upon receipt of appellants' response, we allowed the appeal to proceed and referred decision on the jurisdictional issue to the present panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Discussion.  In both the panel and en banc decisions in Fiore, we held that Rule 58 should apply to all orders denying post-judgment motions.  Not only did we conclude that the language of both Rule 58 and Rule 4(a) requires this, but also that there was a need for an \"unambiguous signal that the time for appeal has begun to run.\"  960 F.2d at 233.  The en banc court reaffirmed the clear holding of the panel that parties could not sleep on their rights to separate documents indefinitely, but, barring exceptional circumstances, must take action within three months following entry of judgment, or waive application of the separate document requirement.  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to hold without qualification that a judgment is not final until the court issues a separate document, we would open up the possibility that long dormant cases could be revived years after the parties had considered them to be over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We therefore announced:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe it appropriate, absent exceptional circumstances, to infer waiver where a party fails to act within three months of the court's last order in the case....

Here more than nominal damages were awarded.  Meaningful awards, payable by individual officers in recognition of their violation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights, made this the kind of case in which \"the court may consider the vindication of constitutional rights in addition to the amount of damages recovered.\"   Riverside v.

Kendrick, 944 F.2d 949 (1st Cir. 1991), cannot compel a finding that the district court abused its discretion here.  In Lewis, the amount won was less than half that awarded here.  More importantly, in contrast to the situation of the plaintiffs in the case at bar, the court felt that the plaintiff in Lewis had \"failed entirely or largely in everything,\"  id. at 955, and that there had been extreme overreaching in the request for fees,  id. at 956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' claim that judgments notwithstanding the verdicts should have been granted rests on the argument that under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen.

Allied Stores Corp., 473 N.E.2d 1128, 1130, 393 Mass. 819, 823 (1985), and where an orchestra canceled its contract with a performer,  see Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., 502 N.E.2d 1375, 1378, 399 Mass. 93, 100 (1987), since the effect of these actions was to coerce the plaintiffs not to exercise rights to which they were entitled.

On that evening, a convenience store in East Lynn was robbed at gunpoint.  In following up on this robbery, defendant members of the Lynn police force ended up at the Warren home, over a mile and a half away from the store.  There, they ultimately arrested five family members, engaged in an illegal search of their home and their persons, and falsely imprisoned at least one family member.  Plaintiffs were not prosecuted in connection with the robbery, and were acquitted of various charges of assault and disorderly conduct in connection with their arrests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury found five of the Lynn policemen guilty of various violations of the Warrens' federal and state civil rights.  The city of Lynn and some half dozen other officers received defendants' verdicts.  Punitive damages had been waived;  compensatory damages were awarded in the amount of $2,500.  Plaintiffs sought an award of $85,566.25 in counsel fees, and costs of $4,094.71.
