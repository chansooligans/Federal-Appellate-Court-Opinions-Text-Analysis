Jefferson Melish for appellants.\n     Marc DeSisto, with whom Mark A. McSally, Town Solicitor,\nKelly, Kelleher, Reilly & Simpson, and DeSisto Law were on brief,\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n                         January 5, 2011\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.          The town of Narragansett (the\n\nTown), a sleepy seaside community in southern Rhode Island, boasts\n\nsome of the most beautiful beaches on the eastern seaboard.              Each\n\nsummer, the Town experiences a substantial influx of seasonal\n\nresidents. Each fall, the Town empties out, leaving a large number\n\nof dwellings unoccupied. The Town's proximity to the University of\n\nRhode Island (URI) makes these dwellings attractive for student\n\nhousing.\n\n           This thriving rental market among college students has\n\nproven to be both a blessing and a curse.           On the one hand, the\n\nclamor for student housing is an economic boon to property owners\n\nwilling to rent their dwellings.        On the other hand, the sheer mass\n\nof exuberant young people and their predilections have proven to be\n\na threat to the quality of life in a quiet enclave.\n\n           In an effort to balance these competing concerns, the\n\nTown adopted a novel ordinance authorizing local police officers to\n\npost a bright orange sticker at the front entrance of any residence\n\nfound to have hosted an \"unruly gathering.\"         The ordinance has had\n\nits   detractors,   and   this   case   was   brought   as   a   multifaceted\n\nchallenge to it.     The challengers complain that the ordinance is\n\nboth preempted by state law and unconstitutional on its face.\n\n           The district court, in a thoughtful and comprehensive\n\nrescript, rejected these plaints.         See URI Student Senate v. Town\n\nof Narragansett, 707 F. Supp. 2d 282 (D.R.I. 2010).              After careful\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fconsideration, we find that the Town's unorthodox solution to the\n\nproblems caused by unruly gatherings does not, on its face, offend\n\neither state law or the United States Constitution.                  Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            We    first    recount     the     circumstances    surrounding     the\n\nadoption of the ordinance and summarize its terms.                   We then limn\n\nthe travel of the case.\n\n                                 A.   The Ordinance.\n\n            The    Narragansett        Town    Council   initially    adopted    an\n\n\"unruly gatherings\" ordinance in 2005.              It amended that ordinance\n\nin 2007.    The amended version (the Ordinance), codified at chapter\n\n46, article II, of the Town's Code of Ordinances, remains in force.\n\nWe refer throughout to that version, which is reprinted in the\n\nappendix.\n\n            Section 46-31 of the Ordinance empowers local police\n\nofficers to intervene at and disperse gatherings that are sparking\n\n\"a substantial disturbance.\"            The police may only do so, however,\n\nwhen the disturbance involves \"a violation of law.\" Subsection (a)\n\nprovides an illustrative list of instances of unlawful conduct that\n\nmight   constitute        such    a    violation    (e.g.,     excessive   noise,\n\nobstruction of public streets, illegal parking, public drunkenness\n\nor urination, service of alcohol to minors).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                Once the police have abated and dispersed an unruly\n\ngathering, subsection 46-32(a) authorizes them to prominently post\n\na notice on the premises.           This notice takes the form of a bright\n\norange ten-by-fourteen-inch sticker, which is affixed on or near\n\nthe front entrance of the building.1                    The sticker contains an\n\nexplicit message.           It admonishes that, should police intervention\n\nbe required in response to another violation at the same address\n\nduring the same posting period, various parties (e.g., the owners\n\nand    residents       of   the   premises,      the    sponsors    of    the    unruly\n\ngathering, and any guests who cause a nuisance) will be held\n\njointly and severally liable.              Landlords are informed by mail of\n\nboth the posting and the violation that led to it.\n\n                The   Ordinance    makes    explicit      allowance      for    certain\n\ndefenses to prosecution for a subsequent violation.                      For example,\n\nunder       subsection      46-34(a)(5),    a    showing    that    only   uninvited\n\nparticipants engaged in the proscribed conduct serves as a defense\n\nfor innocent landlords, tenants, or event sponsors. To assert this\n\ndefense, a landlord, tenant, or sponsor must show that she took\n\n\"all        steps   reasonably    necessary      to    exclude\"    the   responsible\n\n\n        1\n       The record does not explain why the color orange was\nselected. Thus, like Nathaniel Hawthorne reflecting on a similar\nconundrum, one wonders if there is \"some deep meaning in it, most\nworthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth\nfrom the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to [one's]\nsensibilities, but evading the analysis of [one's] mind.\"\nNathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter, intro. (1850). In the\nend, however, the choice of hue, though perplexing, is not relevant\nto the issues on appeal.\n\n                                           -4-\n\findividuals.   As to landlords, such exclusionary actions include\n\n\"actively attempting\" to evict boisterous tenants.\n\n           The posting periods prescribed by subsection 46-32(a)\n\ncorrespond with the economic realities of the seasonal housing\n\ncycle.   If a building is posted between the beginning of September\n\nand the end of May, the sticker must remain in place until May 31.\n\nIf a building is posted between the beginning of June and the end\n\nof August, the sticker must remain in place until August 31.\n\n           Under subsection 46-32(b), landlords and tenants are\n\njointly responsible for maintaining the notice in place.       If a\n\nlandlord or tenant removes the sticker, abets its removal, or\n\ntampers with it during the posting period, she is subject to a\n\nfine.\n\n           Section 46-35 delineates the penalties associated with\n\ninfractions at previously posted dwellings.   Under subsection (a),\n\nthe first post-posting intervention during a given posting period\n\nincurs a $300 fine; the second, a $400 fine; and any further\n\nintervention, a $500 fine.   Under subsection (b), violators may be\n\nrequired to perform community service or, for repeat offenders,\n\ncommunity service is mandatory.\n\n           The Town routinely compiles statistics relating to its\n\nenforcement of the Ordinance.     Its roster of offending dwellings\n\nincludes all addresses at which police officers have intervened to\n\nabate and disperse unruly gatherings.     It also maintains a list\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthat features data relating to Ordinance violations committed by\n\nURI students.\n\n                       B.    Travel of the Case.\n\n            In May of 2008, the appellants challenged the Ordinance\n\nin a Rhode Island court.      The defendants removed the case to the\n\ndistrict court in pursuance of federal question jurisdiction.          See\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.\n\n            The lead plaintiff-appellant is the URI Student Senate,\n\nwhich claims to represent the interests of URI students generally.\n\nThe remaining plaintiffs, also appellants here, can be sorted into\n\nthree    categories.   The   first    group   comprises   individual   URI\n\nstudents who reside in Narragansett and have felt the sting of the\n\nOrdinance.    These appellants claim, among other things, that they\n\nhave been subjected to university disciplinary procedures as a\n\nresult of violating the Ordinance.2        The second group consists of\n\nURI students whose rented abodes have been posted with orange\n\nstickers. These appellants claim that they were evicted from their\n\nhomes and referred to the URI Student Life Office as a result.         The\n\nlast group comprises landlords who have had their rental properties\n\nposted.    These appellants claim that they have been unable to re-\n\nrent their properties and, consequently, have lost rental income.\n\n\n\n     2\n       Criminal prosecution of those individuals for subsequent\nviolations was underway in municipal court prior to the\ncommencement of this suit. These proceedings have been held in\nabeyance.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fThe defendants, appellees here, are the Town and a galaxy of\n\nmunicipal officials.        For ease in exposition, we refer to the Town\n\nas if it were the sole defendant.\n\n             The complaint is cast mostly, but not entirely, as a\n\nseries of constitutional challenges. The exception is a preemption\n\nclaim positing that the Ordinance is preempted by a state statute.\n\nThe constitutional claims allege variously that the Ordinance (i)\n\nviolates substantive due process, (ii) is unconstitutionally vague,\n\n(iii) is overbroad, (iv) offends the requirements of procedural due\n\nprocess, and (v) deprives the appellants of equal protection of the\n\nlaw.\n\n             In    due   season,   the   parties   cross-moved   for   summary\n\njudgment on stipulated facts.              The district court denied the\n\nappellants' motion and granted the cross-motion.                 URI Student\n\nSenate, 707 F. Supp. 2d at 304.           The court expressed concern about\n\nthe absence of any pre-posting opportunity to challenge the orange\n\nstickers, id. at 296, 302, but nonetheless upheld the Ordinance.\n\nThis timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n             We begin our analysis with the preemption claim and then\n\nmove    to   the   constitutional    claims.       Before   undertaking   this\n\nexegesis, we pause to memorialize the standard of review.\n\n             We review an appeal from the entry of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    Osediacz v. City of Cranston, 414 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f2005).      In   so   doing,   we     take       the   facts   and   all   reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.     Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v. Serrano-Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).        \"We will affirm only if the record reveals 'no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact' and 'the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.'\"                  Vineberg v. Bissonnette, 548\n\nF.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)).\n\n                                 A.      Preemption.\n\n            The appellants assert that the Ordinance is preempted by\n\nthe Rhode Island Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (L&T Act),\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-18-1 to 34-18-57.                  As its title implies, the\n\nL&T Act speaks to the rights and obligations of landlords and\n\ntenants within Rhode Island.               See id. §§ 34-18-2, 34-18-7.            In\n\nadvocating preemption, the appellants rely on section 34-18-36,\n\nwhich gives most tenants the right to cure any material breach of\n\na rental agreement prior to eviction.3\n\n            Under Rhode Island law, a municipal ordinance may be\n\npreempted by a state statutory scheme either if the ordinance\n\nconflicts with the statutory scheme or if it can be shown that the\n\nGeneral Assembly intended its statutory scheme to occupy the whole\n\nof   the   regulatory    field      in    connection      with   a   given   subject.\n\n\n\n      3\n       The L&T Act makes separate provisions for what it calls\n\"seasonal\" tenants. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36(f). The case at\nhand does not turn on any such distinction and, thus, we refer to\ntenants generally.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fAmico's Inc. v. Mattos, 789 A.2d 899, 907 (R.I. 2002); Town of\n\nWarren v. Thornton-Whitehouse, 740 A.2d 1255, 1261 (R.I. 1999).\n\nThe appellants' preemption argument rests on the first of these\n\nlines of attack: the supposed existence of a conflict between the\n\nOrdinance and the L&T Act.4\n\n          The appellants contend that the Ordinance conflicts with\n\nsection 34-18-36 of the L&T Act because it \"requires\" a landlord to\n\nevict an offending tenant without providing the tenant with an\n\nopportunity to cure.   Eviction is required, the appellants say, so\n\nthat the landlord can avoid liability for subsequent Ordinance\n\nviolations at posted properties.\n\n          This argument represents a triumph of hope over reason.\n\nThe Ordinance does not require a landlord to initiate eviction\n\nproceedings against an offending tenant.      Rather, section 46-\n\n34(a)(5) explains that the owner of a previously posted property\n\nmay avoid liability for a subsequent unruly gathering at that\n\nlocation as long as the owner is \"actively attempting to evict a\n\ntenant from the premises.\"     Affording the landlord an \"ongoing\n\neviction\" defense is not tantamount, either legally or practically,\n\nto compelling him to institute eviction proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       In their opening brief, the appellants make a passing\nreference to section 34-18-7 as a possible source of field\npreemption. This reference is not developed in any way and, thus,\nno field preemption argument is properly before us. See United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                -9-\n\f            The appellants try to dodge this bullet. They note that,\n\nunder the L&T Act, the first step in evicting a tenant is the\n\nissuance of a noncompliance notice.                R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36.\n\nThe appellants declare that this provision grounds a preemption\n\nclaim because sending a notice of noncompliance is antithetic to an\n\nactive attempt at eviction.\n\n            This ipse dixit is not accompanied by any explanation as\n\nto   why   or   how    the    transmittal    of    a    notice   of   noncompliance\n\ninterferes with, let alone negates, the active pursuit of eviction.\n\nBearing in mind that sending such a notice is the first step in the\n\neviction pavane, the two acts seem entirely compatible. Certainly,\n\nthere is nothing in either the text of the Ordinance or the letter\n\nof the L&T Act that precludes simultaneous compliance with both.\n\n            In all events, conflict preemption requires a direct\n\nconflict or something very close to it.                  See, e.g., Freightliner\n\nCorp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287 (1995) (explaining that implied\n\nconflict preemption may exist where it is \"impossible for a . . .\n\nparty to comply with both . . . requirements\" or where a provision\n\n\"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\n\nfull   purposes       and    objectives\"    of    the   legislature    (quotations\n\nomitted)).      An awkward fit, without more, will not support a claim\n\nof conflict preemption.\n\n            In the instant case, we are unable to discern either a\n\ndirect conflict or an irreconcilable inconsistency between the\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fprovisions of the Ordinance and the provisions of the L&T Act.                We\n\ntherefore hold, without serious question, that the L&T Act does not\n\npreempt the Ordinance.\n\n                          B.    Constitutional Claims.\n\n                 The appellants advance a compendium of constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Ordinance.          Because they have not pressed either\n\ntheir generalized substantive due process or equal protection\n\nclaims, we eschew any further discussion of those initiatives.\n\nWithout exception, what remains are facial challenges.5\n\n                 1. Procedural Due Process. We start with the contention\n\nthat       the    Ordinance    deprives    both   landlords   and   tenants   of\n\nprocedural due process. The appellants pounce on the fact that the\n\nOrdinance allows the police to plaster an orange sticker on a\n\ndwelling without affording either the landlord or the tenants any\n\nopportunity for a hearing.6\n\n\n       5\n       At oral argument, the appellants stated that they were\nmaking both facial and as-applied challenges. The record belies\nthat statement. Although their brief characterizes the complaint\nas contesting the Ordinance \"on its face and as applied,\" the\nappellants argued the case in the district court as a facial\nchallenge and the district court decided it on that basis. See URI\nStudent Senate, 707 F. Supp. 2d at 288.        That approach was\nunavoidable as the appellants failed to introduce any evidence\nsufficient to underpin an as-applied challenge.\n       6\n        No specific claim is made in this case that persons\nexonerated from charges brought under the Ordinance have been\nunable either to get the orange stickers removed from their\nresidences or to have their names and addresses expunged from the\nrosters of offenders and offending sites. Cf. Los Angeles Cnty. v.\nHumphries, 562 U.S. ___, slip op. at 2 (2010) (addressing 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 claim brought by plaintiffs who were accused of child abuse,\n\n                                          -11-\n\f            It is familiar lore that the essence of procedural due\n\nprocess is prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.             Bd. of\n\nRegents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573 (1972).        But this principle does\n\nnot operate in a vacuum.            In order to show a deprivation of\n\nprocedural due process, a party must first show that the challenged\n\naction implicates a constitutionally protected liberty or property\n\ninterest.    Id. at 569-70; Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of HUD, 421\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005); see also U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\n\n            In an effort to cross this threshold, the appellants\n\nfocus on reputational harm, that is, the allegedly stigmatizing\n\neffects of the Ordinance. They say that when a residence is posted\n\nwith an orange sticker, both the landlord and the tenants are\n\npublicly branded as criminals.             They add that this stigma is\n\nheightened by the Town's action in keeping a publicly available\n\nregister of all posted premises.\n\n            Student    tenants   are    alleged   to   suffer   a   further\n\ndetriment.    When an orange sticker is posted on premises occupied\n\nby a university student, the Town informs URI.         In the appellants'\n\nview, this additional step exposes student tenants to disciplinary\n\nproceedings    and    exacerbates    the    stigmatizing   effect   of   the\n\npostings.\n\n\n\n\nlater exonerated, yet were unable to convince relevant officials to\nremove their names from a widely available central index).\n\n                                     -12-\n\f              This    argument   cannot    withstand   scrutiny.     In\n\nconstitutional jurisprudence, stigmatization is a term of art. The\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that a procedural due process claim\n\ncannot rest upon reputational harm alone.       Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S.\n\n693, 701 (1976).       Thus, when a person alleges that she has suffered\n\nstigmatization at the hands of a government actor, she must show an\n\nadverse effect on some interest \"more tangible\" than reputational\n\nharm.   Id.    To use the popular catch phrase, the complaining party\n\nmust satisfy a \"stigma plus\" standard.            Pendleton v. City of\n\nHaverhill, 156 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              The \"plus\" part of this formulation is not an empty\n\nformality.     In determining whether there exists a cognizable harm,\n\nthe stigma plus standard requires us to address two distinct\n\ncomponents: (i) the nature of the incremental harm to which the\n\nappellants point and (ii) the source of that harm.\n\n              A party who claims a violation of her procedural due\n\nprocess rights based on reputational harm must show that the\n\nchallenged governmental action adversely impacted some right or\n\nstatus previously enjoyed by her under substantive state or federal\n\nlaw.    See Paul, 424 U.S. at 710-12; Silva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 1997).        For this purpose, harm to a right or status\n\nthat does not emanate from substantive state or federal law is\n\ninsufficient.        Such harm thus does not qualify as harm to a more\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\ftangible interest within the purview of the stigma plus standard.\n\nSee Pendleton, 156 F.3d at 63.\n\n              The nature of the affected interest is not the only\n\nhurdle that a complaining party must overcome in order to satisfy\n\nthe stigma plus standard. The standard requires that the change in\n\nrights   or    status   be    directly   attributable     to   the   challenged\n\ngovernmental action.         Id.   Where the stigma and the incremental\n\nharm — the \"plus\" factor — derive from distinct sources, a party\n\ncannot make out a viable procedural due process claim.               See, e.g.,\n\nHawkins v. R.I. Lottery Comm'n, 238 F.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThat is true even if both sources are government entities.              See id.\n\n              The appellants acknowledge that a showing beyond purely\n\nreputational harm is required by the stigma plus standard. To meet\n\nthat requirement, they describe two injuries that they claim result\n\nfrom the postings.7\n\n              First, the appellants aver that the L&T Act provides them\n\nwith rights \"to housing, to cure breaches, to notice, [and] to\n\npossession.\"      Second, they tout the \"right to rent and live in\n\nNarragansett free of public branding.\"           These rights, they insist,\n\nimplicate     protected      liberty   and    property   interests,    and   the\n\ninfringement of them suffices to trigger the stigma plus standard.\n\n\n     7\n        In their discussion of procedural due process, the\nappellants repeatedly mention that a posting under the Ordinance\nexposes them to prosecution and fines. But they neither present\nthis exposure as a \"plus\" factor nor otherwise tie it to any\nspecific legal doctrine.\n\n                                       -14-\n\f             There is, however, no cognizable harm.          The appellants\n\nsay   that   some   landlords    have   been   unable   to   re-rent   posted\n\ndwellings.    Taking this as true, the resulting loss of rent is not\n\na viable \"plus\" factor.         Nothing in the L&T Act (or elsewhere in\n\nstate law, for that matter) confers on landlords an entitlement to\n\nhave rental units fully occupied.        Rather, the L&T Act for the most\n\npart leaves the negotiation of leases and rates to the marketplace\n\n— that is, to the landlord and each prospective tenant.            See R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 34-18-15(a).        This framework plainly contemplates that\n\nrental income is contingent on the availability of willing renters.\n\nViewed against this backdrop, it cannot seriously be suggested that\n\nstate law creates an entitlement to a steady stream of rental\n\nincome that would qualify as a \"more tangible\" interest (and, thus,\n\nas a \"plus\" factor).\n\n             Similarly, the vacancies that the appellants lament do\n\nnot result from state action but, rather, from the actions of third\n\nparties.     After all, it is prospective tenants, acting without\n\ngovernment compulsion, who decide whether or not to rent particular\n\ndwellings.    A prospective tenant can base her decision not to rent\n\non a multitude of factors including cost, location, amenities, and\n\ncondition. There is nothing that prevents her, as a private party,\n\nfrom weighing in this balance the presence of an orange sticker.\n\nThese third-party decisions are not attributable to state action in\n\nthe requisite sense.     See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922,\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f937-39 (1982) (describing circumstances in which private party's\n\nactions may be considered \"fairly attributable\" to the state);\n\nLogiodice v. Trs. of Me. Cent. Inst., 296 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (similar).    When a specified harm is predicated on voluntary\n\nthird-party   behavior,   it   cannot   serve    as   a   \"plus\"   factor.\n\nPendleton, 156 F.3d at 63.\n\n          The student tenants' proposed \"plus\" factor is no more\n\nrobust.   This claim relies on evictions as a source of harm.           It\n\nsuggests that a tenant has a right to peaceable enjoyment of a\n\nrented dwelling free from eviction and that, therefore, eviction\n\nrepresents a cognizable \"plus\" factor.          This is too sanguine a\n\nview.\n\n          The student tenants' claim is defeated by the fact that\n\ntheir residential rights derive primarily from private contracts\n\n(leases) between private parties (landlords and tenants), which\n\nentail private obligations.    The L&T Act does not itself create a\n\nright to tenancies of any particular duration.              In the last\n\nanalysis, it is the lease terms (and the tenant's compliance with\n\nthem) that generally determine the tenant's right to remain in a\n\nrented dwelling.8    That is dispositive because a constitutionally\n\n\n\n     8\n        Of course, under the L&T Act a tenant \"charged with\nviolating a municipal ordinance\" may be subject to an expedited\neviction. R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36(f). Although this provision\nmay constitute a basis, beyond the explicit terms of the lease, for\nterminating a tenancy more quickly, it does not create a property\ninterest outside of the lease.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fprotected     property   interest    must   rest    on    a   right   or   status\n\nconferred by state law, not merely on the complaining party's\n\nunilateral expectations.      See Paul, 424 U.S. at 710-11; Roth, 408\n\nU.S. at 577.\n\n             Of course, we recognize that there are situations in\n\nwhich the Ordinance might be enforced in such a way as to implicate\n\nthe legitimate, constitutionally protectable property rights of\n\naffected landlords and tenants.        The record in this case, however,\n\ndoes not contain any indication that such events have transpired.\n\nThough we conclude that, on the record before us, the appellants\n\nhave failed to show that enforcement of the Ordinance has resulted\n\nin   harm   to   a   cognizable   liberty   or     property    interest,     this\n\nconclusion does not preclude the possibility of a meritorious as-\n\napplied challenge premised on more fully developed facts.\n\n             The district court also considered whether the fact that\n\nstudents had been subjected to URI disciplinary procedures could\n\nserve as a \"plus\" factor.         URI Student Senate, 707 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n301-02.     It rejected that hypothesis.      Id. at 301.       The appellants\n\ndo not mount a credible challenge to this conclusion: although they\n\nnote in their briefs that students were referred to URI for\n\npossible discipline, they do not point specifically to these\n\nreferrals as a source of incremental harm.               Nor do they offer any\n\nexplanation as to how disciplinary referrals might constitute a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f\"plus\" factor.       Any argument to this effect is, therefore, waived.\n\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n             The appellants have one last arrow in this quiver.                They\n\ncomplain     that    the     Ordinance      prevents   them    from   living     in\n\nNarragansett.       That is codswallop pure and simple: the Ordinance\n\ndoes   not      prevent   anyone     from   living   anywhere.     Although     the\n\nOrdinance creates consequences for those who choose to reside in\n\nthe Town but fail to abide by the law, these consequences, whether\n\nviewed singly or collectively, do not constitute harm to any\n\ntangible interest enjoyed by the appellants.\n\n             Let us be perfectly clear.          We, like the district court,\n\nare uneasy about the absence of a hearing.                      In addition, we\n\nrecognize that there are potential applications of the Ordinance\n\nthat might impair constitutionally protected liberty or property\n\ninterests (say, if the police were to enforce the Ordinance in an\n\ninvidiously discriminatory way).             But the appellants have brought\n\na facial challenge, not an as-applied challenge, and the record is\n\nbarren     of     evidence    that     unconstitutional       applications     have\n\noccurred.        The mere possibility of misuse is insufficient to\n\ninvalidate an ordinance on a facial attack.             See Ohio v. Akron Ctr.\n\nfor Reprod. Health, 497 U.S. 502, 514 (1990).\n\n             To conclude, the appellants have failed to demonstrate,\n\nas would be required to sustain a facial challenge, that any of the\n\nincremental harms to which they point in the hope of satisfying the\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\frequirements of the stigma plus standard inevitably results from\n\nthe   Ordinance's      implementation.     We   therefore   reject   the\n\nappellants' procedural due process claim.\n\n            2.   Overbreadth.     The appellants complain that the\n\nOrdinance is overly broad.     The focal point of this plaint is their\n\nallegation that the Ordinance penalizes landlords and tenants\n\nmerely because of their association with a place or an event and,\n\nthus, trenches upon the First Amendment right of association.9\n\nLandlords and tenants, they say, are free to host social gatherings\n\nand invite such persons as they may wish.\n\n            We need not linger long over this asseveration.      \"[T]he\n\noverbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that\n\ninhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights if the impermissible\n\napplications of the law are substantial when 'judged in relation to\n\nthe statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\"       Chicago v. Morales, 527\n\nU.S. 41, 52 (1999) (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,\n\n615 (1973)).     Thus, \"[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth\n\n. . . of a law, a court's first task is to determine whether the\n\nenactment    reaches    a   substantial   amount   of   constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct.      If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge\n\nmust fail.\" Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,\n\n\n      9\n       The appellants also suggest that the \"right of landlord and\ntenant to contract . . . is infringed\" by the overbreadth of the\nOrdinance. The appellants, however, have offered no authority to\nsuggest that the right to contract is a recognized First Amendment\ninterest. Manifestly, it is not.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fInc., 455 U.S. 489, 494 (1982); accord Whiting v. Town of Westerly,\n\n942 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1991).     The Supreme Court has warned that\n\n\"[t]he overbreadth doctrine is 'strong medicine' that is used\n\n'sparingly and only as a last resort.'\"        N.Y. State Club Ass'n v.\n\nCity of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 14 (1988) (quoting Broadrick, 413\n\nU.S. at 613); see also McCullen v. Coakley, 571 F.3d 167, 182 (1st\n\nCir. 2009); New Engl. Accessories Trade Ass'n v. City of Nashua,\n\n679 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           The appellants' overbreadth argument misses the mark.\n\nThe constitutionally protected right of association cannot be\n\nreinvented to suit a plaintiff's fancy. It has never been expanded\n\nto include purely social gatherings.         Rather, it is contingent on\n\nthe   presence   of   underlying   individual      rights    of    expression\n\nprotected by the First Amendment.         See Wine & Spirits Retailers,\n\nInc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, 50 (1st Cir. 2005).                 As we\n\nexplain below, there is no such underlying right at stake here.\n\n           The   Court   has   identified    two   types    of    \"freedom   of\n\nassociation\" that merit constitutional protection: (i) \"choices to\n\nenter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships\" and\n\n(ii) association \"for the purpose of engaging in those activities\n\nprotected by the First Amendment.\"          Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468\n\nU.S. 609, 617-18 (1984).       These categories cannot be stretched to\n\nform a generic right to mix and mingle. City of Dallas v. Stanglin,\n\n490 U.S. 19, 24 (1989) (concluding that ordinance restricting\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fattendance at dance halls did not reach the kind of \"expressive\n\nassociation that the First Amendment has been held to protect\").\n\nIn the teeth of these authorities, the appellants urge us to\n\nsanctify a generalized \"right to congregate and socialize.\" This\n\nfree-wheeling right far outstrips the bounds of recognized First\n\nAmendment protections.\n\n           In the case at hand, we have construed the Ordinance as\n\nrequiring that the prosecution prove that an offending gathering\n\ncreated not only a substantial disturbance but also one involving\n\na   violation   of   law.   See   infra   Part   II(B)(3).    Mere   police\n\nintervention is not enough. See id. In light of this construction,\n\nwe conclude that the Ordinance does not reach \"a substantial amount\n\nof constitutionally protected conduct.\"          Vill. of Hoffman Estates,\n\n455 U.S. at 494.\n\n           The concern that the Ordinance, if applied in certain\n\ninstances, could infringe upon constitutionally protected rights\n\n(by, say, being invoked to interfere with a political gathering or\n\nto disband a prayer meeting) may be valid in the abstract.           But we\n\ndo not deal here in abstractions, and the appellants have neither\n\npressed nor adduced evidence to support an as-applied challenge.\n\nMore is needed to sustain a facial overbreadth challenge.               Cf.\n\nMorales, 527 U.S. at 52-53 (declining to invalidate ordinance on\n\nfacial overbreadth grounds because it prohibited neither speech nor\n\nany form of expressive conduct).\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f          3.     Vagueness.     Finally, the appellants maintain that\n\nsection 46-31 of the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.      They\n\nbemoan the Ordinance's use of undefined terms such as \"substantial\n\ndisturbance,\" \"public nuisance,\" and \"a significant segment of a\n\nneighborhood.\"     These terms, the appellants theorize, do not\n\nprovide landlords, tenants, or other persons fair notice as to what\n\nbehavior is proscribed.       Furthermore, the phrases fail to provide\n\nobjective standards under which those charged with enforcing the\n\nOrdinance can do so even-handedly.\n\n          \"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment\n\nis void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\"\n\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).      A law that\n\nsurvives an overbreadth challenge because it does not reach a\n\nsubstantial amount of conduct protected by the First Amendment may\n\nstill be vulnerable to a facial vagueness challenge under the Due\n\nProcess Clause.     Whiting, 942 F.2d at 22.       \"For such a facial\n\nchallenge to succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate\n\nthat the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\"\n\nId.; see Donovan v. City of Haverhill, 311 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"To prevail in a facial challenge to an ordinance that does\n\nnot regulate constitutionally protected conduct, plaintiffs must\n\nsurmount a dauntingly high hurdle.\") (citing Vill. of Hoffman\n\nEstates, 455 U.S. at 498-99).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f             To comport with the strictures of due process, a law must\n\ndefine an offense \"'[1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary\n\npeople can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a\n\nmanner   that   does       not   encourage       arbitrary    and   discriminatory\n\nenforcement.'        The    void-for-vagueness        doctrine      embraces   these\n\nrequirements.\" Skilling v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 2896, 2927-28\n\n(2010) (quoting Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983)); see\n\nalso United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008); Morales,\n\n527 U.S. at 56; McCullen, 571 F.3d at 182-83.                 Nevertheless, words\n\nare    rough-hewn     tools,       not     surgically     precise       instruments.\n\nConsequently,       some    degree    of    inexactitude       is   acceptable    in\n\nstatutory language.         See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110 (acknowledging\n\nthat   one   \"can    never       expect    mathematical      certainty     from   our\n\nlanguage\"). Consistent with this reality, \"the fact that a statute\n\nrequires     some    interpretation         does    not      perforce    render   it\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\" IMS Health Inc. v. Ayotte, 550 F.3d 42,\n\n61 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Barr v. Galvin, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2010) [No. 09-2426, slip op. at 16].                        It follows that\n\n\"reasonable breadth\" in the terms employed by an ordinance does not\n\nrequire that it be invalidated on vagueness grounds.                    Grayned, 408\n\nU.S. at 110.\n\n             We are convinced that the Ordinance is sufficiently clear\n\nto survive the appellants' vagueness challenge.                      Words such as\n\n\"substantial\" and \"significant,\" if read in a vacuum, might be\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fproblematic.       Cf. Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston, 652\n\nF.2d 1115, 1119, 1123-24 (1st Cir. 1981) (finding impermissibly\n\nvague provision allowing denial of license where granting it would\n\n\"otherwise       significantly       harm[]       the    legitimate      protectable\n\ninterests of the affected citizens of the city\" (alteration in\n\noriginal)). Here, however, the challenged phrases do not appear in\n\na vacuum.        The Ordinance contains additional terms that supply\n\nconcrete guidance as to the behavior that it prohibits and the\n\ncircumstances in which it can be enforced.\n\n            Perhaps most important, section 46-31 authorizes police\n\nintervention      only    in   the   event     that     \"conduct    constituting     a\n\nviolation of law\" occurs. The prerequisite \"violation of law\" must\n\npertain to some law other than the Ordinance itself.                     In our view,\n\nthe requirement that a violation of law be committed as a condition\n\nprecedent to police intervention provides adequate guidance to\n\nensure    that    the    Ordinance    is    not    arbitrarily     enforced.       See\n\nGrayned, 408 U.S. at 112 (noting that existence of particularized\n\nenforcement context may undercut claim of vagueness).\n\n            Our     conclusion       that    the    Ordinance      withstands      the\n\nappellants' assault is reinforced by other considerations.                     First,\n\nsubsection 46-31(a) furnishes a non-exhaustive list of predicate\n\noffenses that will allow a police officer to enforce the Ordinance.\n\nThe existence of clear examples of conduct covered by a law may, in\n\ncertain    circumstances,       help    to    insulate     the     law   against   an\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\faccusation of vagueness.    See, e.g., Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733,\n\n754 (1974).\n\n           Second, we are privy to a straightforward articulation of\n\nthe Town's purpose in adopting the Ordinance. This clear statement\n\nhelps to dispel any uncertainty.\n\n           The Supreme Court has looked to an ordinance's preamble\n\nto ascertain what activity it was intended to prohibit.               See\n\nGrayned, 408 U.S. at 110-11; see also IMS Health, 550 F.3d at 62\n\n(noting that, in adjudicating a facial vagueness challenge, \"the\n\nstate's articulated purpose narrows the interpretive lens through\n\nwhich we must view the problem\").        The preamble to the original\n\nversion   of   the   Ordinance   explains   that   \"due   to   inadequate\n\nsupervision, some large gatherings of people . . . frequently\n\nbecome loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat\n\nto the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public.\"\n\nIt goes on to explain that the Town is required to respond over and\n\nover to such gatherings \"to restore and maintain the peace and\n\nprotect public safety\" and that such repetitive responses unduly\n\nburden municipal resources. It is thus apparent that the Ordinance\n\nis aimed at \"discourag[ing] the occurrence of repeated loud and\n\nunruly gatherings.\" We think that this plainly articulated purpose\n\nis a significant contextual clue.        In this instance, it helps to\n\ninform the meaning of the contested language.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f           In the interest of clarity, we note that we read the\n\nOrdinance to require that, in order to impose liability under\n\nsections   46-34    and    46-35,   the      prosecution   most   prove    that   a\n\ngathering creating a substantial disturbance involving a violation\n\nof law occurred both at the time of the initial posting and when\n\nthe subsequent intervention took place.               Police intervention at a\n\nresidence is not enough, by itself, to establish an Ordinance\n\nviolation. Thus, the penalties prescribed by the Ordinance — fines\n\nand community service — cannot flow merely from a police officer's\n\ndecision to intervene at a gathering.\n\n           The bottom line is that, viewed in context, it is clear\n\nwhat conduct the Ordinance as a whole forbids. Taken together, the\n\nrequirement that someone at a gathering must have committed a\n\npredicate offense, the list of examples of violations of law that\n\nmight serve as such a predicate to police intervention included in\n\nthe Ordinance, and the Town's articulated concern about quality-of-\n\nlife issues provide sufficient enforcement guidance to police and\n\nadequately      define    the    type   of     behaviors   prohibited      by   the\n\nOrdinance.      One can envision many permissible applications of the\n\nOrdinance.      No more is exigible to ward off a facial challenge\n\npremised   on    vagueness      grounds.       See,   e.g.,   Vill.   of   Hoffman\n\nEstates, 455 U.S. at 497; Whiting, 942 F.2d at 22.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fIII.

Jefferson Melish, for appellants.</p>\n<p>Marc DeSisto, with whom Mark A. McSally, Town Solicitor, Kelly, Kelleher, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Reilly &amp; Simpson, and DeSisto Law were on brief, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The town of Narragansett (the Town), a sleepy seaside community in southern Rhode Island, boasts some of the most beautiful beaches on the eastern seaboard. Each summer, the Town experiences a substantial influx of seasonal residents. Each fall, the Town empties out, leaving a large number of dwellings unoccupied. The Town's proximity to the University of Rhode Island (URI) makes these dwellings attractive for student housing.</p>\n<p>This thriving rental market among college students has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, the clamor for student housing is an economic boon to property owners willing to rent their dwellings. On the other hand, the sheer mass of exuberant young people and their predilections have proven to be a threat to the quality of life in a quiet enclave.</p>\n<p>In an effort to balance these competing concerns, the Town adopted a novel ordinance authorizing local police officers to post a bright orange sticker at the front entrance of any residence found to have hosted an \"unruly gathering.\" The ordinance has had its detractors, and this case was brought as a multifaceted challenge to it. The challengers complain that the ordinance is both preempted by state law and unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>The district court, in a thoughtful and comprehensive rescript, rejected these plaints. <i>See </i><i>URI Student Senate v. Town of Narragansett,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d 282 (D.R.I.2010). After careful consideration, we find that the Town's unorthodox solution to the problems caused by unruly gatherings does not, on its face, offend either state law or the United States Constitution. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We first recount the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the ordinance and summarize its terms. We then limn the travel of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Ordinance.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Narragansett Town Council initially adopted an \"unruly gatherings\" ordinance in 2005. It amended that ordinance in 2007. The amended version (the Ordinance), codified at chapter 46, article II, of the Town's Code of Ordinances, remains in force. We refer throughout to that version, which is reprinted in the appendix.</p>\n<p>Section 46-31 of the Ordinance empowers local police officers to intervene at and disperse gatherings that are sparking \"a substantial disturbance.\" The police may only do so, however, when the disturbance involves \"a violation of law.\" Subsection (a) provides an illustrative list of instances of unlawful conduct that might constitute such a violation (e.g., excessive noise, obstruction of public streets, illegal parking, public drunkenness or urination, service of alcohol to minors).</p>\n<p>Once the police have abated and dispersed an unruly gathering, subsection 46-32(a) authorizes them to prominently post a notice on the premises. This notice takes the form of a bright orange ten-by-fourteen-inch sticker, which is affixed on or near the front entrance of the building.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> The sticker contains an explicit message. It admonishes that, should police intervention be required in response to another violation at the same address during the same posting period, various parties (e.g., the owners and residents of the premises, the sponsors of the unruly gathering, and any guests who cause a nuisance) will be held jointly and severally liable. Landlords are informed by mail of both the posting and the violation that led to it.</p>\n<p>The Ordinance makes explicit allowance for certain defenses to prosecution for a subsequent violation. For example, under subsection 46-34(a)(5), a showing that only uninvited participants engaged in the proscribed conduct serves as a defense for innocent landlords, tenants, or event sponsors. To assert this defense, a landlord, tenant, or sponsor must show that she took \"all steps reasonably necessary to exclude\" the responsible individuals. As to landlords, such exclusionary actions include \"actively attempting\" to evict boisterous tenants.</p>\n<p>The posting periods prescribed by subsection 46-32(a) correspond with the economic realities of the seasonal housing cycle. If a building is posted between the beginning of September and the end of May, the sticker must remain in place until May 31. If a building is posted between the beginning of June and the end of August, the sticker must remain in place until August 31.</p>\n<p>Under subsection 46-32(b), landlords and tenants are jointly responsible for maintaining the notice in place. If a landlord or tenant removes the sticker, abets its removal, or tampers with it during the posting period, she is subject to a fine.</p>\n<p>Section 46-35 delineates the penalties associated with infractions at previously posted dwellings. Under subsection (a), the first post-posting intervention during a given posting period incurs a $300 fine; the second, a $400 fine; and any further intervention, a $500 fine. Under subsection (b), violators may be required to perform community service or, for repeat offenders, community service is mandatory.</p>\n<p>The Town routinely compiles statistics relating to its enforcement of the Ordinance. Its roster of offending dwellings includes all addresses at which police officers have intervened to abate and disperse unruly gatherings. It also maintains a list that features data relating to Ordinance violations committed by URI students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In May of 2008, the appellants challenged the Ordinance in a Rhode Island court. The defendants removed the case to the district court in pursuance of federal question jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.</p>\n<p>The lead plaintiff-appellant is the URI Student Senate, which claims to represent the interests of URI students generally. The remaining plaintiffs, also appellants here, can be sorted into three categories. The first group comprises individual URI students who reside in Narragansett and have felt the sting of the Ordinance. These appellants claim, among other things, that they have been subjected to university disciplinary procedures as a result of violating the Ordinance.<sup>[2]</sup> The second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> group consists of URI students whose rented abodes have been posted with orange stickers. These appellants claim that they were evicted from their homes and referred to the URI Student Life Office as a result. The last group comprises landlords who have had their rental properties posted. These appellants claim that they have been unable to re-rent their properties and, consequently, have lost rental income. The defendants, appellees here, are the Town and a galaxy of municipal officials. For ease in exposition, we refer to the Town as if it were the sole defendant.</p>\n<p>The complaint is cast mostly, but not entirely, as a series of constitutional challenges. The exception is a preemption claim positing that the Ordinance is preempted by a state statute. The constitutional claims allege variously that the Ordinance (i) violates substantive due process, (ii) is unconstitutionally vague, (iii) is overbroad, (iv) offends the requirements of procedural due process, and (v) deprives the appellants of equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p>In due season, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts. The district court denied the appellants' motion and granted the cross-motion. <i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 304. The court expressed concern about the absence of any pre-posting opportunity to challenge the orange stickers, <i>id.</i> at 296, 302, but nonetheless upheld the Ordinance. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We begin our analysis with the preemption claim and then move to the constitutional claims. Before undertaking this exegesis, we pause to memorialize the standard of review.</p>\n<p>We review an appeal from the entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Osediacz v. City of Cranston,</i> 414 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir.2005). In so doing, we take the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving party. <i>Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v. Serrano-Isern,</i> 605 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010). \"We will affirm only if the record reveals `no genuine issue as to any material fact' and `the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\" <i>Vineberg v. Bissonnette,</i> 548 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Preemption.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants assert that the Ordinance is preempted by the Rhode Island Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (L &amp; T Act), R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-18-1 to 34-18-57. As its title implies, the L &amp; T Act speaks to the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants within Rhode Island. <i>See id.</i> §§ 34-18-2, 34-18-7. In advocating preemption, the appellants rely on section 34-18-36, which gives most tenants the right to cure any material breach of a rental agreement prior to eviction.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under Rhode Island law, a municipal ordinance may be preempted by a state statutory scheme either if the ordinance conflicts with the statutory scheme or if it can be shown that the General Assembly intended its statutory scheme to occupy the whole of the regulatory field in connection with a given subject. <i>Amico's Inc. v. Mattos,</i> 789 A.2d 899, 907 (R.I. 2002); <i>Town of Warren v. Thornton-Whitehouse,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> 740 A.2d 1255, 1261 (R.I. 1999). The appellants' preemption argument rests on the first of these lines of attack: the supposed existence of a conflict between the Ordinance and the L &amp; T Act.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The appellants contend that the Ordinance conflicts with section 34-18-36 of the L &amp; T Act because it \"requires\" a landlord to evict an offending tenant without providing the tenant with an opportunity to cure. Eviction is required, the appellants say, so that the landlord can avoid liability for subsequent Ordinance violations at posted properties.</p>\n<p>This argument represents a triumph of hope over reason. The Ordinance does not <i>require</i> a landlord to initiate eviction proceedings against an offending tenant. Rather, section 46-34(a)(5) explains that the owner of a previously posted property may avoid liability for a subsequent unruly gathering at that location as long as the owner is \"actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.\" Affording the landlord an \"ongoing eviction\" defense is not tantamount, either legally or practically, to compelling him to institute eviction proceedings.</p>\n<p>The appellants try to dodge this bullet. They note that, under the L &amp; T Act, the first step in evicting a tenant is the issuance of a noncompliance notice. R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36. The appellants declare that this provision grounds a preemption claim because sending a notice of noncompliance is antithetic to an active attempt at eviction.</p>\n<p>This ipse dixit is not accompanied by any explanation as to why or how the transmittal of a notice of noncompliance interferes with, let alone negates, the active pursuit of eviction. Bearing in mind that sending such a notice is the first step in the eviction pavane, the two acts seem entirely compatible. Certainly, there is nothing in either the text of the Ordinance or the letter of the L &amp; T Act that precludes simultaneous compliance with both.</p>\n<p>In all events, conflict preemption requires a direct conflict or something very close to it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,</i> 514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S.Ct. 1483, 131 L.Ed.2d 385 (1995) (explaining that implied conflict preemption may exist where it is \"impossible for a . . . party to comply with both . . . requirements\" or where a provision \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\" of the legislature (quotations omitted)). An awkward fit, without more, will not support a claim of conflict preemption.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, we are unable to discern either a direct conflict or an irreconcilable inconsistency between the provisions of the Ordinance and the provisions of the L &amp; T Act. We therefore hold, without serious question, that the L &amp; T Act does not preempt the Ordinance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Constitutional Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants advance a compendium of constitutional challenges to the Ordinance. Because they have not pressed either their generalized substantive due process or equal protection claims, we eschew any further discussion of those initiatives. Without exception, what remains are facial challenges.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> 1. Procedural Due Process. We start with the contention that the Ordinance deprives both landlords and tenants of procedural due process. The appellants pounce on the fact that the Ordinance allows the police to plaster an orange sticker on a dwelling without affording either the landlord or the tenants any opportunity for a hearing.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>It is familiar lore that the essence of procedural due process is prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). But this principle does not operate in a vacuum. In order to show a deprivation of procedural due process, a party must first show that the challenged action implicates a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. <i>Id.</i> at 569-70, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <i>Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of HUD,</i> 421 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.</p>\n<p>In an effort to cross this threshold, the appellants focus on reputational harm, that is, the allegedly stigmatizing effects of the Ordinance. They say that when a residence is posted with an orange sticker, both the landlord and the tenants are publicly branded as criminals. They add that this stigma is heightened by the Town's action in keeping a publicly available register of all posted premises.</p>\n<p>Student tenants are alleged to suffer a further detriment. When an orange sticker is posted on premises occupied by a university student, the Town informs URI. In the appellants' view, this additional step exposes student tenants to disciplinary proceedings and exacerbates the stigmatizing effect of the postings.</p>\n<p>This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. In constitutional jurisprudence, stigmatization is a term of art. The Supreme Court has made clear that a procedural due process claim cannot rest upon reputational harm alone. <i>Paul v. Davis,</i> 424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). Thus, when a person alleges that she has suffered stigmatization at the hands of a government actor, she must show an adverse effect on some interest \"more tangible\" than reputational harm. <i>Id.</i> To use the popular catch phrase, the complaining party must satisfy a \"stigma plus\" standard. <i>Pendleton v. City of Haverhill,</i> 156 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The \"plus\" part of this formulation is not an empty formality. In determining whether there exists a cognizable harm, the stigma plus standard requires us to address two distinct components: (i) the nature of the incremental harm to which the appellants point and (ii) the source of that harm.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> A party who claims a violation of her procedural due process rights based on reputational harm must show that the challenged governmental action adversely impacted some right or status previously enjoyed by her under substantive state or federal law. <i>See </i><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155; <i>Silva v. Worden,</i> 130 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.1997). For this purpose, harm to a right or status that does not emanate from substantive state or federal law is insufficient. Such harm thus does not qualify as harm to a more tangible interest within the purview of the stigma plus standard. <i>See </i><i>Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p>The nature of the affected interest is not the only hurdle that a complaining party must overcome in order to satisfy the stigma plus standard. The standard requires that the change in rights or status be directly attributable to the challenged governmental action. <i>Id.</i> Where the stigma and the incremental harmthe \"plus\" factorderive from distinct sources, a party cannot make out a viable procedural due process claim. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hawkins v. R.I. Lottery Comm'n,</i> 238 F.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir.2001). That is true even if both sources are government entities. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellants acknowledge that a showing beyond purely reputational harm is required by the stigma plus standard. To meet that requirement, they describe two injuries that they claim result from the postings.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>First, the appellants aver that the L &amp; T Act provides them with rights \"to housing, to cure breaches, to notice, [and] to possession.\" Second, they tout the \"right to rent and live in Narragansett free of public branding.\" These rights, they insist, implicate protected liberty and property interests, and the infringement of them suffices to trigger the stigma plus standard.</p>\n<p>There is, however, no cognizable harm. The appellants say that some landlords have been unable to re-rent posted dwellings. Taking this as true, the resulting loss of rent is not a viable \"plus\" factor. Nothing in the L &amp; T Act (or elsewhere in state law, for that matter) confers on landlords an entitlement to have rental units fully occupied. Rather, the L &amp; T Act for the most part leaves the negotiation of leases and rates to the marketplacethat is, to the landlord and each prospective tenant. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-15(a). This framework plainly contemplates that rental income is contingent on the availability of willing renters. Viewed against this backdrop, it cannot seriously be suggested that state law creates an entitlement to a steady stream of rental income that would qualify as a \"more tangible\" interest (and, thus, as a \"plus\" factor).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the vacancies that the appellants lament do not result from state action but, rather, from the actions of third parties. After all, it is prospective tenants, acting without government compulsion, who decide whether or not to rent particular dwellings. A prospective tenant can base her decision not to rent on a multitude of factors including cost, location, amenities, and condition. There is nothing that prevents her, <i>as a private party,</i> from weighing in this balance the presence of an orange sticker. These third-party decisions are not attributable to state action in the requisite sense. <i>See </i><i>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,</i> 457 U.S. 922, 937-39, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) (describing circumstances in which private party's actions may be considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> \"fairly attributable\" to the state); <i>Logiodice v. Trs. of Me. Cent. Inst.,</i> 296 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (similar). When a specified harm is predicated on voluntary third-party behavior, it cannot serve as a \"plus\" factor. <i>Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p>The student tenants' proposed \"plus\" factor is no more robust. This claim relies on evictions as a source of harm. It suggests that a tenant has a right to peaceable enjoyment of a rented dwelling free from eviction and that, therefore, eviction represents a cognizable \"plus\" factor. This is too sanguine a view.</p>\n<p>The student tenants' claim is defeated by the fact that their residential rights derive primarily from private contracts (leases) between private parties (landlords and tenants), which entail private obligations. The L &amp; T Act does not itself create a right to tenancies of any particular duration. In the last analysis, it is the lease terms (and the tenant's compliance with them) that generally determine the tenant's right to remain in a rented dwelling.<sup>[8]</sup> That is dispositive because a constitutionally protected property interest must rest on a right or status conferred by state law, not merely on the complaining party's unilateral expectations. <i>See </i><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-11, 96 S.Ct. 1155; <i>Roth,</i> 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p>Of course, we recognize that there are situations in which the Ordinance might be enforced in such a way as to implicate the legitimate, constitutionally protectable property rights of affected landlords and tenants. The record in this case, however, does not contain any indication that such events have transpired. Though we conclude that, on the record before us, the appellants have failed to show that enforcement of the Ordinance has resulted in harm to a cognizable liberty or property interest, this conclusion does not preclude the possibility of a meritorious as-applied challenge premised on more fully developed facts.</p>\n<p>The district court also considered whether the fact that students had been subjected to URI disciplinary procedures could serve as a \"plus\" factor. <i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 301-02. It rejected that hypothesis. <i>Id.</i> at 301. The appellants do not mount a credible challenge to this conclusion: although they note in their briefs that students were referred to URI for possible discipline, they do not point specifically to these referrals as a source of incremental harm. Nor do they offer any explanation as to how disciplinary referrals might constitute a \"plus\" factor. Any argument to this effect is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The appellants have one last arrow in this quiver. They complain that the Ordinance prevents them from living in Narragansett. That is codswallop pure and simple: the Ordinance does not prevent anyone from living anywhere. Although the Ordinance creates consequences for those who choose to reside in the Town but fail to abide by the law, these consequences, whether viewed singly or collectively, do not constitute harm to any tangible interest enjoyed by the appellants.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We, like the district court, are uneasy about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> the absence of a hearing. In addition, we recognize that there are potential applications of the Ordinance that might impair constitutionally protected liberty or property interests (say, if the police were to enforce the Ordinance in an invidiously discriminatory way). But the appellants have brought a facial challenge, not an as-applied challenge, and the record is barren of evidence that unconstitutional applications have occurred. The mere possibility of misuse is insufficient to invalidate an ordinance on a facial attack. <i>See </i><i>Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health,</i> 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990).</p>\n<p>To conclude, the appellants have failed to demonstrate, as would be required to sustain a facial challenge, that any of the incremental harms to which they point in the hope of satisfying the requirements of the stigma plus standard inevitably results from the Ordinance's implementation. We therefore reject the appellants' procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Overbreadth.</i> The appellants complain that the Ordinance is overly broad. The focal point of this plaint is their allegation that the Ordinance penalizes landlords and tenants merely because of their association with a place or an event and, thus, trenches upon the First Amendment right of association.<sup>[9]</sup> Landlords and tenants, they say, are free to host social gatherings and invite such persons as they may wish.</p>\n<p>We need not linger long over this asseveration. \"[T]he overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when `judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>Chicago v. Morales,</i> 527 U.S. 41, 52, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (quoting <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). Thus, \"[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth . . . of a law, a court's first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail.\" <i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982); <i>accord </i><i>Whiting v. Town of Westerly,</i> 942 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1991). The Supreme Court has warned that \"[t]he overbreadth doctrine is `strong medicine' that is used `sparingly and only as a last resort.'\" <i>N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 14, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (quoting <i>Broadrick,</i> 413 U.S. at 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908); <i>see also </i><i>McCullen v. Coakley,</i> 571 F.3d 167, 182 (1st Cir.2009); <i>New Engl. Accessories Trade Ass'n v. City of Nashua,</i> 679 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>The appellants' overbreadth argument misses the mark. The constitutionally protected right of association cannot be reinvented to suit a plaintiff's fancy. It has never been expanded to include purely social gatherings. Rather, it is contingent on the presence of underlying individual rights of expression protected by the First Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,</i> 418 F.3d 36, 50 (1st Cir.2005). As we explain below, there is no such underlying right at stake here.</p>\n<p>The Court has identified two types of \"freedom of association\" that merit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> constitutional protection: (i) \"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships\" and (ii) association \"for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment.\" <i>Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees,</i> 468 U.S. 609, 617-18, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). These categories cannot be stretched to form a generic right to mix and mingle. <i>City of Dallas v. Stanglin,</i> 490 U.S. 19, 24, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989) (concluding that ordinance restricting attendance at dance halls did not reach the kind of \"expressive association that the First Amendment has been held to protect\"). In the teeth of these authorities, the appellants urge us to sanctify a generalized \"right to congregate and socialize.\" This free-wheeling right far outstrips the bounds of recognized First Amendment protections.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, we have construed the Ordinance as requiring that the prosecution prove that an offending gathering created not only a substantial disturbance but also one involving a violation of law. <i>See infra</i> Part II(B)(3). Mere police intervention is not enough. <i>See id.</i> In light of this construction, we conclude that the Ordinance does not reach \"a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\" <i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates,</i> 455 U.S. at 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186.</p>\n<p>The concern that the Ordinance, if applied in certain instances, could infringe upon constitutionally protected rights (by, say, being invoked to interfere with a political gathering or to disband a prayer meeting) may be valid in the abstract. But we do not deal here in abstractions, and the appellants have neither pressed nor adduced evidence to support an as-applied challenge. More is needed to sustain a facial overbreadth challenge. <i>Cf. </i><i>Morales,</i> 527 U.S. at 52-53, 119 S.Ct. 1849 (declining to invalidate ordinance on facial overbreadth grounds because it prohibited neither speech nor any form of expressive conduct).</p>\n<p>3. <i>Vagueness.</i> Finally, the appellants maintain that section 46-31 of the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. They bemoan the Ordinance's use of undefined terms such as \"substantial disturbance,\" \"public nuisance,\" and \"a significant segment of a neighborhood.\" These terms, the appellants theorize, do not provide landlords, tenants, or other persons fair notice as to what behavior is proscribed. Furthermore, the phrases fail to provide objective standards under which those charged with enforcing the Ordinance can do so even-handedly.</p>\n<p>\"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\" <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). A law that survives an overbreadth challenge because it does not reach a substantial amount of conduct protected by the First Amendment may still be vulnerable to a facial vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause. <i>Whiting,</i> 942 F.2d at 22. \"For such a facial challenge to succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\" <i>Id.; see </i><i>Donovan v. City of Haverhill,</i> 311 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.2002) (\"To prevail in a facial challenge to an ordinance that does not regulate constitutionally protected conduct, plaintiffs must surmount a dauntingly high hurdle.\") (citing <i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates,</i> 455 U.S. at 498-99, 102 S.Ct. 1186).</p>\n<p>To comport with the strictures of due process, a law must define an offense \"`[1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.' The void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these requirements.\" <i>Skilling v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2927-28, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010) (quoting <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> 553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008); <i>Morales,</i> 527 U.S. at 56, 119 S.Ct. 1849; <i>McCullen,</i> 571 F.3d at 182-83. Nevertheless, words are rough-hewn tools, not surgically precise instruments. Consequently, some degree of inexactitude is acceptable in statutory language. <i>See </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294 (acknowledging that one \"can never expect mathematical certainty from our language\"). Consistent with this reality, \"the fact that a statute requires some interpretation does not perforce render it unconstitutionally vague.\" <i>IMS Health Inc. v. Ayotte,</i> 550 F.3d 42, 61 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Barr v. Galvin,</i> 626 F.3d 99, 107 (1st Cir.2010). It follows that \"reasonable breadth\" in the terms employed by an ordinance does not require that it be invalidated on vagueness grounds. <i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294.</p>\n<p>We are convinced that the Ordinance is sufficiently clear to survive the appellants' vagueness challenge. Words such as \"substantial\" and \"significant,\" if read in a vacuum, might be problematic. <i>Cf. </i><i>Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston,</i> 652 F.2d 1115, 1119, 1123-24 (1st Cir.1981) (finding impermissibly vague provision allowing denial of license where granting it would \"otherwise significantly harm[] the legitimate protectable interests of the affected citizens of the city\" (alteration in original)). Here, however, the challenged phrases do not appear in a vacuum. The Ordinance contains additional terms that supply concrete guidance as to the behavior that it prohibits and the circumstances in which it can be enforced.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most important, section 46-31 authorizes police intervention only in the event that \"conduct constituting a violation of law\" occurs. The prerequisite \"violation of law\" must pertain to some law other than the Ordinance itself. In our view, the requirement that a violation of law be committed as a condition precedent to police intervention provides adequate guidance to ensure that the Ordinance is not arbitrarily enforced. <i>See </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 112, 92 S.Ct. 2294 (noting that existence of particularized enforcement context may undercut claim of vagueness).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the Ordinance withstands the appellants' assault is reinforced by other considerations. First, subsection 46-31(a) furnishes a non-exhaustive list of predicate offenses that will allow a police officer to enforce the Ordinance. The existence of clear examples of conduct covered by a law may, in certain circumstances, help to insulate the law against an accusation of vagueness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974).</p>\n<p>Second, we are privy to a straightforward articulation of the Town's purpose in adopting the Ordinance. This clear statement helps to dispel any uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has looked to an ordinance's preamble to ascertain what activity it was intended to prohibit. <i>See </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 110-11, 92 S.Ct. 2294; <i>see also </i><i>IMS Health,</i> 550 F.3d at 62 (noting that, in adjudicating a facial vagueness challenge, \"the state's articulated purpose narrows the interpretive lens through which we must view the problem\"). The preamble to the original version of the Ordinance explains that \"due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people. . . frequently become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public.\" It goes on to explain that the Town is required to respond over and over to such gatherings \"to restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety\" and that such repetitive responses unduly burden municipal resources. It is thus apparent that the Ordinance is aimed at \"discourag[ing] the occurrence of repeated loud and unruly gatherings.\" We think that this plainly articulated purpose is a significant contextual clue. In this instance, it helps to inform the meaning of the contested language.</p>\n<p>In the interest of clarity, we note that we read the Ordinance to require that, in order to impose liability under sections 46-34 and 46-35, the prosecution most prove that a gathering creating a substantial disturbance involving a violation of law occurred both at the time of the initial posting and when the subsequent intervention took place. Police intervention at a residence is not enough, by itself, to establish an Ordinance violation. Thus, the penalties prescribed by the Ordinancefines and community servicecannot flow merely from a police officer's decision to intervene at a gathering.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that, viewed in context, it is clear what conduct the Ordinance as a whole forbids. Taken together, the requirement that someone at a gathering must have committed a predicate offense, the list of examples of violations of law that might serve as such a predicate to police intervention included in the Ordinance, and the Town's articulated concern about quality-of-life issues provide sufficient enforcement guidance to police and adequately define the type of behaviors prohibited by the Ordinance. One can envision many permissible applications of the Ordinance. No more is exigible to ward off a facial challenge premised on vagueness grounds. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates,</i> 455 U.S. at 497, 102 S.Ct. 1186; <i>Whiting,</i> 942 F.2d at 22.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons articulated above, we uphold the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>Appendix</i><sup>[10]</sup></h2>\n<p>The current version of the Ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-31. Public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) It shall be a public nuisance to conduct a gathering of five or more persons on any private property in a manner which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a significant segment of a neighborhood, as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law. Illustrative of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic, obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, illegal parking, public drunkenness, public urination, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, and litter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A gathering constituting a public nuisance may be abated by all reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order requiring the gathering to be disbanded and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under any applicable ordinances and state statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-32. Notice of unruly gathering; posting, mailing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> (a) When the police department intervenes at a gathering which constitutes a nuisance under this article, the premises at which such nuisance occurred shall be posted with a notice stating that the intervention of the police has been necessitated as a result of a public nuisance under this article caused by an event at the premises, the date of the police intervention, and that any subsequent event within the period set forth below on the same premises, which necessitates police intervention, shall result in the joint and several liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, or any persons who own or are residents of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, or who sponsored the event constituting the public nuisance as more fully set forth below. Any notice posted between September 1 and May 31 of any year shall remain posted until May 31. Any notice posted between June 1 and August 31 of any year shall remain posted until August 31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) The residents and owner of such property shall be jointly responsible for ensuring that such notice is not removed or defaced and it shall be a Code violation carrying a penalty of a minimum, mandatory $100.00 fine in addition to any other penalties which may be due under this section if such notice is removed, obscured or defaced, provided, however, that the residents of the premises or sponsor of the event, if present, shall be consulted as to the location in which such notice is posted in order to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-33. Mailing of notice to property owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Notice of the intervention shall also be mailed to any property owner on the Town of Narragansett property tax assessment records and shall advise the property owner that any subsequent such intervention within posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a) on the same premises shall result in liability of the property owner for all penalties associated with such intervention as more particularly set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-34. Persons liable for subsequent response to gathering constituting a public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) If the police department is required to respond to a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the premises more than once in any posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a), the following persons shall be jointly and severally liable for fines as set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The person or persons who own the property where the gathering constituting the public nuisance took place, provided that notice has been mailed to the owner of the property as set forth herein and the gathering occurs at least two weeks after the mailing of such notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the property where such gathering took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) All persons attending such gatherings who engage in any activity resulting in the public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises, including landlords who are actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> (b) Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-35. Penalties for violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) It shall be a Code violation punishable as set forth herein when intervention at the same location to abate a gathering constituting a public nuisance occurs within any posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a) after the property was posted in accordance with section 46-11:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) For the first intervention in a posting period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $300.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) For the second such intervention in a posting period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $400.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) For any further such responses in a posting day period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) In addition to the above, the municipal court shall be authorized to order the person or persons in violation to perform community service. For a first intervention ordering community service shall be discretionary. For a second or third intervention, the municipal court shall, in addition to the monetary penalty set forth above, order the person or persons in violation to perform not less than 25 hours of community service for a second intervention and not less than 50 hours of community service for a third intervention.</blockquote>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record does not explain why the color orange was selected. Thus, like Nathaniel Hawthorne reflecting on a similar conundrum, one wonders if there is \"some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to [one's] sensibilities, but evading the analysis of [one's] mind.\" Nathaniel Hawthorne, <i>The Scarlet Letter,</i> intro. (1850). In the end, however, the choice of hue, though perplexing, is not relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  Criminal prosecution of those individuals for subsequent violations was underway in municipal court prior to the commencement of this suit. These proceedings have been held in abeyance.</p>\n<p>[3]  The L &amp; T Act makes separate provisions for what it calls \"seasonal\" tenants. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36(f). The case at hand does not turn on any such distinction and, thus, we refer to tenants generally.</p>\n<p>[4]  In their opening brief, the appellants make a passing reference to section 34-18-7 as a possible source of field preemption. This reference is not developed in any way and, thus, no field preemption argument is properly before us. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[5]  At oral argument, the appellants stated that they were making both facial and as-applied challenges. The record belies that statement. Although their brief characterizes the complaint as contesting the Ordinance \"on its face and as applied,\" the appellants argued the case in the district court as a facial challenge and the district court decided it on that basis. <i>See </i><i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 288. That approach was unavoidable as the appellants failed to introduce any evidence sufficient to underpin an as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p>[6]  No specific claim is made in this case that persons exonerated from charges brought under the Ordinance have been unable either to get the orange stickers removed from their residences or to have their names and addresses expunged from the rosters of offenders and offending sites. <i>Cf. </i><i>Los Angeles Cnty. v. Humphries,</i> 562 U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 447, 449-50, 178 L.Ed.2d 460 (2010) (addressing 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim brought by plaintiffs who were accused of child abuse, later exonerated, yet were unable to convince relevant officials to remove their names from a widely available central index).</p>\n<p>[7]  In their discussion of procedural due process, the appellants repeatedly mention that a posting under the Ordinance exposes them to prosecution and fines. But they neither present this exposure as a \"plus\" factor nor otherwise tie it to any specific legal doctrine.</p>\n<p>[8]  Of course, under the L &amp; T Act a tenant \"charged with violating a municipal ordinance\" may be subject to an expedited eviction. R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36(f). Although this provision may constitute a basis, beyond the explicit terms of the lease, for terminating a tenancy more quickly, it does not create a property interest outside of the lease.</p>\n<p>[9]  The appellants also suggest that the \"right of landlord and tenant to contract . . . is infringed\" by the overbreadth of the Ordinance. The appellants, however, have offered no authority to suggest that the right to contract is a recognized First Amendment interest. Manifestly, it is not.</p>\n<p>[10]  We reproduce here the version of the Ordinance that is currently available through the Town's official website. This version differs in a small number of petty ways from the version of the Ordinance on record in this case as an attachment to the agreed statement of facts. Any differences are of absolutely no significance in the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n\n</div>",

Each summer, the Town experiences a substantial influx of seasonal residents. Each fall, the Town empties out, leaving a large number of dwellings unoccupied. The Town's proximity to the University of Rhode Island (URI) makes these dwellings attractive for student housing.</p>\n<p>This thriving rental market among college students has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, the clamor for student housing is an economic boon to property owners willing to rent their dwellings. On the other hand, the sheer mass of exuberant young people and their predilections have proven to be a threat to the quality of life in a quiet enclave.</p>\n<p>In an effort to balance these competing concerns, the Town adopted a novel ordinance authorizing local police officers to post a bright orange sticker at the front entrance of any residence found to have hosted an \"unruly gathering.\" The ordinance has had its detractors, and this case was brought as a multifaceted challenge to it. The challengers complain that the ordinance is both preempted by state law and unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>The district court, in a thoughtful and comprehensive rescript, rejected these plaints. <i>See </i><i>URI Student Senate v. Town of Narragansett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540870\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540870/uri-student-senate-v-town-of-narragansett/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span> (D.R.I.2010). After careful consideration, we find that the Town's unorthodox solution to the problems caused by unruly gatherings does not, on its face, offend either state law or the United States Constitution. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We first recount the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the ordinance and summarize its terms. We then limn the travel of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Ordinance.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Narragansett Town Council initially adopted an \"unruly gatherings\" ordinance in 2005. It amended that ordinance in 2007. The amended version (the Ordinance), codified at chapter 46, article II, of the Town's Code of Ordinances, remains in force. We refer throughout to that version, which is reprinted in the appendix.</p>\n<p>Section 46-31 of the Ordinance empowers local police officers to intervene at and disperse gatherings that are sparking \"a substantial disturbance.\" The police may only do so, however, when the disturbance involves \"a violation of law.\" Subsection (a) provides an illustrative list of instances of unlawful conduct that might constitute such a violation (e.g., excessive noise, obstruction of public streets, illegal parking, public drunkenness or urination, service of alcohol to minors).</p>\n<p>Once the police have abated and dispersed an unruly gathering, subsection 46-32(a) authorizes them to prominently post a notice on the premises. This notice takes the form of a bright orange ten-by-fourteen-inch sticker, which is affixed on or near the front entrance of the building.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> The sticker contains an explicit message. It admonishes that, should police intervention be required in response to another violation at the same address during the same posting period, various parties (e.g., the owners and residents of the premises, the sponsors of the unruly gathering, and any guests who cause a nuisance) will be held jointly and severally liable. Landlords are informed by mail of both the posting and the violation that led to it.</p>\n<p>The Ordinance makes explicit allowance for certain defenses to prosecution for a subsequent violation. For example, under subsection 46-34(a)(5), a showing that only uninvited participants engaged in the proscribed conduct serves as a defense for innocent landlords, tenants, or event sponsors. To assert this defense, a landlord, tenant, or sponsor must show that she took \"all steps reasonably necessary to exclude\" the responsible individuals. As to landlords, such exclusionary actions include \"actively attempting\" to evict boisterous tenants.</p>\n<p>The posting periods prescribed by subsection 46-32(a) correspond with the economic realities of the seasonal housing cycle. If a building is posted between the beginning of September and the end of May, the sticker must remain in place until May 31. If a building is posted between the beginning of June and the end of August, the sticker must remain in place until August 31.</p>\n<p>Under subsection 46-32(b), landlords and tenants are jointly responsible for maintaining the notice in place. If a landlord or tenant removes the sticker, abets its removal, or tampers with it during the posting period, she is subject to a fine.</p>\n<p>Section 46-35 delineates the penalties associated with infractions at previously posted dwellings. Under subsection (a), the first post-posting intervention during a given posting period incurs a $300 fine; the second, a $400 fine; and any further intervention, a $500 fine. Under subsection (b), violators may be required to perform community service or, for repeat offenders, community service is mandatory.</p>\n<p>The Town routinely compiles statistics relating to its enforcement of the Ordinance. Its roster of offending dwellings includes all addresses at which police officers have intervened to abate and disperse unruly gatherings. It also maintains a list that features data relating to Ordinance violations committed by URI students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In May of 2008, the appellants challenged the Ordinance in a Rhode Island court. The defendants removed the case to the district court in pursuance of federal question jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.</p>\n<p>The lead plaintiff-appellant is the URI Student Senate, which claims to represent the interests of URI students generally. The remaining plaintiffs, also appellants here, can be sorted into three categories. The first group comprises individual URI students who reside in Narragansett and have felt the sting of the Ordinance. These appellants claim, among other things, that they have been subjected to university disciplinary procedures as a result of violating the Ordinance.<sup>[2]</sup> The second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> group consists of URI students whose rented abodes have been posted with orange stickers. These appellants claim that they were evicted from their homes and referred to the URI Student Life Office as a result. The last group comprises landlords who have had their rental properties posted. These appellants claim that they have been unable to re-rent their properties and, consequently, have lost rental income. The defendants, appellees here, are the Town and a galaxy of municipal officials. For ease in exposition, we refer to the Town as if it were the sole defendant.</p>\n<p>The complaint is cast mostly, but not entirely, as a series of constitutional challenges. The exception is a preemption claim positing that the Ordinance is preempted by a state statute. The constitutional claims allege variously that the Ordinance (i) violates substantive due process, (ii) is unconstitutionally vague, (iii) is overbroad, (iv) offends the requirements of procedural due process, and (v) deprives the appellants of equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p>In due season, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts. The district court denied the appellants' motion and granted the cross-motion. <i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 304. The court expressed concern about the absence of any pre-posting opportunity to challenge the orange stickers, <i>id.</i> at 296, 302, but nonetheless upheld the Ordinance. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We begin our analysis with the preemption claim and then move to the constitutional claims. Before undertaking this exegesis, we pause to memorialize the standard of review.</p>\n<p>We review an appeal from the entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Osediacz v. City of Cranston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201681\"><a href=\"/opinion/201681/osediacz-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 139 (1st Cir.2005). In so doing, we take the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving party. <i>Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v.

Gen. Laws §§ 34-18-1 to 34-18-57. As its title implies, the L &amp; T Act speaks to the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants within Rhode Island. <i>See id.</i> §§ 34-18-2, 34-18-7. In advocating preemption, the appellants rely on section 34-18-36, which gives most tenants the right to cure any material breach of a rental agreement prior to eviction.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under Rhode Island law, a municipal ordinance may be preempted by a state statutory scheme either if the ordinance conflicts with the statutory scheme or if it can be shown that the General Assembly intended its statutory scheme to occupy the whole of the regulatory field in connection with a given subject. <i>Amico's Inc. v. Mattos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2109005\"><a href=\"/opinion/2109005/amicos-inc-v-mattos/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span>, 907 (R.I. 2002); <i>Town of Warren v. Thornton-Whitehouse,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2324678\"><a href=\"/opinion/2324678/town-of-warren-v-thornton-whitehouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1261 (R.I. 1999). The appellants' preemption argument rests on the first of these lines of attack: the supposed existence of a conflict between the Ordinance and the L &amp; T Act.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The appellants contend that the Ordinance conflicts with section 34-18-36 of the L &amp; T Act because it \"requires\" a landlord to evict an offending tenant without providing the tenant with an opportunity to cure. Eviction is required, the appellants say, so that the landlord can avoid liability for subsequent Ordinance violations at posted properties.</p>\n<p>This argument represents a triumph of hope over reason. The Ordinance does not <i>require</i> a landlord to initiate eviction proceedings against an offending tenant. Rather, section 46-34(a)(5) explains that the owner of a previously posted property may avoid liability for a subsequent unruly gathering at that location as long as the owner is \"actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.\" Affording the landlord an \"ongoing eviction\" defense is not tantamount, either legally or practically, to compelling him to institute eviction proceedings.</p>\n<p>The appellants try to dodge this bullet. They note that, under the L &amp; T Act, the first step in evicting a tenant is the issuance of a noncompliance notice. R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36. The appellants declare that this provision grounds a preemption claim because sending a notice of noncompliance is antithetic to an active attempt at eviction.</p>\n<p>This ipse dixit is not accompanied by any explanation as to why or how the transmittal of a notice of noncompliance interferes with, let alone negates, the active pursuit of eviction. Bearing in mind that sending such a notice is the first step in the eviction pavane, the two acts seem entirely compatible. Certainly, there is nothing in either the text of the Ordinance or the letter of the L &amp; T Act that precludes simultaneous compliance with both.</p>\n<p>In all events, conflict preemption requires a direct conflict or something very close to it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117918\"><a href=\"/opinion/117918/freightliner-corp-v-myrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117918\"><a href=\"/opinion/117918/freightliner-corp-v-myrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117918\"><a href=\"/opinion/117918/freightliner-corp-v-myrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1995) (explaining that implied conflict preemption may exist where it is \"impossible for a . . . party to comply with both . . . requirements\" or where a provision \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\" of the legislature (quotations omitted)). An awkward fit, without more, will not support a claim of conflict preemption.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, we are unable to discern either a direct conflict or an irreconcilable inconsistency between the provisions of the Ordinance and the provisions of the L &amp; T Act. We therefore hold, without serious question, that the L &amp; T Act does not preempt the Ordinance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Constitutional Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants advance a compendium of constitutional challenges to the Ordinance. Because they have not pressed either their generalized substantive due process or equal protection claims, we eschew any further discussion of those initiatives. Without exception, what remains are facial challenges.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> 1. Procedural Due Process. We start with the contention that the Ordinance deprives both landlords and tenants of procedural due process. The appellants pounce on the fact that the Ordinance allows the police to plaster an orange sticker on a dwelling without affording either the landlord or the tenants any opportunity for a hearing.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>It is familiar lore that the essence of procedural due process is prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2701</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1972). But this principle does not operate in a vacuum. In order to show a deprivation of procedural due process, a party must first show that the challenged action implicates a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. <i>Id.</i> at 569-70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2701</span></a></span>; <i>Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of HUD,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201789\"><a href=\"/opinion/201789/redondo-borges-v-housing-and-urban/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.</p>\n<p>In an effort to cross this threshold, the appellants focus on reputational harm, that is, the allegedly stigmatizing effects of the Ordinance. They say that when a residence is posted with an orange sticker, both the landlord and the tenants are publicly branded as criminals. They add that this stigma is heightened by the Town's action in keeping a publicly available register of all posted premises.</p>\n<p>Student tenants are alleged to suffer a further detriment. When an orange sticker is posted on premises occupied by a university student, the Town informs URI. In the appellants' view, this additional step exposes student tenants to disciplinary proceedings and exacerbates the stigmatizing effect of the postings.</p>\n<p>This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. In constitutional jurisprudence, stigmatization is a term of art. The Supreme Court has made clear that a procedural due process claim cannot rest upon reputational harm alone. <i>Paul v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 701, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1976). Thus, when a person alleges that she has suffered stigmatization at the hands of a government actor, she must show an adverse effect on some interest \"more tangible\" than reputational harm. <i>Id.</i> To use the popular catch phrase, the complaining party must satisfy a \"stigma plus\" standard. <i>Pendleton v. City of Haverhill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198106\"><a href=\"/opinion/198106/pendleton-v-haverhill/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The \"plus\" part of this formulation is not an empty formality. In determining whether there exists a cognizable harm, the stigma plus standard requires us to address two distinct components: (i) the nature of the incremental harm to which the appellants point and (ii) the source of that harm.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> A party who claims a violation of her procedural due process rights based on reputational harm must show that the challenged governmental action adversely impacted some right or status previously enjoyed by her under substantive state or federal law. <i>See </i><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>; <i>Silva v. Worden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197655\"><a href=\"/opinion/197655/silva-v-worden/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.1997). For this purpose, harm to a right or status that does not emanate from substantive state or federal law is insufficient. Such harm thus does not qualify as harm to a more tangible interest within the purview of the stigma plus standard. <i>See </i><i>Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p>The nature of the affected interest is not the only hurdle that a complaining party must overcome in order to satisfy the stigma plus standard. The standard requires that the change in rights or status be directly attributable to the challenged governmental action. <i>Id.</i> Where the stigma and the incremental harmthe \"plus\" factorderive from distinct sources, a party cannot make out a viable procedural due process claim. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hawkins v. R.I. Lottery Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199257\"><a href=\"/opinion/199257/hawkins-v-rhode-island-lottery/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 116 (1st Cir.2001). That is true even if both sources are government entities. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellants acknowledge that a showing beyond purely reputational harm is required by the stigma plus standard. To meet that requirement, they describe two injuries that they claim result from the postings.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>First, the appellants aver that the L &amp; T Act provides them with rights \"to housing, to cure breaches, to notice, [and] to possession.\" Second, they tout the \"right to rent and live in Narragansett free of public branding.\" These rights, they insist, implicate protected liberty and property interests, and the infringement of them suffices to trigger the stigma plus standard.</p>\n<p>There is, however, no cognizable harm. The appellants say that some landlords have been unable to re-rent posted dwellings. Taking this as true, the resulting loss of rent is not a viable \"plus\" factor. Nothing in the L &amp; T Act (or elsewhere in state law, for that matter) confers on landlords an entitlement to have rental units fully occupied. Rather, the L &amp; T Act for the most part leaves the negotiation of leases and rates to the marketplacethat is, to the landlord and each prospective tenant. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-15(a). This framework plainly contemplates that rental income is contingent on the availability of willing renters. Viewed against this backdrop, it cannot seriously be suggested that state law creates an entitlement to a steady stream of rental income that would qualify as a \"more tangible\" interest (and, thus, as a \"plus\" factor).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the vacancies that the appellants lament do not result from state action but, rather, from the actions of third parties. After all, it is prospective tenants, acting without government compulsion, who decide whether or not to rent particular dwellings. A prospective tenant can base her decision not to rent on a multitude of factors including cost, location, amenities, and condition. There is nothing that prevents her, <i>as a private party,</i> from weighing in this balance the presence of an orange sticker. These third-party decisions are not attributable to state action in the requisite sense. <i>See </i><i>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110766\"><a href=\"/opinion/110766/lugar-v-edmondson-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 937-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110766\"><a href=\"/opinion/110766/lugar-v-edmondson-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2744</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110766\"><a href=\"/opinion/110766/lugar-v-edmondson-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span> (1982) (describing circumstances in which private party's actions may be considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> \"fairly attributable\" to the state); <i>Logiodice v. Trs. of Me. Cent. Inst.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778294\"><a href=\"/opinion/778294/zachariah-logiodice-v-trustees-of-maine-central-institute-douglas-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (similar). When a specified harm is predicated on voluntary third-party behavior, it cannot serve as a \"plus\" factor. <i>Pendleton,</i> 156 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p>The student tenants' proposed \"plus\" factor is no more robust. This claim relies on evictions as a source of harm. It suggests that a tenant has a right to peaceable enjoyment of a rented dwelling free from eviction and that, therefore, eviction represents a cognizable \"plus\" factor. This is too sanguine a view.</p>\n<p>The student tenants' claim is defeated by the fact that their residential rights derive primarily from private contracts (leases) between private parties (landlords and tenants), which entail private obligations. The L &amp; T Act does not itself create a right to tenancies of any particular duration. In the last analysis, it is the lease terms (and the tenant's compliance with them) that generally determine the tenant's right to remain in a rented dwelling.<sup>[8]</sup> That is dispositive because a constitutionally protected property interest must rest on a right or status conferred by state law, not merely on the complaining party's unilateral expectations. <i>See </i><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>; <i>Roth,</i> 408 U.S. at 577, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2701</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Of course, we recognize that there are situations in which the Ordinance might be enforced in such a way as to implicate the legitimate, constitutionally protectable property rights of affected landlords and tenants. The record in this case, however, does not contain any indication that such events have transpired. Though we conclude that, on the record before us, the appellants have failed to show that enforcement of the Ordinance has resulted in harm to a cognizable liberty or property interest, this conclusion does not preclude the possibility of a meritorious as-applied challenge premised on more fully developed facts.</p>\n<p>The district court also considered whether the fact that students had been subjected to URI disciplinary procedures could serve as a \"plus\" factor. <i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 301-02. It rejected that hypothesis. <i>Id.</i> at 301. The appellants do not mount a credible challenge to this conclusion: although they note in their briefs that students were referred to URI for possible discipline, they do not point specifically to these referrals as a source of incremental harm. Nor do they offer any explanation as to how disciplinary referrals might constitute a \"plus\" factor. Any argument to this effect is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The appellants have one last arrow in this quiver. They complain that the Ordinance prevents them from living in Narragansett. That is codswallop pure and simple: the Ordinance does not prevent anyone from living anywhere. Although the Ordinance creates consequences for those who choose to reside in the Town but fail to abide by the law, these consequences, whether viewed singly or collectively, do not constitute harm to any tangible interest enjoyed by the appellants.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We, like the district court, are uneasy about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> the absence of a hearing. In addition, we recognize that there are potential applications of the Ordinance that might impair constitutionally protected liberty or property interests (say, if the police were to enforce the Ordinance in an invidiously discriminatory way). But the appellants have brought a facial challenge, not an as-applied challenge, and the record is barren of evidence that unconstitutional applications have occurred. The mere possibility of misuse is insufficient to invalidate an ordinance on a facial attack. <i>See </i><i>Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112482\"><a href=\"/opinion/112482/ohio-v-akron-center-for-reproductive-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 514, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112482\"><a href=\"/opinion/112482/ohio-v-akron-center-for-reproductive-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1990).</p>\n<p>To conclude, the appellants have failed to demonstrate, as would be required to sustain a facial challenge, that any of the incremental harms to which they point in the hope of satisfying the requirements of the stigma plus standard inevitably results from the Ordinance's implementation. We therefore reject the appellants' procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Overbreadth.</i> The appellants complain that the Ordinance is overly broad. The focal point of this plaint is their allegation that the Ordinance penalizes landlords and tenants merely because of their association with a place or an event and, thus, trenches upon the First Amendment right of association.<sup>[9]</sup> Landlords and tenants, they say, are free to host social gatherings and invite such persons as they may wish.</p>\n<p>We need not linger long over this asseveration. \"[T]he overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when `judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>Chicago v. Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118299\"><a href=\"/opinion/118299/chicago-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118299\"><a href=\"/opinion/118299/chicago-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It follows that \"reasonable breadth\" in the terms employed by an ordinance does not require that it be invalidated on vagueness grounds. <i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2294</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We are convinced that the Ordinance is sufficiently clear to survive the appellants' vagueness challenge. Words such as \"substantial\" and \"significant,\" if read in a vacuum, might be problematic. <i>Cf. </i><i>Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392029\"><a href=\"/opinion/392029/fantasy-book-shop-inc-lotten-books-inc-and-journal-books-inc-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1119, 1123-24 (1st Cir.1981) (finding impermissibly vague provision allowing denial of license where granting it would \"otherwise significantly harm[] the legitimate protectable interests of the affected citizens of the city\" (alteration in original)). Here, however, the challenged phrases do not appear in a vacuum. The Ordinance contains additional terms that supply concrete guidance as to the behavior that it prohibits and the circumstances in which it can be enforced.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most important, section 46-31 authorizes police intervention only in the event that \"conduct constituting a violation of law\" occurs. The prerequisite \"violation of law\" must pertain to some law other than the Ordinance itself. In our view, the requirement that a violation of law be committed as a condition precedent to police intervention provides adequate guidance to ensure that the Ordinance is not arbitrarily enforced. <i>See </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 112, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2294</span></a></span> (noting that existence of particularized enforcement context may undercut claim of vagueness).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the Ordinance withstands the appellants' assault is reinforced by other considerations. First, subsection 46-31(a) furnishes a non-exhaustive list of predicate offenses that will allow a police officer to enforce the Ordinance. The existence of clear examples of conduct covered by a law may, in certain circumstances, help to insulate the law against an accusation of vagueness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Parker v. Levy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109077\"><a href=\"/opinion/109077/parker-v-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 754, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109077\"><a href=\"/opinion/109077/parker-v-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span> (1974).</p>\n<p>Second, we are privy to a straightforward articulation of the Town's purpose in adopting the Ordinance. This clear statement helps to dispel any uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has looked to an ordinance's preamble to ascertain what activity it was intended to prohibit. <i>See </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 110-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2294</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>IMS Health,</i> 550 F.3d at 62 (noting that, in adjudicating a facial vagueness challenge, \"the state's articulated purpose narrows the interpretive lens through which we must view the problem\"). The preamble to the original version of the Ordinance explains that \"due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people. . . frequently become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public.\" It goes on to explain that the Town is required to respond over and over to such gatherings \"to restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety\" and that such repetitive responses unduly burden municipal resources. It is thus apparent that the Ordinance is aimed at \"discourag[ing] the occurrence of repeated loud and unruly gatherings.\" We think that this plainly articulated purpose is a significant contextual clue. In this instance, it helps to inform the meaning of the contested language.</p>\n<p>In the interest of clarity, we note that we read the Ordinance to require that, in order to impose liability under sections 46-34 and 46-35, the prosecution most prove that a gathering creating a substantial disturbance involving a violation of law occurred both at the time of the initial posting and when the subsequent intervention took place. Police intervention at a residence is not enough, by itself, to establish an Ordinance violation. Thus, the penalties prescribed by the Ordinancefines and community servicecannot flow merely from a police officer's decision to intervene at a gathering.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that, viewed in context, it is clear what conduct the Ordinance as a whole forbids. Taken together, the requirement that someone at a gathering must have committed a predicate offense, the list of examples of violations of law that might serve as such a predicate to police intervention included in the Ordinance, and the Town's articulated concern about quality-of-life issues provide sufficient enforcement guidance to police and adequately define the type of behaviors prohibited by the Ordinance. One can envision many permissible applications of the Ordinance. No more is exigible to ward off a facial challenge premised on vagueness grounds. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates,</i> 455 U.S. at 497, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110661\"><a href=\"/opinion/110661/hoffman-estates-v-flipside-hoffman-estates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For the reasons articulated above, we uphold the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>Appendix</i><sup>[10]</sup></h2>\n<p>The current version of the Ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-31. Public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) It shall be a public nuisance to conduct a gathering of five or more persons on any private property in a manner which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a significant segment of a neighborhood, as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law. Illustrative of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic, obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, illegal parking, public drunkenness, public urination, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, and litter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A gathering constituting a public nuisance may be abated by all reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order requiring the gathering to be disbanded and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under any applicable ordinances and state statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-32. Notice of unruly gathering; posting, mailing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> (a) When the police department intervenes at a gathering which constitutes a nuisance under this article, the premises at which such nuisance occurred shall be posted with a notice stating that the intervention of the police has been necessitated as a result of a public nuisance under this article caused by an event at the premises, the date of the police intervention, and that any subsequent event within the period set forth below on the same premises, which necessitates police intervention, shall result in the joint and several liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, or any persons who own or are residents of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, or who sponsored the event constituting the public nuisance as more fully set forth below. Any notice posted between September 1 and May 31 of any year shall remain posted until May 31. Any notice posted between June 1 and August 31 of any year shall remain posted until August 31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) The residents and owner of such property shall be jointly responsible for ensuring that such notice is not removed or defaced and it shall be a Code violation carrying a penalty of a minimum, mandatory $100.00 fine in addition to any other penalties which may be due under this section if such notice is removed, obscured or defaced, provided, however, that the residents of the premises or sponsor of the event, if present, shall be consulted as to the location in which such notice is posted in order to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-33. Mailing of notice to property owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Notice of the intervention shall also be mailed to any property owner on the Town of Narragansett property tax assessment records and shall advise the property owner that any subsequent such intervention within posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a) on the same premises shall result in liability of the property owner for all penalties associated with such intervention as more particularly set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-34. Persons liable for subsequent response to gathering constituting a public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) If the police department is required to respond to a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the premises more than once in any posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a), the following persons shall be jointly and severally liable for fines as set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The person or persons who own the property where the gathering constituting the public nuisance took place, provided that notice has been mailed to the owner of the property as set forth herein and the gathering occurs at least two weeks after the mailing of such notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the property where such gathering took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) All persons attending such gatherings who engage in any activity resulting in the public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises, including landlords who are actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> (b) Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sec. 46-35. Penalties for violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) It shall be a Code violation punishable as set forth herein when intervention at the same location to abate a gathering constituting a public nuisance occurs within any posting periods set forth in section 46-32(a) after the property was posted in accordance with section 46-11:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) For the first intervention in a posting period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $300.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) For the second such intervention in a posting period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $400.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) For any further such responses in a posting day period the fine shall be a minimum mandatory $500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) In addition to the above, the municipal court shall be authorized to order the person or persons in violation to perform community service. For a first intervention ordering community service shall be discretionary. For a second or third intervention, the municipal court shall, in addition to the monetary penalty set forth above, order the person or persons in violation to perform not less than 25 hours of community service for a second intervention and not less than 50 hours of community service for a third intervention.</blockquote>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record does not explain why the color orange was selected. Thus, like Nathaniel Hawthorne reflecting on a similar conundrum, one wonders if there is \"some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to [one's] sensibilities, but evading the analysis of [one's] mind.\" Nathaniel Hawthorne, <i>The Scarlet Letter,</i> intro.

The case at hand does not turn on any such distinction and, thus, we refer to tenants generally.</p>\n<p>[4]  In their opening brief, the appellants make a passing reference to section 34-18-7 as a possible source of field preemption. This reference is not developed in any way and, thus, no field preemption argument is properly before us. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[5]  At oral argument, the appellants stated that they were making both facial and as-applied challenges. The record belies that statement. Although their brief characterizes the complaint as contesting the Ordinance \"on its face and as applied,\" the appellants argued the case in the district court as a facial challenge and the district court decided it on that basis. <i>See </i><i>URI Student Senate,</i> 707 F.Supp.2d at 288. That approach was unavoidable as the appellants failed to introduce any evidence sufficient to underpin an as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p>[6]  No specific claim is made in this case that persons exonerated from charges brought under the Ordinance have been unable either to get the orange stickers removed from their residences or to have their names and addresses expunged from the rosters of offenders and offending sites. <i>Cf. </i><i>Los Angeles Cnty. v. Humphries,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180037\"><a href=\"/opinion/180037/los-angeles-county-v-humphries/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 449-50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180037\"><a href=\"/opinion/180037/los-angeles-county-v-humphries/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span> (2010) (addressing 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim brought by plaintiffs who were accused of child abuse, later exonerated, yet were unable to convince relevant officials to remove their names from a widely available central index).</p>\n<p>[7]  In their discussion of procedural due process, the appellants repeatedly mention that a posting under the Ordinance exposes them to prosecution and fines. But they neither present this exposure as a \"plus\" factor nor otherwise tie it to any specific legal doctrine.</p>\n<p>[8]  Of course, under the L &amp; T Act a tenant \"charged with violating a municipal ordinance\" may be subject to an expedited eviction. R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-36(f). Although this provision may constitute a basis, beyond the explicit terms of the lease, for terminating a tenancy more quickly, it does not create a property interest outside of the lease.</p>\n<p>[9]  The appellants also suggest that the \"right of landlord and tenant to contract . . . is infringed\" by the overbreadth of the Ordinance. The appellants, however, have offered no authority to suggest that the right to contract is a recognized First Amendment interest. Manifestly, it is not.</p>\n<p>[10]  We reproduce here the version of the Ordinance that is currently available through the Town's official website. This version differs in a small number of petty ways from the version of the Ordinance on record in this case as an attachment to the agreed statement of facts. Any differences are of absolutely no significance in the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n\n</div>",
