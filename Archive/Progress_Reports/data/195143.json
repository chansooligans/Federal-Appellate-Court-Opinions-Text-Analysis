Petitioner  Alberto Cabral de  Faria seeks\n                \n\nreview  of  an order  of  the  Board of  Immigration  Appeals\n\nrequiring that  he be  deported to Canada.   Finding  that no\n\nsubstantial  question  is   presented,  we  summarily  affirm\n\npursuant to Loc. R. 27.1. \n\n                              I.\n\n     Petitioner, a  Canadian native and citizen,  has resided\n\nin  this country  for  27 of  his  34 years.    In 1991,  the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with\n\nbeing deportable  under 8  U.S.C.    1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) as  an\n\nalien who  had been convicted  of two crimes  involving moral\n\nturpitude.  The two crimes cited in the show cause order were\n\na 1990 larceny conviction and  a 1991 assault conviction.  At\n\na  hearing   in  September  1992,  petitioner   conceded  his\n\ndeportability and  requested a  discretionary waiver  under 8\n\nU.S.C.   1182(c).  A hearing to address this request was held\n\non October  13, 1992.   The INS there introduced  evidence of\n\nvarious other  criminal offenses  petitioner had  committed--\n\nincluding a 1985  conviction for breaking and  entering (b&amp;e)\n\nand  a  1990   conviction  for  possession  with   intent  to\n\ndistribute a  controlled substance.  Based on  this and other\n\nevidence, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the request for  \n\n212(c) relief at the close  of the hearing.  Petitioner filed\n\nno appeal to the Board from this decision.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Instead,  on October 27,  he filed an  application for a\n\nstay of deportation with the  District Director, representing\n\nthat the state court had vacated the larceny conviction  that\n\nvery day.1   The INS  responded six days  later by moving  to\n\nreopen the  deportation proceedings  pursuant to  8 C.F.R.   \n\n242.22.   Pointing to  petitioner's contention regarding  the\n\nlarceny  offense,  it  requested  reopening  (1)  so  that  a\n\nseparate  conviction   (the  1985   b&amp;e  offense)   could  be\n\n\"substituted\"  for  the   larceny  conviction  in  order   to\n\n\"reestablish deportability,\"  and (2)  so that  the IJ  could\n\nconsider whether the vacation of the larceny conviction might\n\naffect the earlier denial of   212(c) relief.  The IJ  agreed\n\nto reopen  the proceedings.   The INS amended the  show cause\n\norder  to substitute  the  b&amp;e  conviction  for  the  larceny\n\nconviction.   A subsequent amendment  set forth the 1990 drug\n\nconviction as  a separate basis  for deportability.  At  a de\n\nnovo hearing held  in March 1993, the IJ  found petitioner to\n\nbe deportable on both grounds:  as one who had been convicted\n\nof two  crimes of moral  turpitude (based on the  assault and\n\nb&amp;e convictions),  and as  one who had  been convicted  of an\n\n                    \n\n1.  While the stay  application and the state  court decision\nare  not in  the record before  us, the INS  does not dispute\nthat the  larceny conviction was  vacated.  Neither  side has\nidentified  the  basis  for such  action.    We presume  that\npetitioner gained  relief pursuant to  Mass. G.L.  c. 278,   \n29D,  which requires  a court  to inform  a defendant  of the\nimmigration  consequences of a  guilty plea.   Petitioner has\nchallenged  at least  one other  of his  convictions on  this\nground.  \n\n                             -3-\n\naggravated  felony (based  on the  drug  conviction).   See 8\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).   The request for    212(c)\n\nrelief was again denied.  The BIA on appeal affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision, and petitioner has now sought review in this court.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Petitioner  does not  challenge  the  substance  of  the\n\nagency's findings concerning  deportability and discretionary\n\nrelief.      Instead,   he   advances   several    procedural\n\nobjections.2  His  principal contention is that  the decision\n\nto reopen the deportation proceedings was in contravention of\n\nthe governing  regulations.  For  example, 8 C.F.R.    242.22\n\nprovides in  relevant part: \"A  motion to reopen will  not be\n\ngranted  unless  the  immigration  judge  is  satisfied  that\n\nevidence  sought  to  be  offered  is  material  and was  not\n\navailable and could  not have been discovered or presented at\n\nthe  hearing.\"  Similarly, 8 C.F.R.   103.5(a)(2)(i) provides\n\nthat a  motion to reopen  must \"[s]tate the  new facts  to be\n\nproved at  the reopened proceeding.\"   See also id.    3.8(a)\n                                                   \n\n(same).   Petitioner argues  that the  allegedly \"new\"  facts\n\n                    \n\n2.  One of petitioner's central arguments to the BIA was that\nthe IJ had neglected to consider his opposition to the motion\nto  reopen.   Indeed,  the  IJ  stated  that the  motion  was\n\"unopposed,\"  even though  petitioner's  opposition had  been\nfiled in timely fashion the previous  day.  The BIA on appeal\naddressed this complaint  by considering the matter  de novo.\nAny error that  might have attended the IJ's  action was thus\nharmless.  See, e.g., Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 762 n.6\n                                      \n(1st Cir.  1992).   Petitioner has not  pursued the  point in\nthis court.     \n\n                             -4-\n\nproffered by  the INS--the  evidence concerning  his b&amp;e  and\n\ndrug convictions--were not  newly discovered at all  and thus\n\nprovided no basis for reopening.  \n\n     This  argument  misconstrues  the  INS'  motion.    What\n\nprompted the request to reopen  was not the evidence of other\n\ncrimes but rather  the fact that,  subsequent to the  initial\n\nhearing, the larceny conviction was vacated.  This occurrence\n\nwas not  only \"new\"  but \"material\" as  well, given  that the\n\nvalidity of the  original deportation order was  dependent on\n\nthat  conviction.   Numerous courts  have  observed that  the\n\noverturning  of a  conviction  upon which  deportability  was\n\npremised is an appropriate basis for reopening administrative\n\nproceedings.   See, e.g., Escobar  v. INS, 935 F.2d  650, 652\n                                         \n\n(4th Cir. 1991) (noting that INS had requested BIA to \"reopen\n\nand terminate\" deportation  proceedings following expungement\n\nof  conviction); Wiedersperg v.  INS, 896 F.2d  1179, 1182-83\n                                    \n\n(9th  Cir. 1990)  (abuse of  discretion to deny  reopening in\n\nsuch  context); Becerra-Jimenez v. INS, 829 F.2d 996, 1000-02\n                                      \n\n(10th Cir.  1987) (due  to expunction  of convictions,  court\n\nremands  for agency consideration of motion to reopen); Haghi\n                                                             \n\nv. Russell, 744 F. Supp. 249, 251-52 (D. Col. 1990) (vacation\n          \n\nof conviction is \"new and  material evidence\" within 8 C.F.R.\n\n  3.2).  We thus find  no abuse of discretion in the  Board's\n\nruling that  the  procedural prerequisites  to reopening  had\n\nbeen satisfied.  See, e.g.,  INS v. Doherty, 112 S. Ct.  719,\n                                           \n\n                             -5-\n\n724-25  (1992) (ruling on motion to reopen reviewed for abuse\n\nof discretion);  INS v.  Abudu, 485 U.S.  94, 99  n.3, 104-05\n                              \n\n(1988) (same).3\n\n     Petitioner's  real complaint, of course, is not with the\n\nallowance of  the motion to  reopen per se,4 but  rather with\n\nthe purpose for which the INS sought reopening--i.e., to file\n\nsubstitute   charges   in    order   to   \"reestablish\"   his\n\ndeportability.   Before this court, petitioner has advanced a\n\nseparate argument in this vein,  contending that introduction\n\nof the  drug offense  was impermissible because  the INS  had\n\nmade  no reference  thereto in  its motion  to reopen.   This\n\ncontention  stumbles  over  an   initial  hurdle:  petitioner\n\nneither objected to such evidence at the reopened hearing nor\n\nraised  this issue in  his appeal  to the  BIA.   \"Issues not\n\nraised  before the Board may not be raised for the first time\n\nupon judicial review of the Board's decisions.\"  Ravindran v.\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n3.  Petitioner  also  argues  that the  INS'  motion  was not\n\"supported by  affidavits or other documentary  evidence,\" as\nrequired by 8 C.F.R.    3.8(a), 103.5(a)(2)(ii).   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \nINS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450  U.S. 139, 143 (1981) (per  curiam).\n                   \nEven assuming this contention was adequately presented below,\nwe  are unpersuaded that  the motion's format  was deficient.\nAn affidavit was unnecessary where the new evidence proffered\nby the  INS consisted of an assertion  advanced by petitioner\nhimself in an earlier filing with the agency.  \n\n4.  For  example,   if  the  original  larceny   and  assault\nconvictions  had been the  only ones in  petitioner's record,\nthere is little doubt that he would have been the one seeking\n                             \nreopening  in  October   1992  in  order  to  set  aside  his\ndeportation order.   Indeed, in  a number of the  cases cited\nabove, it is the alien who sought such relief.\n\n                             -6-\n\nINS, 976 F.2d 754, 761  (1st Cir. 1992); accord, e.g., Thomas\n                                                             \n\nv.  INS, 976  F.2d 786,  789  (1st Cir.  1992) (per  curiam);\n       \n\nAlvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                     \n\n     We  perceive no  procedural  impropriety in  any  event.\n\nPursuant to  8 C.F.R.   242.16(d),  the INS \"may at  any time\n\nduring a hearing lodge  additional charges of  deportability,\n\nincluding factual  allegations, against the respondent.\"   We\n\nfind  no basis  for petitioner's  unsupported assertion  that\n\nthis  provision is inapplicable  to reopened hearings.5   Nor\n\ncan we  conclude that  the INS was  guilty of \"piling  on\" or\n\nother  heavy-handed  tactics.    To  be  sure,  both  of  the\n\n\"substitute\"  convictions here could have been charged at the\n\noutset.   Yet there  is no requirement  that the  INS advance\n\nevery  conceivable basis  for deportability  in the  original\n\nshow cause  order.  As  the IJ explained,  such a rule  would\n\nneedlessly  complicate  proceedings in  the vast  majority of\n\ncases.     Moreover,  each  of  the  substitutions  here  was\n\nprompted, not by  dereliction on the part of  the agency, but\n\nby action on the part  of petitioner.  As noted, introduction\n\nof the b&amp;e offense was  occasioned by his success in vacating\n\nthe   larceny  conviction.    And  the  drug  conviction  was\n\n                    \n\n5.  In Rosenberg  v. Fleuti, 374  U.S. 449 (1963),  a similar\n                           \nseries of events  occurred.  A  summary order of  deportation\nwas issued.  It was later discovered that such conviction was\nnot one  for  which  deportation  could  be  ordered.    \"The\ndeportation  proceedings were  thereupon reopened  and  a new\ncharge  [of deportability]  was  lodged against  respondent.\"\nId. at 450.\n   \n\n                             -7-\n\nproffered  as  a  separate basis  for  deportability  only in\n\nresponse  to  petitioner's  suggestion,  during   a  pair  of\n\nhearings in December 1992, that the b&amp;e conviction, in  turn,\n                                       \n\nhad   been    vacated   (a   suggestion    that   was   never\n\nsubstantiated).6   Under these  circumstances,  we think  the\n\nBoard  acted within its  \"broad discretion,\" Doherty,  112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. at 722, in agreeing to reopen the deportation proceedings\n\nto consider the substitute charges.\n\n     The petition for review is  denied.  The motion for stay\n                                                             \n\nof deportation pending review is denied as moot. \n                                                \n\n                    \n\n6.  By means of  a motion dated December 1,  1992, petitioner\nasked  the state court to  vacate this conviction pursuant to\nG.L. c.  278,    29D.   See note 1  supra.   At the  reopened\n                                         \ndeportation hearing, he introduced a copy of this motion with\nthe  handwritten  inscription  \"mot  all\"  appearing  in  the\nmargin,  followed  by a  set  of  initials.   The  IJ,  while\ninferring  that  the   inscription  meant  \"motion  allowed,\"\nrejected this evidence  because of its  improper format.   He\nexplained  that an  official docket  entry  was necessary  to\nprove that the  conviction had been vacated.   Petitioner has\nnot challenged  this ruling,  either before  the BIA or  this\ncourt, and has not otherwise  pursued the contention that the\nb&amp;e conviction has been overturned.     \n\n                             -8-\n",

The INS there introduced  evidence of\n\nvarious other  criminal offenses  petitioner had  committed--\n\nincluding a 1985  conviction for breaking and  entering (b&amp;e)\n\nand  a  1990   conviction  for  possession  with   intent  to\n\ndistribute a  controlled substance.  Based on  this and other\n\nevidence, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the request for  \n\n212(c) relief at the close  of the hearing.  Petitioner filed\n\nno appeal to the Board from this decision.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Instead,  on October 27,  he filed an  application for a\n\nstay of deportation with the  District Director, representing\n\nthat the state court had vacated the larceny conviction  that\n\nvery day.1   The INS  responded six days  later by moving  to\n\nreopen the  deportation proceedings  pursuant to  8 C.F.R.   \n\n242.22.   Pointing to  petitioner's contention regarding  the\n\nlarceny  offense,  it  requested  reopening  (1)  so  that  a\n\nseparate  conviction   (the  1985   b&amp;e  offense)   could  be\n\n\"substituted\"  for  the   larceny  conviction  in  order   to\n\n\"reestablish deportability,\"  and (2)  so that  the IJ  could\n\nconsider whether the vacation of the larceny conviction might\n\naffect the earlier denial of   212(c) relief.  The IJ  agreed\n\nto reopen  the proceedings.   The INS amended the  show cause\n\norder  to substitute  the  b&amp;e  conviction  for  the  larceny\n\nconviction.   A subsequent amendment  set forth the 1990 drug\n\nconviction as  a separate basis  for deportability.  At  a de\n\nnovo hearing held  in March 1993, the IJ  found petitioner to\n\nbe deportable on both grounds:  as one who had been convicted\n\nof two  crimes of moral  turpitude (based on the  assault and\n\nb&amp;e convictions),  and as  one who had  been convicted  of an\n\n                    \n\n1.  While the stay  application and the state  court decision\nare  not in  the record before  us, the INS  does not dispute\nthat the  larceny conviction was  vacated.  Neither  side has\nidentified  the  basis  for such  action.    We presume  that\npetitioner gained  relief pursuant to  Mass. G.L.  c. 278,   \n29D,  which requires  a court  to inform  a defendant  of the\nimmigration  consequences of a  guilty plea.   Petitioner has\nchallenged  at least  one other  of his  convictions on  this\nground.  \n\n                             -3-\n\naggravated  felony (based  on the  drug  conviction).   See 8\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).   The request for    212(c)\n\nrelief was again denied.  The BIA on appeal affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision, and petitioner has now sought review in this court.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Petitioner  does not  challenge  the  substance  of  the\n\nagency's findings concerning  deportability and discretionary\n\nrelief.      Instead,   he   advances   several    procedural\n\nobjections.2  His  principal contention is that  the decision\n\nto reopen the deportation proceedings was in contravention of\n\nthe governing  regulations.  For  example, 8 C.F.R.    242.22\n\nprovides in  relevant part: \"A  motion to reopen will  not be\n\ngranted  unless  the  immigration  judge  is  satisfied  that\n\nevidence  sought  to  be  offered  is  material  and was  not\n\navailable and could  not have been discovered or presented at\n\nthe  hearing.\"  Similarly, 8 C.F.R.   103.5(a)(2)(i) provides\n\nthat a  motion to reopen  must \"[s]tate the  new facts  to be\n\nproved at  the reopened proceeding.\"   See also id.    3.8(a)\n                                                   \n\n(same).   Petitioner argues  that the  allegedly \"new\"  facts\n\n                    \n\n2.  One of petitioner's central arguments to the BIA was that\nthe IJ had neglected to consider his opposition to the motion\nto  reopen.   Indeed,  the  IJ  stated  that the  motion  was\n\"unopposed,\"  even though  petitioner's  opposition had  been\nfiled in timely fashion the previous  day.  The BIA on appeal\naddressed this complaint  by considering the matter  de novo.\nAny error that  might have attended the IJ's  action was thus\nharmless.  See, e.g., Ravindran v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762 n.6\n                                      \n(1st Cir.  1992).   Petitioner has not  pursued the  point in\nthis court.     \n\n                             -4-\n\nproffered by  the INS--the  evidence concerning  his b&amp;e  and\n\ndrug convictions--were not  newly discovered at all  and thus\n\nprovided no basis for reopening.  \n\n     This  argument  misconstrues  the  INS'  motion.    What\n\nprompted the request to reopen  was not the evidence of other\n\ncrimes but rather  the fact that,  subsequent to the  initial\n\nhearing, the larceny conviction was vacated.  This occurrence\n\nwas not  only \"new\"  but \"material\" as  well, given  that the\n\nvalidity of the  original deportation order was  dependent on\n\nthat  conviction.   Numerous courts  have  observed that  the\n\noverturning  of a  conviction  upon which  deportability  was\n\npremised is an appropriate basis for reopening administrative\n\nproceedings.

Before this court, petitioner has advanced a\n\nseparate argument in this vein,  contending that introduction\n\nof the  drug offense  was impermissible because  the INS  had\n\nmade  no reference  thereto in  its motion  to reopen.   This\n\ncontention  stumbles  over  an   initial  hurdle:  petitioner\n\nneither objected to such evidence at the reopened hearing nor\n\nraised  this issue in  his appeal  to the  BIA.   \"Issues not\n\nraised  before the Board may not be raised for the first time\n\nupon judicial review of the Board's decisions.\"  Ravindran v.\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n3.

See, e.g.,\n                                                            \nINS v.

For  example,   if  the  original  larceny   and  assault\nconvictions  had been the  only ones in  petitioner's record,\nthere is little doubt that he would have been the one seeking\n                             \nreopening  in  October   1992  in  order  to  set  aside  his\ndeportation order.

To  be  sure,  both  of  the\n\n\"substitute\"  convictions here could have been charged at the\n\noutset.   Yet there  is no requirement  that the  INS advance\n\nevery  conceivable basis  for deportability  in the  original\n\nshow cause  order.  As  the IJ explained,  such a rule  would\n\nneedlessly  complicate  proceedings in  the vast  majority of\n\ncases.     Moreover,  each  of  the  substitutions  here  was\n\nprompted, not by  dereliction on the part of  the agency, but\n\nby action on the part  of petitioner.  As noted, introduction\n\nof the b&amp;e offense was  occasioned by his success in vacating\n\nthe   larceny  conviction.    And  the  drug  conviction  was\n\n                    \n\n5.

A  summary order of  deportation\nwas issued.  It was later discovered that such conviction was\nnot one  for  which  deportation  could  be  ordered.    \"The\ndeportation  proceedings were  thereupon reopened  and  a new\ncharge  [of deportability]  was  lodged against  respondent.\"\nId. at 450.\n   \n\n                             -7-\n\nproffered  as  a  separate basis  for  deportability  only in\n\nresponse  to  petitioner's  suggestion,  during   a  pair  of\n\nhearings in December 1992, that the b&amp;e conviction, in  turn,\n                                       \n\nhad   been    vacated   (a   suggestion    that   was   never\n\nsubstantiated).6   Under these  circumstances,  we think  the\n\nBoard  acted within its  \"broad discretion,\" Doherty,  112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. at 722, in agreeing to reopen the deportation proceedings\n\nto consider the substitute charges.\n\n     The petition for review is  denied.

By means of  a motion dated December 1,  1992, petitioner\nasked  the state court to  vacate this conviction pursuant to\nG.L. c.  278,    29D.   See note 1  supra.   At the  reopened\n                                         \ndeportation hearing, he introduced a copy of this motion with\nthe  handwritten  inscription  \"mot  all\"  appearing  in  the\nmargin,  followed  by a  set  of  initials.
