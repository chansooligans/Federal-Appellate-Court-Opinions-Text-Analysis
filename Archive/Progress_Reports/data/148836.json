Girón-Anadón, Deputy\nSolicitor General, were on brief, for appellants Salas-Quintana and\nCabezudo.\n     Francisco J. González-Magaz, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             June 17, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            This political discrimination\n\nlawsuit was filed in January 2002 by thirty-six former Ranger\n\ncadets of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental\n\nResources (\"DNER\") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                      The cadets\n\nalleged that they were summarily terminated due to their political\n\naffiliation with the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), in violation of\n\ntheir First Amendment rights, and without notice or a hearing, in\n\nviolation    of   their    due    process    rights    under    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.    They sued three defendants, Salvador Salas-Quintana,\n\nthe Secretary of the DNER at the time of their termination, Lourdes\n\nCabezudo, the Director of Human Resources for the DNER, and Francis\n\nNieves, Special Assistant to the Secretary.\n\n            Twenty-eight of the plaintiffs convinced a jury that\n\ntheir due process rights had been violated by defendants Salas-\n\nQuintana and Cabezudo.           The jury also determined that seven of\n\nthose   twenty-eight        plaintiffs       had      experienced      political\n\ndiscrimination.      The jury awarded compensatory damages in the\n\namount of $19,000 to each of the twenty-eight plaintiffs for the\n\nviolation of their due process rights.                 In addition, the jury\n\nawarded $19,000 in punitive damages to each of the seven plaintiffs\n\nfor the violation of their First Amendment rights.               The defendants\n\nthen moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial; the\n\nplaintiffs   moved   for    reinstatement      to     their    positions.    The\n\ndistrict court denied both motions.           Defendants Salas-Quintana and\n\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\fCabezudo (\"the defendants\") now appeal the district court's denials\n\nof their post-trial motions.1\n\n          Because we find that the defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity on the due process claim, we vacate the jury's\n\nfinding of a due process violation and the related award of\n\ncompensatory damages.   We affirm the jury's finding of a First\n\nAmendment violation and the award of nominal and punitive damages\n\nfor that violation.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We recite some of the relevant facts here in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict for the purpose of background.\n\nOmnipoint Holdings, Inc. v. City of Cranston, 586 F.3d 38, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).   We provide more details when analyzing the claims of\n\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n          This case, not surprisingly, arises from events following\n\nthe general elections held in Puerto Rico on November 8, 2000 which\n\nresulted in the election of a new governor.    See, e.g., Rodríguez-\n\nMarín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2006).   Unlike\n\nthe previous governor, who had been a member of the NPP, the new\n\ngovernor was a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").   In\n\nJanuary of 2001, a new secretary, Carlos Padín, was appointed by\n\nthe new PDP administration to head the DNER.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiffs have not appealed the denial of their request\nfor reinstatement.\n\n                                - 3 -\n\f           Shortly before the election, in August of 2000, the DNER\n\npublished a job announcement seeking cadets for its Ranger Corps.\n\nThe Ranger Corps is a law enforcement body whose mission is to\n\nprotect the environment in Puerto Rico.          Rangers are trained in\n\nenvironmental   protection.      They    carry   guns    and   must   receive\n\nspecialized firearms training.          Whereas Rangers are so-called\n\n\"regular   employees\"    under     the     Puerto       Rico   government's\n\nclassification system, cadets are \"transitory employees.\"             A cadet\n\nbecomes a Ranger by meeting certain physical requirements, passing\n\npsychological exams, and successfully completing a training program\n\nwhich is provided by the DNER after the cadets are hired.\n\n           The twenty-eight remaining plaintiffs in this case (\"the\n\nplaintiffs\") were all hired in late August and early September 2000\n\nafter responding to the August 2000 announcement seeking cadets.\n\nThey were all members of the NPP, hired by the Secretary of the\n\nDNER under the NPP administration.       As part of the hiring process,\n\nthe plaintiffs were sent by the DNER to receive psychological\n\ntesting at INSPIRA, a mental health testing facility.            All of the\n\nplaintiffs received favorable evaluations.              When the new PDP\n\nadministration was elected in November 2000, the cadets had not yet\n\nbeen trained as Rangers.      In December 2000, they were sent to a\n\nspecially-convened training academy, but the academy was suspended\n\nafter only a week.      Although the cadets were told that their\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\ftraining would resume after the holidays, the training academy was\n\nnever reconvened.\n\n               Instead, under Secretary Padín, the DNER waffled about\n\nthe fate of the cadets and whether to resume the training academy,\n\nwhich had been scheduled to reconvene on January 9, 2001.                   In early\n\n2001,    the    Secretary      asked   Ferdinand       Lugo-González,      the    legal\n\nadvisor to the transition team, to conduct a review of all of the\n\ncadets' files, with a specific focus on whether the cadet had or\n\nhad     not    been     administered         the     requisite    psychiatric      and\n\npsychological evaluations.\n\n               Lugo-González testified that the review was conducted\n\nbecause Secretary Padín was being pressured by the PDP leadership\n\nto    fire     the    cadets   who     had    been    appointed    under    the    NPP\n\nadministration.        According to Lugo-González, the resulting report,\n\nwhich    was    written   by    another      member    of   the   transition      team,\n\nconcluded that the cadets were qualified and recommended that the\n\nacademy be renewed.            In response, according to Lugo-González,\n\nSecretary Padín determined that he could not legally lay off the\n\ncadets. Rather than reconvening the academy, however, the DNER did\n\nnothing.       Although their initial six-month contracts had not been\n\nrenewed and their training had never been resumed, the plaintiffs\n\ncontinued to be employed as cadets and to assist the Rangers\n\nthroughout Puerto Rico. As Lugo-González explained the plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 5 -\n\fcontinued presence at the DNER, \"the Department had to use these\n\nRangers, they needed them.\"\n\n          In late October 2001, Secretary Salas-Quintana replaced\n\nSecretary Padín at the DNER after Padín resigned.   During a chance\n\nencounter in the DNER building, Salas-Quintana asked Lugo-González\n\nwhy Secretary Padín had not yet dismissed the cadets.     He added\n\nthat he viewed it as his responsibility as Secretary of the DNER to\n\ndismiss those \"Republicanos.\"2 To that end, Salas-Quintana created\n\na committee to once again review the plaintiffs' appointments.\n\nCabezudo was a member of that committee.     She testified that she\n\nreviewed the personnel file of every cadet.      As a result, each\n\nplaintiff received a letter in January 2002 stating that as of\n\nJanuary 15, 2002, his or her appointment would not be renewed for\n\nfailure to \"comply with the requirement of a[] psychological\n\nevaluation.\"   The plaintiffs heard Salas-Quintana say on a radio\n\nprogram that the cadets who had been dismissed would be reinstated\n\nif they could produce evidence that they had received psychological\n\nevaluations.   Despite submitting copies of their psychological\n\nevaluations at INSPIRA to the Human Resources Office of the DNER,\n\nthey were not returned to their positions.\n\n          Thirty-six cadets, the original plaintiffs, filed this\n\nsuit in federal district court on January 25, 2002 pursuant to 42\n\n\n     2\n       According to the record, \"Republicanos\" is a term used to\nrefer to members or sympathizers of the NPP, or those who are pro-\nstatehood.\n\n                              - 6 -\n\fU.S.C. § 1983 against Salas-Quintana, Cabezudo and Nieves in their\n\nindividual   and   official    capacities.   They   alleged   that   the\n\ndefendants violated their First Amendment rights by summarily\n\nterminating them due to their political affiliation, and violated\n\ntheir due process rights when they failed to give them notice or a\n\nhearing in connection with their termination.\n\n          After a trial, the jury found that Salas-Quintana and\n\nCabezudo had violated the rights of twenty-eight of the original\n\nthirty-six plaintiffs.3       According to the jury, seven plaintiffs\n\nhad experienced both political discrimination and a violation of\n\ntheir due process rights. The jury found that only the due process\n\nrights of an additional twenty-one plaintiffs had been violated.\n\nThe jury awarded $19,000 in punitive damages on the First Amendment\n\nclaim and $19,000 in compensatory damages on the due process claim\n\nto each of the seven plaintiffs who prevailed on both.         It also\n\nawarded $19,000 in compensatory damages to each of the twenty-one\n\nplaintiffs who prevailed on their due process claims.\n\n          The district court denied both the defendants' motion to\n\nset aside the verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) or for a\n\nnew trial under Fed R. Civ. P. 59, and the plaintiffs' request that\n\nthe court order their reinstatement.      Responding to a request made\n\n\n\n     3\n       The district court dismissed all claims against defendant\nNieves.   That determination has not been appealed.     The eight\noriginal plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed are not parties to\nthis appeal.\n\n                                  - 7 -\n\fby the plaintiffs immediately after the verdict, the district court\n\nawarded $1.00 in nominal damages as to each of the seven plaintiffs\n\nwho prevailed on their political discrimination claims because it\n\nfound that such an award was necessary to support the punitive\n\ndamages award on those claims.      This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            On a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a jury\n\nverdict may only be set aside if the court determines that \"'the\n\nevidence could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion.'\"\n\nAcevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting\n\nHiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte, 925 F.2d 10, 12 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991)).              In\n\nconducting our review, \"we do not evaluate the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses or weigh the evidence.\" Rodriguez-Marin, 438 F.3d at 75.\n\nOur review of the district court's denial of a motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law is de novo.          Mendez-Matos v. Municipality of\n\nGuaynabo, 557 F.3d 36, 56 (1st Cir. 2009).              We must determine\n\nwhether, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, a rational jury could have found in favor of the party\n\nthat prevailed.\" Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayagüez, 467 F.3d 16, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       Only if the facts and inferences \"point so\n\nstrongly    and   overwhelmingly   in     favor   of   the   movant   that    a\n\nreasonable jury could not have [returned the verdict]\" will we set\n\nit aside. Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66 (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\f            We review the district court's decision to deny the\n\ndefendants' motion for a new trial for clear abuse of discretion.\n\nAcevedo-Luis v. Pagán, 478 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2007).               The\n\ndistrict court, in turn, \"may grant such a motion only if 'the\n\nverdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that\n\nletting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.'\"         Id.\n\n(quoting Valentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla, 447 F.3d\n\n85, 104 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\n                                  III.\n\nA. First Amendment Claim\n\n            The First Amendment protects non-policymaking public\n\nemployees   from   adverse    employment   decisions   based   on   their\n\npolitical affiliation.       See Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d\n\n103, 110 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Rutan v. Repub. Party, 497 U.S.\n\n62, 75 (1990)).     The freedom to support a particular political\n\nparty is \"integral to the freedom of association and freedom of\n\npolitical expression that are protected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nWelch v. Ciampa, 542 F.3d 927, 939 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            In order to make out a case of political discrimination,\n\na plaintiff must adduce evidence permitting a rational jury \"to\n\nconclude that the challenged personnel action occurred and stemmed\n\nfrom a politically based discriminatory animus.\"       Rivera-Cotto v.\n\nRivera, 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir. 1994).        The plaintiff's case\n\nmust do more than simply juxtapose evidence of unfair treatment\n\n\n                                  - 9 -\n\fwith evidence that an employer's political affiliation differs from\n\nthe plaintiff's own.         Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez, 212\n\nF.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2000).         Instead, there must be evidence from\n\nwhich    a     jury    reasonably    may    infer    that     the   plaintiff's\n\nconstitutionally        protected     conduct     (in      this   instance,   an\n\naffiliation with the NPP) was a \"substantial or motivating factor\"\n\nbehind the plaintiff's discharge.           See Welch, 542 F.3d at 936.\n\n               In its defense, an employer may seek to discredit the\n\nplaintiff's evidence that there was an impermissible motive for his\n\nor her dismissal.       An employer may also defend against such a suit\n\nby producing \"enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's\n\ndismissal would have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons.\"       Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 67.         This affirmative defense\n\nrequires that an employer show by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat    it    would   have   taken   the   same   action    regardless   of   the\n\nplaintiff's political affiliation.             Mt. Healthy City School Dist.\n\nBd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977); Padilla-Garcia, 212\n\nF.3d at 77 (1st Cir. 2000).          An employer may successfully raise a\n\nMt. Healthy defense by establishing that the plaintiff's activity\n\nor status, although it may have been improperly considered, was not\n\nthe but for cause of the adverse employment action.               See Welch, 542\n\nF.3d at 941 (citing Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, 37 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).       It is the defendant's burden to \"persuade[] the factfinder\n\nthat its reason is credible.\"          Padilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at 77-78.\n\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\f           In reviewing the district court's denial of defendants'\n\nRule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, therefore, we\n\nwould find grounds for reversal only if: (1) the plaintiffs did not\n\nintroduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that the political animus was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor behind the firing, or (2) the record evidence compels the\n\nconclusion that the plaintiffs would have been dismissed even\n\nwithout any discriminatory animus that may have existed.                 See\n\nAcevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 67.\n\n           1. The plaintiffs' evidence of political discrimination\n\n           The plaintiffs presented ample evidence permitting a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that their dismissals were the result\n\nof discrimination.       The jury heard testimony at trial from the\n\nplaintiffs describing the anti-NPP environment at the DNER after\n\nthe elections.       As one cadet put it, after the new administration\n\nwas   elected   in    November   2000,   officers   in   the   Ranger   corps\n\ndiscussed how \"they were going to throw us out because we came in\n\nunder the administration of the New Progressive Party.\"             Another\n\ncadet explained that a senior officer told him in the presence of\n\nother agents \"that having them won, that we were going to leave.\n\nWe had a short time there.\"\n\n           The jury also heard testimony that this hostility towards\n\nthe NPP cadets permeated the PDP government to the extent that the\n\nleadership of the DNER was being pressured to fire the cadets well\n\n\n                                   - 11 -\n\fbefore Salas-Quintana took charge and made the decision to dismiss\n\nthem. Lugo-González, a legal advisor to Secretary Padín during the\n\ntransition from the NPP administration to the PDP in early 2001,\n\ntestified that one of the issues of major concern to the transition\n\ncommittee    was   the    training    academy   for    the   Ranger   cadets.\n\nSecretary Padín had told him \"that the Academy was not being\n\ncontinued    because     those   people   had   been   selected   under   the\n\nadministration of the New Progressive Party, and that is the only\n\nreason.     Because judicially and administrat[ively], the [c]adets\n\nwere qualified.\"4      Lugo-González testified that it was clear from\n\na meeting at the Governor's office he attended that the leadership\n\nof the PDP wanted the cadets to be laid off.           When he communicated\n\nthis desire to Padín, Padín refused to lay off the cadets because\n\n\"the only reason that they don't want to renew the Academy is\n\nbecause they had been appointed under the New Progressive Party\n\nAdministration.\"5\n\n            The plaintiffs introduced further testimony that both\n\nSalas-Quintana and Cabezudo were fully cognizant of the cadets'\n\npolitical affiliations.      Lugo-González recounted a conversation he\n\n\n\n     4\n       Although this testimony might have been excluded on hearsay\ngrounds, no such objection was made by the defendants.\n     5\n      Lugo-González made this statement as part of his response to\nthe question on direct examination, \"[w]as there any other source\nof pressure, concerning the appointment of the cadets?\" The\ndefendants' hearsay objection to this testimony was overruled at\ntrial and they have not pressed the issue on appeal.\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\fhad with Salas-Quintana in late October 2001 in which Salas-\n\nQuintana       referred   specifically     to   the   cadets'   political\n\naffiliations, announcing, \"I am going to lay all those republicanos\n\noff.\"       Lugo-González testified that Salas-Quintana told him, \"now\n\nthat I'm going to be the Secretary, it is my responsibility, my\n\nobligation, my determination, I am the one that is going to go\n\nahead and lay [the cadets] off.\"           One plaintiff testified that\n\nCabezudo, the Director of Human Resources, refused to give him a\n\ncopy of his personnel file after his termination, telling him that\n\nthe department \"is now under a new administration, under a new\n\npower,\" and that he should have made the request of \"the other\n\nsecretary who did belong to [his] party.\"6        Cabezudo also admitted\n\nthat she conducted a review of the cadets' files which, unlike the\n\nreview conducted under Secretary Padín, concluded that they were\n\nnot qualified because they had gone to the wrong testing center for\n\npsychological testing.       She also oversaw the preparation of the\n\nletters informing the plaintiffs that they had been fired.7\n\n\n        6\n      Although Cabezudo denied ever meeting any of the plaintiffs,\nthe jury was free to make the credibility determination favoring\nthe plaintiffs.\n        7\n       The defendants contend that the plaintiffs' showing of a\npolitical motive for the plaintiffs' firings is undercut by\nevidence that some of the cadets who were dismissed were members of\nthe PDP, while others who were not dismissed were members of the\nNPP. The defendants direct us to no evidence in support of the\nformer claim.    The defendants direct us to only one page of\ntestimony in support of the latter contention.      That testimony\nseems to suggest that two cadets who were not fired along with the\nmajority of the class may have been NPP members. Another portion\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\f              In   short,   based    on   the    totality    of     the   evidence\n\ndescribing      the   events    leading   up    to   the   plaintiffs'     firing,\n\nincluding the actions and statements of Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo\n\nthemselves, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the\n\ndefendants shared the prevailing sentiment among PDP officials that\n\nthe cadets should be fired because of their alliance with the NPP,\n\nand acted accordingly.8\n\n              2. The Mt. Healthy defense\n\n              Defendants    assert   on   appeal      that   they    successfully\n\ndeveloped their Mt. Healthy defense at trial by establishing, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that they would have taken the same\n\naction regardless of the plaintiffs' political affiliation with the\n\nNPP.       They contend that the plaintiffs were dismissed from their\n\npositions      because   they   either    did   not   complete      psychological\n\nevaluations or their evaluations were administered by INSPIRA,\n\n\n\n\nof the testimony, however, indicates that both of those cadets\n\"were also dismissed\" at a later date. Taken in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict, the additional information that two NPP\ncadets were fired later than the plaintiffs does not suggest that\nthe jury was unreasonable in its conclusion that seven of the\nplaintiffs were fired because of their political affiliation.\n       8\n       The defendants introduce no additional arguments in support\nof their claim that they were entitled to a new trial beyond their\nassertion that the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the\nevidence.    As described above, the evidence supporting the\npolitical discrimination claim was more than sufficient to support\nthe verdict. The district court did not abuse its discretion when\nit denied the motion for a new trial.\n\n                                     - 14 -\n\fwhose contract with the DNER provided for other psychiatric and\n\npsychological services, but not for testing.\n\n             The defendants did present evidence at trial that the\n\ncontract     with    INSPIRA      did   not   cover      psychiatric    and/or\n\npsychological testing, whereas a contract with another provider,\n\nCarribean Medical Testing, did provide for such testing.               Cabezudo\n\nalso testified that she wrote a report at Salas-Quintana's behest\n\nin   which   she    identified    those   cadets   who    had   psychological\n\nevaluations from INSPIRA as unqualified for their positions.\n\n             To rebut that defense, the plaintiffs presented evidence\n\nfrom José R. Rodríguez-Rosado, who was hired to coordinate the drug\n\nand psychiatric testing for the cadets in 2000.             Rosado testified\n\nthat INSPIRA was chosen by Secretary Pagán, the PDP Secretary who\n\npreceded Salas-Quintana, and the Comptroller to conduct the tests\n\nbecause it submitted the lowest price estimate.             Rosado explained\n\nthat the DNER requested that INSPIRA evaluate the candidates for\n\nRanger   cadets     and   that,    accordingly,    INSPIRA      performed   the\n\nevaluations.    The plaintiffs corroborated this account, testifying\n\nthat they were sent to INSPIRA by the DNER for the necessary\n\npsychological evaluations.          The plaintiffs' INSPIRA evaluations\n\nthemselves were introduced into evidence.\n\n             Hearing this evidence, a reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded that the INSPIRA evaluations were precisely the tests\n\nthat were required by the DNER in accordance with the Ranger bylaws\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fand that the defendants' claim otherwise was a pretext for the\n\nunlawful firing of the plaintiffs.    It was the jury's prerogative,\n\nafter hearing the conflicting accounts of the INSPIRA evaluations,\n\nto find that political affiliation, not the use of the wrong\n\npsychological testing center, was the \"but-for\" cause of the\n\nplaintiffs' dismissal.    The evidence did not compel the jury to\n\nfind that the defendants were entitled to prevail on their Mt.\n\nHealthy defense as a matter of law.\n\nB. Due Process and Qualified Immunity\n\n          The defendants argue that no reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that the plaintiffs' due process rights had been violated\n\nbecause they did not have an entitlement to retain their positions\n\nas cadets.    Without such an entitlement, the plaintiffs would not\n\nhave a valid claim under the due process clause, which only\n\nprotects government employees who have a property interest in\n\ncontinued employment. Costa-Urena v. Segarra, 590 F.3d 18, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).   We need not reach the merits of this property interest\n\nargument because the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity\n\nfrom suit on the due process claim.9\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Although the district court did not address this qualified\nimmunity claim in its opinion denying the defendants' motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, the defendants raised their claim of\nqualified immunity in both their 50(a) and 50(b) motions as well as\non appeal. Thus, it is properly before us. We review the implicit\ndenial of qualified immunity de novo. Rodríguez-Marín, 438 F.3d at\n84.\n\n                               - 16 -\n\f           Qualified immunity protects government officials \"from\n\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\n\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\"    Pearson v. Callahan,\n\n129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThe qualified immunity analysis has two parts. A court must decide\n\nwhether the facts shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a\n\nconstitutional   right   and   whether   the   right   was    \"clearly\n\nestablished\" at the time of the alleged violation by the defendant.\n\nId. at 815-16; Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).10\n\n           Supreme Court doctrine had required that we begin our\n\nqualified immunity analysis by determining whether the plaintiff\n\nhas shown a constitutional violation.     See Saucier v. Katz, 533\n\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001) (holding that a court considering qualified\n\nimmunity must decide, as a \"threshold question,\" whether the facts\n\nalleged show the violation of a constitutional right).       Recently,\n\nhowever, the Court relaxed that requirement, allowing us to bypass\n\nthe initial step in certain circumstances. See Pearson, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 818-19; Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 270.    The Court agreed that the\n\n\n\n     10\n        The district court erroneously submitted the question of\nqualified immunity to the jury. Whether defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity \"is a legal question for the court to decide.\"\nRodríguez-Marín, 438 F.3d at 83. The jury's role is to \"determine\nany preliminary factual questions\" so that the court can determine\nthe \"legal issue of the official's reasonableness.\" Id. at 83-84.\n\n                               - 17 -\n\funderlying principle of \"encouraging federal courts to decide\n\nunclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future\n\n'is   not   meaningfully     advanced     .   .   .   when   the   definition   of\n\nconstitutional      rights    depends    on   a   federal    court's   uncertain\n\nassumptions about state law.'\"           Pearson, 129 S.Ct. at 819 (quoting\n\nEgolf v. Witmer, 526 F.3d 104, 109-111 (3d Cir. 2008)).                This is a\n\ncase in which any conclusions we might draw about the relevant\n\nCommonwealth law would be uncertain at best.                   Moreover, as we\n\nexplain below, that very uncertainty is critical to our analysis of\n\nthe clearly established prong of the qualified immunity doctrine.\n\n            Property interests subject to due process protection are\n\ndelineated \"by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\n\nindependent source such as state law.\"            Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408\n\nU.S. 564, 577 (1972).        In order to create a property interest, that\n\nindependent source must \"give the individual a legitimate claim of\n\nentitlement    to   some     sort   of   benefit.\"       Hatfield-Bermudez      v.\n\nAldanondo-Rivera, 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir. 2007).                   Whether the\n\nplaintiffs had a clearly-established property interest in their\n\nemployment as cadets is therefore a question of Puerto Rico law.\n\nSee Costa-Urena, 590 F.3d at 27.\n\n            The law is \"clearly established\" if courts have ruled\n\nthat \"materially similar conduct was unconstitutional,\" or if there\n\nis a previously identified general constitutional principle that\n\napplies \"with obvious clarity to the specific conduct at issue.\"\n\n\n                                     - 18 -\n\fJennings v. Jones, 499 F.3d 2, 16 (1st Cir. 2007).                              In other\n\nwords, a right is clearly established if a reasonable official is\n\non clear notice that what he or she is doing was unconstitutional.\n\nCosta-Urena, 590 F.3d at 29.            It was the plaintiffs' burden to\n\ndemonstrate that the law was clearly established in early 2002,\n\nwhen the termination took place.            See Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S.\n\n183, 197 (1984); Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 13 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           As    we    have   had    occasion       to    observe    in     the    past,\n\ntranslated Puerto Rico law is both sparse and contradictory on the\n\nquestion of the property interest in continued employment of\n\ntransitory government employees. Hatfield-Bermudez, 496 F.3d at 60\n\n(noting that \"it is not entirely clear\" what the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme   Court's      current   position      is    on    whether     a    non-career\n\ngovernment employee has a legitimate expectation of permanent\n\nemployment).     The plaintiffs cite two cases on point available to\n\nus in English translation.           The plaintiffs do not cite or provide\n\nany additional cases on the question, nor has our independent\n\nresearch revealed any additional translated cases.\n\n           In the earlier of the two available opinions, the Puerto\n\nRico   Supreme    Court       \"indicated    that         there   may       be    certain\n\ncircumstances     in    which    a    transitory         employee    could       have   a\n\nlegitimate expectancy of contract renewal.\" Id. at 60 (emphasis in\n\noriginal)(citing Lupiáñez de González v. Cruz, 5 P.R. Offic. Trans.\n\n966 (1977) (finding that a non-career employee who had been told\n\n\n                                      - 19 -\n\fthat a permanent position was being created for her had a right to\n\ndue process before being terminated)). In the latter of the cases,\n\nhowever, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that a \"transitory\n\nemployee\" has \"a job retention expectancy only during the term of\n\nthe appointment.\"    Dep't of Natural Res. v. Correa, 18 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 795, 804 (1987).       The Court stated that \"[a] person who has\n\na transitory appointment, knowing that it expires at the end of the\n\nperiod for which it is given, cannot validly claim that he had a\n\nreal expectancy that this type of appointment would offer him a\n\npermanent job status or the right to have the same constantly\n\nrenewed.\"    Id. at 806.\n\n            In the face of two cases that seem to give opposing\n\nanswers to the question whether a transitory government employee\n\nhas   an   entitlement   to   his   or   her   continued   employment,   the\n\nplaintiffs do not explain how the law clearly established that\n\nconduct \"materially similar\" to that of the defendants in this case\n\nwas unconstitutional at the time the plaintiffs were fired.11            The\n\nplaintiffs were hired under bylaws that required that they receive\n\ntraining, and the successful completion of that training would\n\nresult in their becoming non-transitory employees.12         However, they\n\n\n      11\n        There may be additional relevant cases, but the plaintiffs\nhave not cited them nor have we been provided with translations.\n      12\n       There was a factual dispute at trial over the implications\nof the Ranger bylaws. \"When, as here, the defendants appeal from\na denial of qualified immunity after a jury verdict has been\nrendered, the evidence is construed in the light most hospitable to\n\n                                    - 20 -\n\fwere also indisputably transitory employees whose term had expired\n\nwhen they were discharged.          Thus, their circumstances could be\n\nanalogized either to Lupiáñez or Correa.        We are unable to say that\n\none   case   or   the   other   clearly   governs.     Qualified   immunity,\n\ntherefore, shielded the defendants from the due process claims of\n\nthe plaintiffs.13\n\n                                     IV.\n\n             Although the defendants do not contest on appeal the\n\njury's award of damages (thereby relying for success on their\n\nchallenges to liability), we must say a few words about the damages\n\nawards to avoid any misunderstanding about the effect of our\n\nliability determinations on those awards.            First, we note that the\n\ndistrict court did not have to award $1.00 in nominal damages to\n\nvalidate the jury's award of punitive damages for the violation of\n\n\n\nthe party that prevailed at trial, and deference is accorded the\njury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.\"\nGuillemard-Ginorio, 585 F.3d at 525 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). We therefore read the cadet bylaws to support\nthe proposition that the cadets would become Rangers so long as\ntheir training was successfully completed.\n      13\n        The defendants also argue that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity from suit on the political discrimination claim.\nThey provide no support for that argument, beyond the claim that\nthe evidence was \"insufficient to establish Plaintiffs' prima facie\ncase.\"   Having determined that the jury reasonably found that\nSalas-Quintana and Cabezudo were motivated by political animus when\nthey fired the cadets, we need not tarry long over this claim.\n\"[I]t is clearly established, and was at the time of the events in\nquestion, that terminating a non-policy-making employee based on\npolitical affiliation violates the First Amendment.\" Costa-Urena,\n590 F.3d at 21.\n\n                                    - 21 -\n\fthe First Amendment rights of seven of the plaintiffs.     We have\n\nrecently determined that in a section 1983 action, a jury may\n\nproperly award punitive damages even if it awards no nominal or\n\ncompensatory damages.   De Jesús Nazario v. Morris Rodríguez, 554\n\nF.3d 196, 205 (1st Cir. 2009).14       Nevertheless, as noted, the\n\nnominal damages award for the First Amendment violations are\n\nunchallenged and we see no reason to disturb them.15\n\n          Second, because of our conclusion that the defendants\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claims, we\n\n\n     14\n       The district court did not have the benefit of our recent\ndecision in De Jesús Nazario, in which we held definitively that\nour earlier holding in Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, 69 F.3d\n1205 (1st Cir. 1995), on which the district court relied, did not\napply to section 1983 actions. De Jesús Nazario, 554 F.3d at 205.\n     15\n        Nominal damages are available in a § 1983 action for the\nviolation of a procedural due process right even without a\ncorollary finding of injury or an award of compensatory damages.\nCarey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978). Several circuits have\nheld that, \"although the Supreme Court's decision in Carey involved\nnominal damages after a procedural due process violation, nominal\ndamages are similarly appropriate in the context of a First\nAmendment violation.\" KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, 465\nF.3d 1256, 1261 (11th Cir. 2006); see also Familias Unidas v.\nBriscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 402 (5th Cir. 1980) (nominal damages for\nviolation of First Amendment rights); Draper v. Combs, 792 F.2d\n915, 921-22 (9th Cir. 1986) (nominal damages for violation of\neither procedural or substantive constitutional right); Risdal v.\nHalford, 209 F.3d 1071, 1072 (8th Cir. 2000) (nominal damages for\nFirst Amendment rights). Given the absence of a challenge to the\nnominal damages award, we see no need to address the merits of that\nquestion here. Procedurally, if a jury in a case brought pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983 finds a violation of the plaintiff's\nconstitutional rights, but fails to award compensatory damages, a\nplaintiff \"may ask the trial court for nominal damages on the\noccasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\"\nCampos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 98-99 (1st Cir. 1999). Such\na procedure was followed in this case.\n\n                              - 22 -\n\fmust vacate the jury's award of compensatory damages to the twenty-\n\neight prevailing plaintiffs for the violation of their rights under\n\nthe due process clause.16             We affirm the award of punitive and\n\nnominal damages to the seven plaintiffs whose First Amendment\n\nrights were violated.17\n\n                                         V.\n\n                  For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court on the political discrimination claims, and the\n\naward        of   nominal   and   punitive   damages   to   the   plaintiffs   who\n\nprevailed on their political discrimination claims.                We vacate the\n\njudgment on the due process claims of all plaintiffs and the award\n\n\n\n\n        16\n        Since the injury in this case for a due process violation\nand a First Amendment violation would seem to be the same - the\nloss of a job - it does seem odd that the jury awarded compensatory\ndamages on the due process claim but not on the First Amendment\nclaim.   The district court speculated that the jury might have\nchosen that outcome because of the court's admonition in its\ninstructions that the jury could not award double damages for the\nsame injury. With a properly structured verdict form, the jury\nmight have been able to indicate an award of compensatory damages\nfor the First Amendment claim and the due process claim without\nviolating the rule on double damages. However, such a verdict form\nwas not submitted to the jury.\n     17\n        The requirement for an award of punitive damages in an\naction pursuant to § 1983 is rigorous.        See Méndez-Matos v.\nMunicipality of Guaynabo, 557 F.3d 36, 48 (1st Cir. 2009) (holding\npunitive damages cannot be assessed in an action under § 1983\nunless the plaintiff proves that the \"defendant 'discriminate[d] in\nthe face of a perceived risk that its actions [would] violate\nfederal law'\") (quoting Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526,\n536 (1999)). As noted, however, the appellants did not argue on\nappeal that this requirement was not met.\n\n                                       - 23 -\n\fof compensatory damages based on the due process claims. Each side\n\nshall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                             - 24 -\n\f",

González-Magaz, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, BALDOCK,<sup>[*]</sup> and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This political discrimination lawsuit was filed in January 2002 by thirty-six former Ranger cadets of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (\"DNER\") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The cadets alleged that they were summarily terminated due to their political affiliation with the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), in violation of their First Amendment rights, and without notice or a hearing, in violation of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. They sued three defendants, Salvador Salas-Quintana, the Secretary of the DNER at the time of their termination, Lourdes Cabezudo, the Director of Human Resources for the DNER, and Francis Nieves, Special Assistant to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>Twenty-eight of the plaintiffs convinced a jury that their due process rights had been violated by defendants Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo. The jury also determined that seven of those twenty-eight plaintiffs had experienced political discrimination. The jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $19,000 to each of the twenty-eight plaintiffs for the violation of their due process rights. In addition, the jury awarded $19,000 in punitive damages to each of the seven plaintiffs for the violation of their First Amendment rights. The defendants then moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial; the plaintiffs moved for reinstatement to their positions. The district court denied both motions. Defendants Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo (\"the defendants\") now appeal the district court's denials of their post-trial motions.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Because we find that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim, we vacate the jury's finding of a due process violation and the related award of compensatory damages. We affirm the jury's finding of a First Amendment violation and the award of nominal and punitive damages for that violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recite some of the relevant facts here in the light most favorable to the verdict for the purpose of background. <i>Omnipoint Holdings, Inc. v. City of Cranston,</i> 586 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.2009). We provide more details when analyzing the claims of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>This case, not surprisingly, arises from events following the general elections held in Puerto Rico on November 8, 2000 which resulted in the election of a new governor. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir.2006). Unlike the previous governor, who had been a member of the NPP, the new governor was a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). In January of 2001, a new secretary, Carlos Padín, was appointed by the new PDP administration to head the DNER.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the election, in August of 2000, the DNER published a job announcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> seeking cadets for its Ranger Corps. The Ranger Corps is a law enforcement body whose mission is to protect the environment in Puerto Rico. Rangers are trained in environmental protection. They carry guns and must receive specialized firearms training. Whereas Rangers are so-called \"regular employees\" under the Puerto Rico government's classification system, cadets are \"transitory employees.\" A cadet becomes a Ranger by meeting certain physical requirements, passing psychological exams, and successfully completing a training program which is provided by the DNER after the cadets are hired.</p>\n<p>The twenty-eight remaining plaintiffs in this case (\"the plaintiffs\") were all hired in late August and early September 2000 after responding to the August 2000 announcement seeking cadets. They were all members of the NPP, hired by the Secretary of the DNER under the NPP administration. As part of the hiring process, the plaintiffs were sent by the DNER to receive psychological testing at INSPIRA, a mental health testing facility. All of the plaintiffs received favorable evaluations. When the new PDP administration was elected in November 2000, the cadets had not yet been trained as Rangers. In December 2000, they were sent to a specially-convened training academy, but the academy was suspended after only a week. Although the cadets were told that their training would resume after the holidays, the training academy was never reconvened.</p>\n<p>Instead, under Secretary Padín, the DNER waffled about the fate of the cadets and whether to resume the training academy, which had been scheduled to reconvene on January 9, 2001. In early 2001, the Secretary asked Ferdinand Lugo-González, the legal advisor to the transition team, to conduct a review of all of the cadets' files, with a specific focus on whether the cadet had or had not been administered the requisite psychiatric and psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p>Lugo-González testified that the review was conducted because Secretary Padín was being pressured by the PDP leadership to fire the cadets who had been appointed under the NPP administration. According to Lugo-González, the resulting report, which was written by another member of the transition team, concluded that the cadets were qualified and recommended that the academy be renewed. In response, according to Lugo-González, Secretary Padín determined that he could not legally lay off the cadets. Rather than reconvening the academy, however, the DNER did nothing. Although their initial six-month contracts had not been renewed and their training had never been resumed, the plaintiffs continued to be employed as cadets and to assist the Rangers throughout Puerto Rico. As Lugo-González explained the plaintiffs' continued presence at the DNER, \"the Department had to use these Rangers, they needed them.\"</p>\n<p>In late October 2001, Secretary Salas-Quintana replaced Secretary Padín at the DNER after Padín resigned. During a chance encounter in the DNER building, Salas-Quintana asked Lugo-González why Secretary Padín had not yet dismissed the cadets. He added that he viewed it as his responsibility as Secretary of the DNER to dismiss those \"Republicanos.\"<sup>[2]</sup> To that end, Salas-Quintana created a committee to once again review the plaintiffs' appointments. Cabezudo was a member of that committee. She testified that she reviewed the personnel file of every cadet. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> As a result, each plaintiff received a letter in January 2002 stating that as of January 15, 2002, his or her appointment would not be renewed for failure to \"comply with the requirement of a[ ] psychological evaluation.\" The plaintiffs heard Salas-Quintana say on a radio program that the cadets who had been dismissed would be reinstated if they could produce evidence that they had received psychological evaluations. Despite submitting copies of their psychological evaluations at INSPIRA to the Human Resources Office of the DNER, they were not returned to their positions.</p>\n<p>Thirty-six cadets, the original plaintiffs, filed this suit in federal district court on January 25, 2002 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Salas-Quintana, Cabezudo and Nieves in their individual and official capacities. They alleged that the defendants violated their First Amendment rights by summarily terminating them due to their political affiliation, and violated their due process rights when they failed to give them notice or a hearing in connection with their termination.</p>\n<p>After a trial, the jury found that Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo had violated the rights of twenty-eight of the original thirty-six plaintiffs.<sup>[3]</sup> According to the jury, seven plaintiffs had experienced both political discrimination and a violation of their due process rights. The jury found that only the due process rights of an additional twenty-one plaintiffs had been violated. The jury awarded $19,000 in punitive damages on the First Amendment claim and $19,000 in compensatory damages on the due process claim to each of the seven plaintiffs who prevailed on both. It also awarded $19,000 in compensatory damages to each of the twenty-one plaintiffs who prevailed on their due process claims.</p>\n<p>The district court denied both the defendants' motion to set aside the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) or for a new trial under Fed R. Civ. P. 59, and the plaintiffs' request that the court order their reinstatement. Responding to a request made by the plaintiffs immediately after the verdict, the district court awarded $1.00 in nominal damages as to each of the seven plaintiffs who prevailed on their political discrimination claims because it found that such an award was necessary to support the punitive damages award on those claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a jury verdict may only be set aside if the court determines that \"`the evidence could lead a reasonable person to <i>only one conclusion.</i>'\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz v.

In conducting our review, \"we do not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses or weigh the evidence.\" <i>Rodriguez-Marin,</i> 438 F.3d at 75.

Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> 447 F.3d 85, 104 (1st Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. First Amendment Claim</h2>\n<p>The First Amendment protects non-policymaking public employees from adverse employment decisions based on their political affiliation. <i>See </i><i>Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 110 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>Rutan v. Repub. Party,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 75, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990)). The freedom to support a particular political party is \"integral to the freedom of association and freedom of political expression that are protected by the First Amendment.\" <i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> 542 F.3d 927, 939 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In order to make out a case of political discrimination, a plaintiff must adduce evidence permitting a rational jury \"to conclude that the challenged personnel action occurred and stemmed from a politically based discriminatory animus.\" <i>Rivera-Cotto v. Rivera,</i> 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir.1994). The plaintiff's case must do more than simply juxtapose evidence of unfair treatment with evidence that an employer's political affiliation differs from the plaintiff's own. <i>Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2000). Instead, there must be evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that the plaintiff's constitutionally protected conduct (in this instance, an affiliation with the NPP) was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" behind the plaintiff's discharge. <i>See </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 936.</p>\n<p>In its defense, an employer may seek to discredit the plaintiff's evidence that there was an impermissible motive for his or her dismissal. An employer may also defend against such a suit by producing \"enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's dismissal would have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 67. This affirmative defense requires that an employer show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff's political affiliation. <i>Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 77 (1st Cir.2000). An employer may successfully raise a <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense by establishing that the plaintiff's activity or status, although it may have been improperly considered, was not the but for cause of the adverse employment action. <i>See </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 941 (citing <i>Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait,</i> 37 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994)). It is the defendant's burden to \"persuade[ ] the factfinder that its reason is credible.\" <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 77-78.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the district court's denial of defendants' Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, therefore, we would find grounds for reversal only if: (1) the plaintiffs did not introduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the political animus was a substantial or motivating factor behind the firing, or (2) the record evidence compels the conclusion that the plaintiffs would have been dismissed even without any discriminatory animus that may have existed. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 67.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> 1. The plaintiffs' evidence of political discrimination</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs presented ample evidence permitting a reasonable jury to conclude that their dismissals were the result of discrimination. The jury heard testimony at trial from the plaintiffs describing the anti-NPP environment at the DNER after the elections. As one cadet put it, after the new administration was elected in November 2000, officers in the Ranger corps discussed how \"they were going to throw us out because we came in under the administration of the New Progressive Party.\" Another cadet explained that a senior officer told him in the presence of other agents \"that having them won, that we were going to leave. We had a short time there.\"</p>\n<p>The jury also heard testimony that this hostility towards the NPP cadets permeated the PDP government to the extent that the leadership of the DNER was being pressured to fire the cadets well before Salas-Quintana took charge and made the decision to dismiss them. Lugo-González, a legal advisor to Secretary Padín during the transition from the NPP administration to the PDP in early 2001, testified that one of the issues of major concern to the transition committee was the training academy for the Ranger cadets. Secretary Padín had told him \"that the Academy was not being continued because those people had been selected under the administration of the New Progressive Party, and that is the only reason. Because judicially and administrat[ively], the [c]adets were qualified.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Lugo-González testified that it was clear from a meeting at the Governor's office he attended that the leadership of the PDP wanted the cadets to be laid off. When he communicated this desire to Padín, Padín refused to lay off the cadets because \"the only reason that they don't want to renew the Academy is because they had been appointed under the New Progressive Party Administration.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs introduced further testimony that both Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo were fully cognizant of the cadets' political affiliations. Lugo-González recounted a conversation he had with Salas-Quintana in late October 2001 in which Salas-Quintana referred specifically to the cadets' political affiliations, announcing, \"I am going to lay all those republicanos off.\" Lugo-González testified that Salas-Quintana told him, \"now that I'm going to be the Secretary, it is my responsibility, my obligation, my determination, I am the one that is going to go ahead and lay [the cadets] off.\" One plaintiff testified that Cabezudo, the Director of Human Resources, refused to give him a copy of his personnel file after his termination, telling him that the department \"is now under a new administration, under a new power,\" and that he should have made the request of \"the other secretary who did belong to [his] party.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Cabezudo also admitted that she conducted a review of the cadets' files which, unlike the review conducted under Secretary Padín, concluded that they were not qualified because they had gone to the wrong testing center for psychological <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> testing. She also oversaw the preparation of the letters informing the plaintiffs that they had been fired.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In short, based on the totality of the evidence describing the events leading up to the plaintiffs' firing, including the actions and statements of Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo themselves, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendants shared the prevailing sentiment among PDP officials that the cadets should be fired because of their alliance with the NPP, and acted accordingly.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense</h2>\n<p>Defendants assert on appeal that they successfully developed their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense at trial by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiffs' political affiliation with the NPP. They contend that the plaintiffs were dismissed from their positions because they either did not complete psychological evaluations or their evaluations were administered by INSPIRA, whose contract with the DNER provided for other psychiatric and psychological services, but not for testing.</p>\n<p>The defendants did present evidence at trial that the contract with INSPIRA did not cover psychiatric and/or psychological testing, whereas a contract with another provider, Carribean Medical Testing, did provide for such testing. Cabezudo also testified that she wrote a report at Salas-Quintana's behest in which she identified those cadets who had psychological evaluations from INSPIRA as unqualified for their positions.</p>\n<p>To rebut that defense, the plaintiffs presented evidence from José R. Rodríguez-Rosado, who was hired to coordinate the drug and psychiatric testing for the cadets in 2000. Rosado testified that INSPIRA was chosen by Secretary Pagán, the PDP Secretary who preceded Salas-Quintana, and the Comptroller to conduct the tests because it submitted the lowest price estimate. Rosado explained that the DNER requested that INSPIRA evaluate the candidates for Ranger cadets and that, accordingly, INSPIRA performed the evaluations. The plaintiffs corroborated this account, testifying that they were sent to INSPIRA by the DNER for the necessary psychological evaluations. The plaintiffs' INSPIRA evaluations themselves were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>Hearing this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that the INSPIRA evaluations were precisely the tests that were required by the DNER in accordance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> with the Ranger bylaws and that the defendants' claim otherwise was a pretext for the unlawful firing of the plaintiffs. It was the jury's prerogative, after hearing the conflicting accounts of the INSPIRA evaluations, to find that political affiliation, not the use of the wrong psychological testing center, was the \"but-for\" cause of the plaintiffs' dismissal. The evidence did not compel the jury to find that the defendants were entitled to prevail on their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Due Process and Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>The defendants argue that no reasonable jury could have found that the plaintiffs' due process rights had been violated because they did not have an entitlement to retain their positions as cadets. Without such an entitlement, the plaintiffs would not have a valid claim under the due process clause, which only protects government employees who have a property interest in continued employment. <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> 590 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.2009). We need not reach the merits of this property interest argument because the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from suit on the due process claim.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Qualified immunity protects government officials \"from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The qualified immunity analysis has two parts. A court must decide whether the facts shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violation by the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 815-16; <i>Maldonado v. Fontanes,</i> 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir.2009).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Supreme Court doctrine had required that we begin our qualified immunity analysis by determining whether the plaintiff has shown a constitutional violation. <i>See </i><i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (holding that a court considering qualified immunity must decide, as a \"threshold question,\" whether the facts alleged show the violation of a constitutional right). Recently, however, the Court relaxed that requirement, allowing us to bypass the initial step in certain circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 818-19; <i>Maldonado,</i> 568 F.3d at 270. The Court agreed that the underlying principle of \"encouraging federal courts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future `is not meaningfully advanced ... when the definition of constitutional rights depends on a federal court's uncertain assumptions about state law.'\" <i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 819 (quoting <i>Egolf v. Witmer,</i> 526 F.3d 104, 109-111 (3d Cir.2008)). This is a case in which any conclusions we might draw about the relevant Commonwealth law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> would be uncertain at best. Moreover, as we explain below, that very uncertainty is critical to our analysis of the clearly established prong of the qualified immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p>Property interests subject to due process protection are delineated \"by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). In order to create a property interest, that independent source must \"give the individual a legitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.\" <i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir.2007). Whether the plaintiffs had a clearly-established property interest in their employment as cadets is therefore a question of Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p>The law is \"clearly established\" if courts have ruled that \"materially similar conduct was unconstitutional,\" or if there is a previously identified general constitutional principle that applies \"with obvious clarity to the specific conduct at issue.\" <i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 499 F.3d 2, 16 (1st Cir.2007). In other words, a right is clearly established if a reasonable official is on clear notice that what he or she is doing was unconstitutional. <i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 29. It was the plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate that the law was clearly established in early 2002, when the termination took place. <i>See </i><i>Davis v. Scherer,</i> 468 U.S. 183, 197, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984); <i>Horta v. Sullivan,</i> 4 F.3d 2, 13 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>As we have had occasion to observe in the past, translated Puerto Rico law is both sparse and contradictory on the question of the property interest in continued employment of transitory government employees. <i>Hatfield-Bermudez,</i> 496 F.3d at 60 (noting that \"it is not entirely clear\" what the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's current position is on whether a non-career government employee has a legitimate expectation of permanent employment). The plaintiffs cite two cases on point available to us in English translation. The plaintiffs do not cite or provide any additional cases on the question, nor has our independent research revealed any additional translated cases.</p>\n<p>In the earlier of the two available opinions, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court \"indicated that there may be certain circumstances in which a transitory employee <i>could</i> have a legitimate expectancy of contract renewal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60 (emphasis in original)(citing <i>Lupiánez de González v. Cruz,</i> 5 P.R. Offic. Trans. 966, 1977 WL 50866 (1977) (finding that a non-career employee who had been told that a permanent position was being created for her had a right to due process before being terminated)). In the latter of the cases, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that a \"transitory employee\" has \"a job retention expectancy <i>only</i> during the term of the appointment.\" <i>Departamento de Recursos Naturales v. Correa,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 795, 804, 1987 WL 448329 (1987). The Court stated that \"[a] person who has a transitory appointment, knowing that it expires at the end of the period for which it is given, cannot validly claim that he had a real expectancy that this type of appointment would offer him a permanent job status or the right to have the same constantly renewed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 806, 1987 WL 448329.</p>\n<p>In the face of two cases that seem to give opposing answers to the question whether a transitory government employee has an entitlement to his or her continued employment, the plaintiffs do not explain how the law clearly established that conduct \"materially similar\" to that of the defendants in this case was unconstitutional at the time the plaintiffs were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> fired.<sup>[11]</sup> The plaintiffs were hired under bylaws that required that they receive training, and the successful completion of that training would result in their becoming non-transitory employees.<sup>[12]</sup> However, they were also indisputably transitory employees whose term had expired when they were discharged. Thus, their circumstances could be analogized either to <i>Lupiáñez</i> or <i>Correa.</i> We are unable to say that one case or the other clearly governs. Qualified immunity, therefore, shielded the defendants from the due process claims of the plaintiffs.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Although the defendants do not contest on appeal the jury's award of damages (thereby relying for success on their challenges to liability), we must say a few words about the damages awards to avoid any misunderstanding about the effect of our liability determinations on those awards. First, we note that the district court did not have to award $1.00 in nominal damages to validate the jury's award of punitive damages for the violation of the First Amendment rights of seven of the plaintiffs. We have recently determined that in a section 1983 action, a jury may properly award punitive damages even if it awards no nominal or compensatory damages. <i>De Jesús Nazario v. Morris Rodríguez,</i> 554 F.3d 196, 205 (1st Cir.2009).<sup>[14]</sup> Nevertheless, as noted, the nominal damages award for the First Amendment violations are unchallenged and we see no reason to disturb them.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, because of our conclusion that the defendants were entitled to qualified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> immunity on the due process claims, we must vacate the jury's award of compensatory damages to the twenty-eight prevailing plaintiffs for the violation of their rights under the due process clause.<sup>[16]</sup> We affirm the award of punitive and nominal damages to the seven plaintiffs whose First Amendment rights were violated.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>For the aforementioned reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court on the political discrimination claims, and the award of nominal and punitive damages to the plaintiffs who prevailed on their political discrimination claims. We <i>vacate</i> the judgment on the due process claims of all plaintiffs and the award of compensatory damages based on the due process claims. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiffs have not appealed the denial of their request for reinstatement.</p>\n<p>[2]  According to the record, \"Republicanos\" is a term used to refer to members or sympathizers of the NPP, or those who are pro-statehood.</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court dismissed all claims against defendant Nieves. That determination has not been appealed. The eight original plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although this testimony might have been excluded on hearsay grounds, no such objection was made by the defendants.</p>\n<p>[5]  Lugo-González made this statement as part of his response to the question on direct examination, \"[w]as there any other source of pressure, concerning the appointment of the cadets?\" The defendants' hearsay objection to this testimony was overruled at trial and they have not pressed the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although Cabezudo denied ever meeting any of the plaintiffs, the jury was free to make the credibility determination favoring the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>[7]  The defendants contend that the plaintiffs' showing of a political motive for the plaintiffs' firings is undercut by evidence that some of the cadets who were dismissed were members of the PDP, while others who were not dismissed were members of the NPP. The defendants direct us to no evidence in support of the former claim. The defendants direct us to only one page of testimony in support of the latter contention. That testimony seems to suggest that two cadets who were not fired along with the majority of the class may have been NPP members. Another portion of the testimony, however, indicates that both of those cadets \"were also dismissed\" at a later date. Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, the additional information that two NPP cadets were fired later than the plaintiffs does not suggest that the jury was unreasonable in its conclusion that seven of the plaintiffs were fired because of their political affiliation.</p>\n<p>[8]  The defendants introduce no additional arguments in support of their claim that they were entitled to a new trial beyond their assertion that the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence. As described above, the evidence supporting the political discrimination claim was more than sufficient to support the verdict. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>[9]  Although the district court did not address this qualified immunity claim in its opinion denying the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, the defendants raised their claim of qualified immunity in both their 50(a) and 50(b) motions as well as on appeal. Thus, it is properly before us. We review the implicit denial of qualified immunity <i>de novo. </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín,</i> 438 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p>[10]  The district court erroneously submitted the question of qualified immunity to the jury. Whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity \"is a legal question for the court to decide.\" <i>Rodríguez-Marín,</i> 438 F.3d at 83. The jury's role is to \"determine any preliminary factual questions\" so that the court can determine the \"legal issue of the official's reasonableness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83-84.</p>\n<p>[11]  There may be additional relevant cases, but the plaintiffs have not cited them nor have we been provided with translations.</p>\n<p>[12]  There was a factual dispute at trial over the implications of the Ranger bylaws. \"When, as here, the defendants appeal from a denial of qualified immunity after a jury verdict has been rendered, the evidence is construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial, and deference is accorded the jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.\" <i>Guillemard-Ginorio,</i> 585 F.3d at 525 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We therefore read the cadet bylaws to support the proposition that the cadets would become Rangers so long as their training was successfully completed.</p>\n<p>[13]  The defendants also argue that they were entitled to qualified immunity from suit on the political discrimination claim. They provide no support for that argument, beyond the claim that the evidence was \"insufficient to establish Plaintiffs' <i>prima facie</i> case.\" Having determined that the jury reasonably found that Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo were motivated by political animus when they fired the cadets, we need not tarry long over this claim. \"[I]t is clearly established, and was at the time of the events in question, that terminating a non-policy-making employee based on political affiliation violates the First Amendment.\" <i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 21.</p>\n<p>[14]  The district court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <i>De Jesús Nazario,</i> in which we held definitively that our earlier holding in <i>Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines,</i> 69 F.3d 1205 (1st Cir.1995), on which the district court relied, did not apply to section 1983 actions. <i>De Jesús Nazario,</i> 554 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p>[15]  Nominal damages are available in a § 1983 action for the violation of a procedural due process right even without a corollary finding of injury or an award of compensatory damages. <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). Several circuits have held that, \"although the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Carey</i> involved nominal damages after a procedural due process violation, nominal damages are similarly appropriate in the context of a First Amendment violation.\" <i>KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville,</i> 465 F.3d 1256, 1261 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>see also </i><i>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe,</i> 619 F.2d 391, 402 (5th Cir.1980) (nominal damages for violation of First Amendment rights); <i>Draper v. Coombs,</i> 792 F.2d 915, 921-22 (9th Cir. 1986) (nominal damages for violation of either procedural or substantive constitutional right); <i>Risdal v. Halford,</i> 209 F.3d 1071, 1072 (8th Cir.2000) (nominal damages for First Amendment rights). Given the absence of a challenge to the nominal damages award, we see no need to address the merits of that question here. Procedurally, if a jury in a case brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 finds a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights, but fails to award compensatory damages, a plaintiff \"may ask the trial court for nominal damages on the occasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\" <i>Campos-Orrego v. Rivera,</i> 175 F.3d 89, 98-99 (1st Cir.1999). Such a procedure was followed in this case.</p>\n<p>[16]  Since the injury in this case for a due process violation and a First Amendment violation would seem to be the samethe loss of a jobit does seem odd that the jury awarded compensatory damages on the due process claim but not on the First Amendment claim. The district court speculated that the jury might have chosen that outcome because of the court's admonition in its instructions that the jury could not award double damages for the same injury. With a properly structured verdict form, the jury might have been able to indicate an award of compensatory damages for the First Amendment claim and the due process claim without violating the rule on double damages. However, such a verdict form was not submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p>[17]  The requirement for an award of punitive damages in an action pursuant to § 1983 is rigorous. <i>See </i><i>Méndez-Matos v.

The cadets alleged that they were summarily terminated due to their political affiliation with the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), in violation of their First Amendment rights, and without notice or a hearing, in violation of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. They sued three defendants, Salvador Salas-Quintana, the Secretary of the DNER at the time of their termination, Lourdes Cabezudo, the Director of Human Resources for the DNER, and Francis Nieves, Special Assistant to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>Twenty-eight of the plaintiffs convinced a jury that their due process rights had been violated by defendants Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo. The jury also determined that seven of those twenty-eight plaintiffs had experienced political discrimination. The jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $19,000 to each of the twenty-eight plaintiffs for the violation of their due process rights. In addition, the jury awarded $19,000 in punitive damages to each of the seven plaintiffs for the violation of their First Amendment rights. The defendants then moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial; the plaintiffs moved for reinstatement to their positions. The district court denied both motions. Defendants Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo (\"the defendants\") now appeal the district court's denials of their post-trial motions.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Because we find that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim, we vacate the jury's finding of a due process violation and the related award of compensatory damages. We affirm the jury's finding of a First Amendment violation and the award of nominal and punitive damages for that violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recite some of the relevant facts here in the light most favorable to the verdict for the purpose of background. <i>Omnipoint Holdings, Inc. v. City of Cranston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204051\"><a href=\"/opinion/204051/omnipoint-holdings-inc-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2009). We provide more details when analyzing the claims of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>This case, not surprisingly, arises from events following the general elections held in Puerto Rico on November 8, 2000 which resulted in the election of a new governor. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2006). Unlike the previous governor, who had been a member of the NPP, the new governor was a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). In January of 2001, a new secretary, Carlos Padín, was appointed by the new PDP administration to head the DNER.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the election, in August of 2000, the DNER published a job announcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> seeking cadets for its Ranger Corps. The Ranger Corps is a law enforcement body whose mission is to protect the environment in Puerto Rico. Rangers are trained in environmental protection. They carry guns and must receive specialized firearms training. Whereas Rangers are so-called \"regular employees\" under the Puerto Rico government's classification system, cadets are \"transitory employees.\" A cadet becomes a Ranger by meeting certain physical requirements, passing psychological exams, and successfully completing a training program which is provided by the DNER after the cadets are hired.</p>\n<p>The twenty-eight remaining plaintiffs in this case (\"the plaintiffs\") were all hired in late August and early September 2000 after responding to the August 2000 announcement seeking cadets. They were all members of the NPP, hired by the Secretary of the DNER under the NPP administration. As part of the hiring process, the plaintiffs were sent by the DNER to receive psychological testing at INSPIRA, a mental health testing facility. All of the plaintiffs received favorable evaluations. When the new PDP administration was elected in November 2000, the cadets had not yet been trained as Rangers. In December 2000, they were sent to a specially-convened training academy, but the academy was suspended after only a week. Although the cadets were told that their training would resume after the holidays, the training academy was never reconvened.</p>\n<p>Instead, under Secretary Padín, the DNER waffled about the fate of the cadets and whether to resume the training academy, which had been scheduled to reconvene on January 9, 2001. In early 2001, the Secretary asked Ferdinand Lugo-González, the legal advisor to the transition team, to conduct a review of all of the cadets' files, with a specific focus on whether the cadet had or had not been administered the requisite psychiatric and psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p>Lugo-González testified that the review was conducted because Secretary Padín was being pressured by the PDP leadership to fire the cadets who had been appointed under the NPP administration. According to Lugo-González, the resulting report, which was written by another member of the transition team, concluded that the cadets were qualified and recommended that the academy be renewed. In response, according to Lugo-González, Secretary Padín determined that he could not legally lay off the cadets. Rather than reconvening the academy, however, the DNER did nothing. Although their initial six-month contracts had not been renewed and their training had never been resumed, the plaintiffs continued to be employed as cadets and to assist the Rangers throughout Puerto Rico. As Lugo-González explained the plaintiffs' continued presence at the DNER, \"the Department had to use these Rangers, they needed them.\"</p>\n<p>In late October 2001, Secretary Salas-Quintana replaced Secretary Padín at the DNER after Padín resigned. During a chance encounter in the DNER building, Salas-Quintana asked Lugo-González why Secretary Padín had not yet dismissed the cadets. He added that he viewed it as his responsibility as Secretary of the DNER to dismiss those \"Republicanos.\"<sup>[2]</sup> To that end, Salas-Quintana created a committee to once again review the plaintiffs' appointments. Cabezudo was a member of that committee. She testified that she reviewed the personnel file of every cadet. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> As a result, each plaintiff received a letter in January 2002 stating that as of January 15, 2002, his or her appointment would not be renewed for failure to \"comply with the requirement of a[ ] psychological evaluation.\" The plaintiffs heard Salas-Quintana say on a radio program that the cadets who had been dismissed would be reinstated if they could produce evidence that they had received psychological evaluations. Despite submitting copies of their psychological evaluations at INSPIRA to the Human Resources Office of the DNER, they were not returned to their positions.</p>\n<p>Thirty-six cadets, the original plaintiffs, filed this suit in federal district court on January 25, 2002 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Salas-Quintana, Cabezudo and Nieves in their individual and official capacities. They alleged that the defendants violated their First Amendment rights by summarily terminating them due to their political affiliation, and violated their due process rights when they failed to give them notice or a hearing in connection with their termination.</p>\n<p>After a trial, the jury found that Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo had violated the rights of twenty-eight of the original thirty-six plaintiffs.<sup>[3]</sup> According to the jury, seven plaintiffs had experienced both political discrimination and a violation of their due process rights. The jury found that only the due process rights of an additional twenty-one plaintiffs had been violated. The jury awarded $19,000 in punitive damages on the First Amendment claim and $19,000 in compensatory damages on the due process claim to each of the seven plaintiffs who prevailed on both. It also awarded $19,000 in compensatory damages to each of the twenty-one plaintiffs who prevailed on their due process claims.</p>\n<p>The district court denied both the defendants' motion to set aside the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) or for a new trial under Fed R. Civ. P. 59, and the plaintiffs' request that the court order their reinstatement. Responding to a request made by the plaintiffs immediately after the verdict, the district court awarded $1.00 in nominal damages as to each of the seven plaintiffs who prevailed on their political discrimination claims because it found that such an award was necessary to support the punitive damages award on those claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a jury verdict may only be set aside if the court determines that \"`the evidence could lead a reasonable person to <i>only one conclusion.</i>'\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz v.

It is the defendant's burden to \"persuade[ ] the factfinder that its reason is credible.\" <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 77-78.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the district court's denial of defendants' Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, therefore, we would find grounds for reversal only if: (1) the plaintiffs did not introduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the political animus was a substantial or motivating factor behind the firing, or (2) the record evidence compels the conclusion that the plaintiffs would have been dismissed even without any discriminatory animus that may have existed. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Diaz,</i> 1 F.3d at 67.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> 1. The plaintiffs' evidence of political discrimination</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs presented ample evidence permitting a reasonable jury to conclude that their dismissals were the result of discrimination. The jury heard testimony at trial from the plaintiffs describing the anti-NPP environment at the DNER after the elections. As one cadet put it, after the new administration was elected in November 2000, officers in the Ranger corps discussed how \"they were going to throw us out because we came in under the administration of the New Progressive Party.\" Another cadet explained that a senior officer told him in the presence of other agents \"that having them won, that we were going to leave. We had a short time there.\"</p>\n<p>The jury also heard testimony that this hostility towards the NPP cadets permeated the PDP government to the extent that the leadership of the DNER was being pressured to fire the cadets well before Salas-Quintana took charge and made the decision to dismiss them. Lugo-González, a legal advisor to Secretary Padín during the transition from the NPP administration to the PDP in early 2001, testified that one of the issues of major concern to the transition committee was the training academy for the Ranger cadets. Secretary Padín had told him \"that the Academy was not being continued because those people had been selected under the administration of the New Progressive Party, and that is the only reason. Because judicially and administrat[ively], the [c]adets were qualified.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Lugo-González testified that it was clear from a meeting at the Governor's office he attended that the leadership of the PDP wanted the cadets to be laid off. When he communicated this desire to Padín, Padín refused to lay off the cadets because \"the only reason that they don't want to renew the Academy is because they had been appointed under the New Progressive Party Administration.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs introduced further testimony that both Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo were fully cognizant of the cadets' political affiliations. Lugo-González recounted a conversation he had with Salas-Quintana in late October 2001 in which Salas-Quintana referred specifically to the cadets' political affiliations, announcing, \"I am going to lay all those republicanos off.\" Lugo-González testified that Salas-Quintana told him, \"now that I'm going to be the Secretary, it is my responsibility, my obligation, my determination, I am the one that is going to go ahead and lay [the cadets] off.\" One plaintiff testified that Cabezudo, the Director of Human Resources, refused to give him a copy of his personnel file after his termination, telling him that the department \"is now under a new administration, under a new power,\" and that he should have made the request of \"the other secretary who did belong to [his] party.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Cabezudo also admitted that she conducted a review of the cadets' files which, unlike the review conducted under Secretary Padín, concluded that they were not qualified because they had gone to the wrong testing center for psychological <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> testing. She also oversaw the preparation of the letters informing the plaintiffs that they had been fired.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In short, based on the totality of the evidence describing the events leading up to the plaintiffs' firing, including the actions and statements of Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo themselves, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendants shared the prevailing sentiment among PDP officials that the cadets should be fired because of their alliance with the NPP, and acted accordingly.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense</h2>\n<p>Defendants assert on appeal that they successfully developed their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense at trial by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiffs' political affiliation with the NPP. They contend that the plaintiffs were dismissed from their positions because they either did not complete psychological evaluations or their evaluations were administered by INSPIRA, whose contract with the DNER provided for other psychiatric and psychological services, but not for testing.</p>\n<p>The defendants did present evidence at trial that the contract with INSPIRA did not cover psychiatric and/or psychological testing, whereas a contract with another provider, Carribean Medical Testing, did provide for such testing. Cabezudo also testified that she wrote a report at Salas-Quintana's behest in which she identified those cadets who had psychological evaluations from INSPIRA as unqualified for their positions.</p>\n<p>To rebut that defense, the plaintiffs presented evidence from José R. Rodríguez-Rosado, who was hired to coordinate the drug and psychiatric testing for the cadets in 2000. Rosado testified that INSPIRA was chosen by Secretary Pagán, the PDP Secretary who preceded Salas-Quintana, and the Comptroller to conduct the tests because it submitted the lowest price estimate. Rosado explained that the DNER requested that INSPIRA evaluate the candidates for Ranger cadets and that, accordingly, INSPIRA performed the evaluations. The plaintiffs corroborated this account, testifying that they were sent to INSPIRA by the DNER for the necessary psychological evaluations. The plaintiffs' INSPIRA evaluations themselves were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>Hearing this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that the INSPIRA evaluations were precisely the tests that were required by the DNER in accordance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> with the Ranger bylaws and that the defendants' claim otherwise was a pretext for the unlawful firing of the plaintiffs. It was the jury's prerogative, after hearing the conflicting accounts of the INSPIRA evaluations, to find that political affiliation, not the use of the wrong psychological testing center, was the \"but-for\" cause of the plaintiffs' dismissal. The evidence did not compel the jury to find that the defendants were entitled to prevail on their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Due Process and Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>The defendants argue that no reasonable jury could have found that the plaintiffs' due process rights had been violated because they did not have an entitlement to retain their positions as cadets. Without such an entitlement, the plaintiffs would not have a valid claim under the due process clause, which only protects government employees who have a property interest in continued employment. <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204134\"><a href=\"/opinion/204134/costa-urena-v-segarra/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2009). We need not reach the merits of this property interest argument because the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from suit on the due process claim.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Qualified immunity protects government officials \"from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span> (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The qualified immunity analysis has two parts. A court must decide whether the facts shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violation by the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 815-16; <i>Maldonado v. Fontanes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203857\"><a href=\"/opinion/203857/maldonado-v-fontanes/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 269 (1st Cir.2009).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Supreme Court doctrine had required that we begin our qualified immunity analysis by determining whether the plaintiff has shown a constitutional violation. <i>See </i><i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span> (2001) (holding that a court considering qualified immunity must decide, as a \"threshold question,\" whether the facts alleged show the violation of a constitutional right). Recently, however, the Court relaxed that requirement, allowing us to bypass the initial step in certain circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 818-19; <i>Maldonado,</i> 568 F.3d at 270. The Court agreed that the underlying principle of \"encouraging federal courts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future `is not meaningfully advanced ... when the definition of constitutional rights depends on a federal court's uncertain assumptions about state law.'\" <i>Pearson,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 819 (quoting <i>Egolf v.

This is a case in which any conclusions we might draw about the relevant Commonwealth law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> would be uncertain at best. Moreover, as we explain below, that very uncertainty is critical to our analysis of the clearly established prong of the qualified immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p>Property interests subject to due process protection are delineated \"by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 577, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In order to create a property interest, that independent source must \"give the individual a legitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.\" <i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454041/hatfield-bermudez-v-aldanondo-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2007). Whether the plaintiffs had a clearly-established property interest in their employment as cadets is therefore a question of Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p>The law is \"clearly established\" if courts have ruled that \"materially similar conduct was unconstitutional,\" or if there is a previously identified general constitutional principle that applies \"with obvious clarity to the specific conduct at issue.\" <i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2007). In other words, a right is clearly established if a reasonable official is on clear notice that what he or she is doing was unconstitutional. <i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 29. It was the plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate that the law was clearly established in early 2002, when the termination took place. <i>See </i><i>Davis v.

The plaintiffs cite two cases on point available to us in English translation. The plaintiffs do not cite or provide any additional cases on the question, nor has our independent research revealed any additional translated cases.</p>\n<p>In the earlier of the two available opinions, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court \"indicated that there may be certain circumstances in which a transitory employee <i>could</i> have a legitimate expectancy of contract renewal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60 (emphasis in original)(citing <i>Lupiánez de González v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">50866</span></span> (1977) (finding that a non-career employee who had been told that a permanent position was being created for her had a right to due process before being terminated)). In the latter of the cases, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that a \"transitory employee\" has \"a job retention expectancy <i>only</i> during the term of the appointment.\" <i>Departamento de Recursos Naturales v. Correa,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span>, 804, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448329</span></span> (1987). The Court stated that \"[a] person who has a transitory appointment, knowing that it expires at the end of the period for which it is given, cannot validly claim that he had a real expectancy that this type of appointment would offer him a permanent job status or the right to have the same constantly renewed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 806, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448329</span></span>.</p>\n<p>In the face of two cases that seem to give opposing answers to the question whether a transitory government employee has an entitlement to his or her continued employment, the plaintiffs do not explain how the law clearly established that conduct \"materially similar\" to that of the defendants in this case was unconstitutional at the time the plaintiffs were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> fired.<sup>[11]</sup> The plaintiffs were hired under bylaws that required that they receive training, and the successful completion of that training would result in their becoming non-transitory employees.<sup>[12]</sup> However, they were also indisputably transitory employees whose term had expired when they were discharged. Thus, their circumstances could be analogized either to <i>Lupiáñez</i> or <i>Correa.</i> We are unable to say that one case or the other clearly governs. Qualified immunity, therefore, shielded the defendants from the due process claims of the plaintiffs.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Although the defendants do not contest on appeal the jury's award of damages (thereby relying for success on their challenges to liability), we must say a few words about the damages awards to avoid any misunderstanding about the effect of our liability determinations on those awards. First, we note that the district court did not have to award $1.00 in nominal damages to validate the jury's award of punitive damages for the violation of the First Amendment rights of seven of the plaintiffs. We have recently determined that in a section 1983 action, a jury may properly award punitive damages even if it awards no nominal or compensatory damages. <i>De Jesús Nazario v. Morris Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203650\"><a href=\"/opinion/203650/de-jesus-nazario-v-morris-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.2009).<sup>[14]</sup> Nevertheless, as noted, the nominal damages award for the First Amendment violations are unchallenged and we see no reason to disturb them.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, because of our conclusion that the defendants were entitled to qualified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> immunity on the due process claims, we must vacate the jury's award of compensatory damages to the twenty-eight prevailing plaintiffs for the violation of their rights under the due process clause.<sup>[16]</sup> We affirm the award of punitive and nominal damages to the seven plaintiffs whose First Amendment rights were violated.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>For the aforementioned reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court on the political discrimination claims, and the award of nominal and punitive damages to the plaintiffs who prevailed on their political discrimination claims. We <i>vacate</i> the judgment on the due process claims of all plaintiffs and the award of compensatory damages based on the due process claims. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiffs have not appealed the denial of their request for reinstatement.</p>\n<p>[2]  According to the record, \"Republicanos\" is a term used to refer to members or sympathizers of the NPP, or those who are pro-statehood.</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court dismissed all claims against defendant Nieves. That determination has not been appealed. The eight original plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although this testimony might have been excluded on hearsay grounds, no such objection was made by the defendants.</p>\n<p>[5]  Lugo-González made this statement as part of his response to the question on direct examination, \"[w]as there any other source of pressure, concerning the appointment of the cadets?\" The defendants' hearsay objection to this testimony was overruled at trial and they have not pressed the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although Cabezudo denied ever meeting any of the plaintiffs, the jury was free to make the credibility determination favoring the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>[7]  The defendants contend that the plaintiffs' showing of a political motive for the plaintiffs' firings is undercut by evidence that some of the cadets who were dismissed were members of the PDP, while others who were not dismissed were members of the NPP. The defendants direct us to no evidence in support of the former claim. The defendants direct us to only one page of testimony in support of the latter contention. That testimony seems to suggest that two cadets who were not fired along with the majority of the class may have been NPP members. Another portion of the testimony, however, indicates that both of those cadets \"were also dismissed\" at a later date. Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, the additional information that two NPP cadets were fired later than the plaintiffs does not suggest that the jury was unreasonable in its conclusion that seven of the plaintiffs were fired because of their political affiliation.</p>\n<p>[8]  The defendants introduce no additional arguments in support of their claim that they were entitled to a new trial beyond their assertion that the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence. As described above, the evidence supporting the political discrimination claim was more than sufficient to support the verdict. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>[9]  Although the district court did not address this qualified immunity claim in its opinion denying the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, the defendants raised their claim of qualified immunity in both their 50(a) and 50(b) motions as well as on appeal. Thus, it is properly before us. We review the implicit denial of qualified immunity <i>de novo. </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín,</i> 438 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p>[10]  The district court erroneously submitted the question of qualified immunity to the jury. Whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity \"is a legal question for the court to decide.\" <i>Rodríguez-Marín,</i> 438 F.3d at 83. The jury's role is to \"determine any preliminary factual questions\" so that the court can determine the \"legal issue of the official's reasonableness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83-84.</p>\n<p>[11]  There may be additional relevant cases, but the plaintiffs have not cited them nor have we been provided with translations.</p>\n<p>[12]  There was a factual dispute at trial over the implications of the Ranger bylaws. \"When, as here, the defendants appeal from a denial of qualified immunity after a jury verdict has been rendered, the evidence is construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial, and deference is accorded the jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.\" <i>Guillemard-Ginorio,</i> 585 F.3d at 525 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We therefore read the cadet bylaws to support the proposition that the cadets would become Rangers so long as their training was successfully completed.</p>\n<p>[13]  The defendants also argue that they were entitled to qualified immunity from suit on the political discrimination claim. They provide no support for that argument, beyond the claim that the evidence was \"insufficient to establish Plaintiffs' <i>prima facie</i> case.\" Having determined that the jury reasonably found that Salas-Quintana and Cabezudo were motivated by political animus when they fired the cadets, we need not tarry long over this claim. \"[I]t is clearly established, and was at the time of the events in question, that terminating a non-policy-making employee based on political affiliation violates the First Amendment.\" <i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 21.</p>\n<p>[14]  The district court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <i>De Jesús Nazario,</i> in which we held definitively that our earlier holding in <i>Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707599\"><a href=\"/opinion/707599/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-944-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43780-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), on which the district court relied, did not apply to section 1983 actions. <i>De Jesús Nazario,</i> 554 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p>[15]  Nominal damages are available in a § 1983 action for the violation of a procedural due process right even without a corollary finding of injury or an award of compensatory damages. <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (1978). Several circuits have held that, \"although the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Carey</i> involved nominal damages after a procedural due process violation, nominal damages are similarly appropriate in the context of a First Amendment violation.\" <i>KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></span>, 1261 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>see also </i><i>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377019\"><a href=\"/opinion/377019/familias-unidas-an-unincorporated-association-and-irma-torrez-v-dolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 402 (5th Cir.1980) (nominal damages for violation of First Amendment rights); <i>Draper v. Coombs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471381\"><a href=\"/opinion/471381/robert-draper-v-davis-s-coombs/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 921-22 (9th Cir. 1986) (nominal damages for violation of either procedural or substantive constitutional right); <i>Risdal v. Halford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768402\"><a href=\"/opinion/768402/eddie-risdal-v-sally-c-halford-paul-hedgepeth-and-ronald-welder/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span>, 1072 (8th Cir.2000) (nominal damages for First Amendment rights). Given the absence of a challenge to the nominal damages award, we see no need to address the merits of that question here. Procedurally, if a jury in a case brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 finds a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights, but fails to award compensatory damages, a plaintiff \"may ask the trial court for nominal damages on the occasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\" <i>Campos-Orrego v. Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198453\"><a href=\"/opinion/198453/campos-orrego-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 98-99 (1st Cir.1999). Such a procedure was followed in this case.</p>\n<p>[16]  Since the injury in this case for a due process violation and a First Amendment violation would seem to be the samethe loss of a jobit does seem odd that the jury awarded compensatory damages on the due process claim but not on the First Amendment claim. The district court speculated that the jury might have chosen that outcome because of the court's admonition in its instructions that the jury could not award double damages for the same injury. With a properly structured verdict form, the jury might have been able to indicate an award of compensatory damages for the First Amendment claim and the due process claim without violating the rule on double damages. However, such a verdict form was not submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p>[17]  The requirement for an award of punitive damages in an action pursuant to § 1983 is rigorous. <i>See </i><i>Méndez-Matos v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203690\"><a href=\"/opinion/203690/mendez-matos-v-municipality-of-guaynabo/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2009) (holding punitive damages cannot be assessed in an action under § 1983 unless the plaintiff proves that the \"defendant `discriminate[d] in the face of a perceived risk that its actions [would] violate federal law'\") (quoting <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
