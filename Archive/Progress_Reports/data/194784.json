The appellant,  Herbert  H. Naidich,  has\n                \n\nappealed  the denial  of his  \"motion to  reopen\" a  district\n\ncourt order dismissing  his lawsuit for failure  to prosecute\n\nand failure to attend a court session.  In the absence of any\n\ndesignation to the  contrary, we treat the  court's dismissal\n\nas  a dismissal with prejudice.  Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land\n                                                             \n\nServ., Inc., 920  F.2d 1072, 1075 (1st Cir.  1990).  Although\n           \n\nsuch a dismissal is a harsh sanction, we conclude that it was\n\nwithin the court's permissible discretion in this case.\n\n     The gist of the matter is briefly stated.  On October 7,\n\n1992, two  years after the  start of this  age discrimination\n\nsuit, defendants  filed  a  substantial  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment.  The district court  on October 13, 1992, issued an\n\norder setting a scheduling conference for October 23 pursuant\n\nto Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 16(b) and  D. Mass. Loc.  R. 16.1.   The\n\norder specified that  its provisions relating to  preparation\n\nfor the conference  were of the utmost importance.   By cross\n\nreference, it  noted that sanctions  including dismissal were\n\nauthorized  for  failure   to  comply.    An   opposition  to\n\ndefendants'  motion  was  due under  the  governing  rules by\n\nOctober 21.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  We reject Naidich's suggestion that the dismissal in this\ncase was  pursuant to D. Mass.  Loc. R. 41.1(b), as  the case\nwas not on  any \"dismissal calendar,\"  as referenced in  that\nrule.\n\n     Naidich  neither appeared  at the  scheduling conference\n\nnor filed a timely opposition to the summary judgment motion.\n\nWhen Naidich did not appear, the district court dismissed the\n\ncase.  Naidich then filed a motion to reopen, but he  did not\n\nadequately explain  his  failure  to  attend  the  scheduling\n\nconference whose importance  had been plainly stressed.   Nor\n\ndid  he  adequately  explain  his failure  to  file  a timely\n\nopposition to  the motion for  summary judgment.   It appears\n\nthat Naidich's failure  to appear  may have  been related  to\n\ndisagreements  with  defense  counsel about  the  preliminary\n\nsteps  but  there  is  no  doubt that  Naidich  knew  of  the\n\nscheduled conference and disregarded that obligation.\n\n     There  is ample  authority  for  dismissal  where  court\n\nordered  deadlines  or  other   obligations  are  ignored  by\n\nlitigants, Fed.  R. Civ. P.  41(b), Link v. Wabash  R.R., 370\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 626, 630-31  (1962), and case precedent  sustaining such\n\ndismissals as well.  Figueroa  Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645,\n                                              \n\n649 (1st Cir.  1990) (dismissal where plaintiffs  were guilty\n\nnot only of simple delay but of disobedience of a court order\n\nas well); Zavala  Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera,  553 F.2d 710,\n                                             \n\n713 (1st  Cir. 1977) (dismissal where  plaintiffs disregarded\n\ncourt-ordered deadlines and  counsel failed to appear  at the\n\npretrial conference).\n\n     Equally  important, Naidich did  not seek leave,  at the\n\ntime  he sought to  reopen, to file the  tardy opposition.  A\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt  asked   to  forgive   procedural  defaults,   and  the\n\nconsequent waste of its time and resources, ought at the very\n\nleast be assured  that there is  some purpose to  reinstating\n\nthe case.  Evennow we think no such purpose hasbeen made out.\n\n     Indeed, because the sanction is a severe one and Naidich\n\nis proceeding  pro se, we  might find  this a  close case  if\n\nanything  filed by Naidich in the district court demonstrated\n\na substantial  defense to the  summary judgment motion.   But\n\neven now on appeal -- and appeal is too late -- Naidich makes\n\nonly  conclusory and unsupported  assertions that, except for\n\nthe  defendants'  description  of  the  company,  every other\n\nstatement   is   \"untrue\"  and   defendants'   documents  are\n\n\"forgeries\"  and  \"deceptions.\"     Given  defendants'  quite\n\nthorough  and well-documented  affidavits  -- which  strongly\n\nindicate  that Naidich's discharge was due to performance and\n\nnot  age  --  Naidich's  epithets  are of  no  weight.

Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (in order to set\n           \n\naside a judgment,  a movant must at least  establish, by more\n\nthan  a purely  conclusory allegation,  that  it possesses  a\n\npotentially meritorious claim).\n\n     There  was no abuse  of discretion either  in dismissing\n\nthis lawsuit or  in denying the motion to  reopen.
