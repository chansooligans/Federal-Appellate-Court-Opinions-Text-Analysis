In  a prior appeal  in this  case, we\n                    \n\nvacated  the dismissal of appellant's complaint under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) because it had entered without providing the\n\nplaintiff with notice and an  opportunity to oppose or amend.\n\nStreet  v. Vose,  No. 90-1415,  slip  op. (1st  Cir. Mar.  6,\n               \n\n1991).  This  appeal challenges the entry of summary judgment\n\nin favor of the defendants.  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          The appellant, a Massachusetts inmate, sued various\n\ncorrection  officials and  officers under  42  U.S.C.    1983\n\nalleging that he was denied constitutionally adequate  access\n\nto the courts  while confined in the segregation  unit of the\n\nMassachusetts  Correctional  Institution  at  Cedar  Junction\n\n(MCI-CJ).1   After remand,  the defendants moved  to dismiss,\n\nor,  in the alternative,  for summary judgment.   Appellant's\n\nopposition,  like  the defendants'  motion, was  supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence, and the district court properly treated\n\nthe motion as one for summary judgment.\n\n          Plaintiff's  chief   contention  is  that   he  was\n\nrepeatedly denied  access to  the separate satellite  library\n\nprovided  for segregated inmates, and access to other library\n\n                    \n\n1.  The appellant was  housed in this unit  for approximately\nsix  months   on  \"awaiting   action\"  status   before  being\nofficially   classified  to   the  unit  in   December  1989.\nPlaintiff's allegations cover the entire period, and although\nboth parties make much of the import of these distinctions in\nstatus, for purposes  of this discussion, we do  not find the\ndifferences of any material relevance.\n\n                             -2-\n\nmaterials from the prison's main library, in violation of the\n\nFirst and  Fourteenth Amendments  as well as  the terms  of a\n\nStipulation  of  Dismissal  (Stipulation)  in  another  case,\n\nCepulonis v.  Fair, No. 78-3233-Z  (D. Mass. Jun.  24, 1987).\n                  \n\nThe  Stipulation set  forth, inter alia,  detailed procedures\n                                       \n\nregarding segregated  inmates' use  of the satellite  library\n\nand  legal materials at  MCI-CJ.2   On appeal,  appellant has\n\nnot pursued any  argument with respect to his  third cause of\n\naction, which appears to assert state-created rights arguably\n\ninherent in the Stipulation, and, accordingly, that issue has\n\nbeen waived.\n\n                    \n\n2.  As to specific  claims that fall within the  scope of the\nStipulation, Street alleges that: between December 1988, when\nhe was formally classified to the segregation unit, and March\n1990, he filed 51 requests  to use the satellite law library,\nbut was given  timely access only 10 times  and otherwise had\nto wait up to two weeks before being given access; routinely,\nno  justification or reason was given as to why timely access\ncould not be provided; requests were not collected daily,  as\nrequired;  some   written  requests   were  refused  or   not\nprocessed;   volumes and  equipment in  the library  were not\nmaintained,  and   the  library   facility  and   hours  were\ninsufficient  partly  because  other  inmates  who  were  not\nclassified  to the segregation  unit, but were  housed there,\nwere  allowed  to   use  the  satellite  law   library,  thus\neffectively  denying access to  those for whom  the satellite\nlibrary was  intended.   Street  also  contends that  of  ten\nrequests for materials from the main library, three were  not\nprocessed, and, as to the  rest, only a small portion  of the\nrequested materials were received.  Of two requests for legal\nassistance, one was granted  late, and the other  was denied.\nFinally,  copying requests  were denied, and  necessary books\nwere   unavailable.    There  are  other  claims  beyond  the\nStipulation:  that his  legal  papers  were  \"ransacked\"  and\nstolen, and that favored inmates  are allowed frequent use of\nthe satellite library. \n\n                             -3-\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n          As  we  observed   in  our  prior  ruling,   it  is\n\nundisputed  that   inmates  seeking   release  or   otherwise\n\ncontesting the  constitutionality of the  conditions of their\n\nconfinement possess a right of access to the courts, that is,\n\nthe right to  \"adequate law libraries or  adequate assistance\n\nfrom persons  trained in the law.\"  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n817, 821, 827-28 (1977) (upholding state access-to-the-courts\n\nplan  under which,  inter  alia,  inmates  not  facing  court\n                               \n\ndeadlines might  have a  month's wait for  a library  visit).\n\nHowever, such  access is subject  to reasonable restrictions:\n\nmeaningful access  means no  more  than that  the state  must\n\nassure an indigent inmate \"an adequate opportunity to present\n\nhis claims fairly.\"  Id. at 823 (quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 600, 615-16 (1974)).  The relevant inquiry is whether an\n\ninmate has been  afforded \"a reasonably adequate  opportunity\n\nto  present claimed violations  of fundamental rights  to the\n\ncourts.\"  Id. at 825 (emphasis added).  \n             \n\n          Moreover, virtually all circuit courts have read an\n\ninjury  element into less than total access-denial claims and\n\nrequired prisoners to  shoulder an initial burden  of showing\n\nthat  the deprivation caused  some quantum of  prejudice with\n\nrespect to pending or contemplated litigation.  See Strickler\n                                                             \n\nv. Waters,     F.2d    ,     &amp;  n.10, 1993 WL 86457, *4, *11,\n         \n\nNo. 92-6147 (4th Cir. Mar.  26, 1993) (collecting cases).  We\n\n                             -4-\n\nheld  as much in  Sowell v. Vose,  941 F.2d 32,  35 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1991): Where a  prisoner has not been  denied complete access\n\nto legal  materials, but  alleges only  restrictions on  such\n\naccess,  \"actual injury  [is]  a prerequisite  to  recovery.\"\n\nThus,  unless the deprivation clearly amounts to an absolute,\n\ninherently prejudicial restriction on access (clearly not the\n\ncase here), in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment,\n\n\"actual injury\", i.e., an adverse effect on litigation caused\n\nby the challenged conduct must be sufficiently alleged by the\n\nplaintiff.  See  id. at 34-35; see also Shango v. Jurich, 965\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 289,  292 (7th Cir.  1992); Crawford-El v.

To that end,  an affidavit opposing summary judgment\n\nmust demonstrate with specifics, and not speculation, how the\n\nchallenged conduct caused  legal harm.   Sowell, 941 F.2d  at\n                                               \n\n35-36.\n\n                             III\n                                \n\n          Sowell was decided  after our prior ruling  in this\n                \n\ncase and  before  defendants'  summary  judgment  motion  was\n\nfiled.     In  its   accompanying  memoranda,  however,   the\n\ndefendants  pointed  out,  citing  Sowell,  that  plaintiff's\n                                         \n\ncomplaint  had failed  to allege  that any  of the  purported\n\nrestrictions  had prejudiced  him in  his  ability to  pursue\n\nthis, or any other, lawsuit.  The motion was supported by the\n\naffidavit of  MCI-CJ Superintendent Duval  who attested that,\n\n                             -5-\n\nsince being  housed in  the segregation  unit, the  plaintiff\n\n\"has used, and continues to  use the satellite law library.\" \n\n          Plaintiff's  memorandum in  opposition stated  that\n\nhis failure to allege actual prejudice was due to his lack of\n\nlegal training and the defendants' restriction on access.  He\n\ncontended that prejudice was demonstrated by the dismissal of\n\nanother  named  action  in February  1990.3    Alternatively,\n\nplaintiff  argued  that  he  did  not  need  to  show  actual\n\nprejudice  because   the  Cepulonis   Stipulation  controlled\n                                   \n\naccess-denial claims  by segregation unit  inmates at  MCI-CJ\n\nand  expressly  reserved to  inmates  the right  to  bring an\n\naction for damages.   Supporting plaintiff's memorandum  were\n\nthe Stipulation and the affidavits of the plaintiff and seven\n\nother segregation  unit inmates each attesting,  in identical\n\nfashion, to numerous violations of the Stipulation.4\n\n          These  profferings   by  the   plaintiff  fail   to\n\ndemonstrate a genuine issue as to  actual injury.  Appellant,\n\nwho is  an experienced pro  se litigator, does not  claim any\n                              \n\n                    \n\n3.  However, when the  opposition was  filed, plaintiff  knew\nthat that dismissal had been  vacated and the case  remanded.\nStreet v. Maloney,  No. 90-1280, slip op. (1st  Cir. Dec. 29,\n                 \n1990). \n\n4.  Included  were: routine delays  of 4-8 days  in receiving\naccess  to the satellite library; missing  books and torn and\nmissing pages in  many volumes;  out-of-date supplements  and\npocket parts; delays of several weeks in receiving books from\nthe  main library; typewriter  and copier  frequently broken;\nlack of paper and other supplies.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndelay or interruption  in this or any other  pending case; he\n\ncites no court-imposed deadlines that  he has missed, or that\n\nhe has been unable  to pursue any legal claim as  a result of\n\nany of  the alleged  deprivations.  See  Shango, 965  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n293.   At  most, he  has  described some  delay in  receiving\n\naccess  to library materials.  Such temporary restrictions on\n\naccess, bereft  of indications of adverse  legal consequence,\n\ndo not implicate a Bounds right.  Chandler v. Baird, 926 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1057,   1063  (11th  Cir.  1991).    Further,  appellant  has\n\npresented  well-drafted pleadings to  this court, as  well as\n\nthe  district court, demonstrating  that he has  retained the\n\nability to \"participate  meaningfully in the  legal process.\"\n\nSowell, 941 F.2d at 35.  While it is true that  the plaintiff\n      \n\ndid point to one adverse  judgment, it was later vacated, see\n                                                             \n\nante  n.3, and we can find nothing in the record indicating a\n    \n\nprejudicial \"causal relationship\"  between that dismissal, or\n\nany  of the  alleged deprivations,  for that matter,  and the\n\nconduct of the  defendants.  Id.;  see also Crawford-El,  951\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 1321; Chandler, 926 F.2d at 1062.5 \n                      \n\n                              IV\n                                \n\n          The  Stipulation  itself,  however,  does  not,  as\n\nappellant  appears to contend, afford an independent basis of\n\n                    \n\n5.  Because  we decide that the plaintiff  has failed to meet\nthe initial burden to show prejudice, we need not address the\ndegree to which any restrictions on access to legal materials\nare related to  legitimate penological interests.   Turner v.\n                                                          \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987).\n      \n\n                             -7-\n\nrelief from asserted violations of the right of access to the\n\ncourts.  See  Green v. McKaskle, 788 F.2d  1116, 1122-23 (5th\n                               \n\nCir. 1986).  The Cepulonis litigation that ultimately spawned\n                          \n\nthe Stipulation at issue here was a class action initiated by\n\nsegregation  unit  inmates at  MCI-CJ  (then MCI-Walpole)  to\n\nvindicate Bounds rights.  See  Cepulonis v. Fair, 732 F.2d 1,\n                                                \n\n2 (1st Cir. 1984).  And while the Stipulation states that its\n\nprocedures provide \"adequate  access to the courts,\"  we have\n\nnot  had  occasion  to  decide  whether   the  terms  of  the\n\nStipulation  are  constitutionally  required,  and  offer  no\n\nopinion in that regard. Even  assuming that the provisions of\n\nthe Stipulation were  intended to meet  no more than  minimal\n\nconstitutional  requirements   regarding  segregated   inmate\n\naccess  to the  courts,  we  would still  find  the grant  of\n\nsummary  judgment  to  the defendants  proper:  The  evidence\n\noffered by  the plaintiff  concerning any  violations of  the\n\nStipulation  suffers from the same infirmity described in our\n\ndiscussion  above  -  -  -  the   failure  to  demonstrate  a\n\nsufficient quantum of prejudice to permit the case to proceed\n\nfurther.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  To the extent that the plaintiff simply seeks to  enforce\nthe  Stipulation, he  may not  do so  directly under    1983.\nDeGidio v.  Pung, 920 F.2d  525, 534 (8th Cir.  1990); Green,\n                                                            \n788 F.2d  at 1123; cf. Welch  v.

In  a prior appeal  in this  case, we\n                    \n\nvacated  the dismissal of appellant's complaint under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) because it had entered without providing the\n\nplaintiff with notice and an  opportunity to oppose or amend.\n\nStreet  v. Vose,  No. 90-1415,  slip  op. (1st  Cir. Mar.  6,\n               \n\n1991).  This  appeal challenges the entry of summary judgment\n\nin favor of the defendants.  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          The appellant, a Massachusetts inmate, sued various\n\ncorrection  officials and  officers under  42  U.S.C.    1983\n\nalleging that he was denied constitutionally adequate  access\n\nto the courts  while confined in the segregation  unit of the\n\nMassachusetts  Correctional  Institution  at  Cedar  Junction\n\n(MCI-CJ).1   After remand,  the defendants moved  to dismiss,\n\nor,  in the alternative,  for summary judgment.   Appellant's\n\nopposition,  like  the defendants'  motion, was  supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence, and the district court properly treated\n\nthe motion as one for summary judgment.\n\n          Plaintiff's  chief   contention  is  that   he  was\n\nrepeatedly denied  access to  the separate satellite  library\n\nprovided  for segregated inmates, and access to other library\n\n                    \n\n1.  The appellant was  housed in this unit  for approximately\nsix  months   on  \"awaiting   action\"  status   before  being\nofficially   classified  to   the  unit  in   December  1989.\nPlaintiff's allegations cover the entire period, and although\nboth parties make much of the import of these distinctions in\nstatus, for purposes  of this discussion, we do  not find the\ndifferences of any material relevance.\n\n                             -2-\n\nmaterials from the prison's main library, in violation of the\n\nFirst and  Fourteenth Amendments  as well as  the terms  of a\n\nStipulation  of  Dismissal  (Stipulation)  in  another  case,\n\nCepulonis v.  Fair, No. 78-3233-Z  (D. Mass. Jun.  24, 1987).\n                  \n\nThe  Stipulation set  forth, inter alia,  detailed procedures\n                                       \n\nregarding segregated  inmates' use  of the satellite  library\n\nand  legal materials at  MCI-CJ.2   On appeal,  appellant has\n\nnot pursued any  argument with respect to his  third cause of\n\naction, which appears to assert state-created rights arguably\n\ninherent in the Stipulation, and, accordingly, that issue has\n\nbeen waived.\n\n                    \n\n2.  As to specific  claims that fall within the  scope of the\nStipulation, Street alleges that: between December 1988, when\nhe was formally classified to the segregation unit, and March\n1990, he filed 51 requests  to use the satellite law library,\nbut was given  timely access only 10 times  and otherwise had\nto wait up to two weeks before being given access; routinely,\nno  justification or reason was given as to why timely access\ncould not be provided; requests were not collected daily,  as\nrequired;  some   written  requests   were  refused  or   not\nprocessed;   volumes and  equipment in  the library  were not\nmaintained,  and   the  library   facility  and   hours  were\ninsufficient  partly  because  other  inmates  who  were  not\nclassified  to the segregation  unit, but were  housed there,\nwere  allowed  to   use  the  satellite  law   library,  thus\neffectively  denying access to  those for whom  the satellite\nlibrary was  intended.   Street  also  contends that  of  ten\nrequests for materials from the main library, three were  not\nprocessed, and, as to the  rest, only a small portion  of the\nrequested materials were received.  Of two requests for legal\nassistance, one was granted  late, and the other  was denied.\nFinally,  copying requests  were denied, and  necessary books\nwere   unavailable.    There  are  other  claims  beyond  the\nStipulation:  that his  legal  papers  were  \"ransacked\"  and\nstolen, and that favored inmates  are allowed frequent use of\nthe satellite library. \n\n                             -3-\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n          As  we  observed   in  our  prior  ruling,   it  is\n\nundisputed  that   inmates  seeking   release  or   otherwise\n\ncontesting the  constitutionality of the  conditions of their\n\nconfinement possess a right of access to the courts, that is,\n\nthe right to  \"adequate law libraries or  adequate assistance\n\nfrom persons  trained in the law.\"  Bounds v.

Sowell, 941 F.2d  at\n                                               \n\n35-36.\n\n                             III\n                                \n\n          Sowell was decided  after our prior ruling  in this\n                \n\ncase and  before  defendants'  summary  judgment  motion  was\n\nfiled.     In  its   accompanying  memoranda,  however,   the\n\ndefendants  pointed  out,  citing  Sowell,  that  plaintiff's\n                                         \n\ncomplaint  had failed  to allege  that any  of the  purported\n\nrestrictions  had prejudiced  him in  his  ability to  pursue\n\nthis, or any other, lawsuit.  The motion was supported by the\n\naffidavit of  MCI-CJ Superintendent Duval  who attested that,\n\n                             -5-\n\nsince being  housed in  the segregation  unit, the  plaintiff\n\n\"has used, and continues to  use the satellite law library.\" \n\n          Plaintiff's  memorandum in  opposition stated  that\n\nhis failure to allege actual prejudice was due to his lack of\n\nlegal training and the defendants' restriction on access.  He\n\ncontended that prejudice was demonstrated by the dismissal of\n\nanother  named  action  in February  1990.3    Alternatively,\n\nplaintiff  argued  that  he  did  not  need  to  show  actual\n\nprejudice  because   the  Cepulonis   Stipulation  controlled\n                                   \n\naccess-denial claims  by segregation unit  inmates at  MCI-CJ\n\nand  expressly  reserved to  inmates  the right  to  bring an\n\naction for damages.   Supporting plaintiff's memorandum  were\n\nthe Stipulation and the affidavits of the plaintiff and seven\n\nother segregation  unit inmates each attesting,  in identical\n\nfashion, to numerous violations of the Stipulation.4\n\n          These  profferings   by  the   plaintiff  fail   to\n\ndemonstrate a genuine issue as to  actual injury.  Appellant,\n\nwho is  an experienced pro  se litigator, does not  claim any\n                              \n\n                    \n\n3.  However, when the  opposition was  filed, plaintiff  knew\nthat that dismissal had been  vacated and the case  remanded.\nStreet v. Maloney,  No. 90-1280, slip op. (1st  Cir. Dec. 29,\n                 \n1990). \n\n4.  Included  were: routine delays  of 4-8 days  in receiving\naccess  to the satellite library; missing  books and torn and\nmissing pages in  many volumes;  out-of-date supplements  and\npocket parts; delays of several weeks in receiving books from\nthe  main library; typewriter  and copier  frequently broken;\nlack of paper and other supplies.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndelay or interruption  in this or any other  pending case; he\n\ncites no court-imposed deadlines that  he has missed, or that\n\nhe has been unable  to pursue any legal claim as  a result of\n\nany of  the alleged  deprivations.  See  Shango, 965  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n293.   At  most, he  has  described some  delay in  receiving\n\naccess  to library materials.

Even  assuming that the provisions of\n\nthe Stipulation were  intended to meet  no more than  minimal\n\nconstitutional  requirements   regarding  segregated   inmate\n\naccess  to the  courts,  we  would still  find  the grant  of\n\nsummary  judgment  to  the defendants  proper:  The  evidence\n\noffered by  the plaintiff  concerning any  violations of  the\n\nStipulation  suffers from the same infirmity described in our\n\ndiscussion  above  -  -  -  the   failure  to  demonstrate  a\n\nsufficient quantum of prejudice to permit the case to proceed\n\nfurther.6\n\n                    \n\n6.
