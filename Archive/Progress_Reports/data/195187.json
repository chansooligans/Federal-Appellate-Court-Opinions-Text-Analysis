William Bart Lloyd  appeals from\n                         \n\nan order of the United States District Court for the District\n\nof  Rhode  Island  dismissing his  suit  against  the Federal\n\nDeposit  Insurance Corporation  (FDIC),  as receiver  for the\n\nfailed   Capitol   Bank  and   Trust   Company,  of   Boston,\n\nMassachusetts (the Bank), for want of jurisdiction.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     In  November  1990,  appellant  purchased  an  apartment\n\nbuilding in Providence,  Rhode Island from  the Bank.   Under\n\nthe  sales agreement, the Bank undertook to provide financing\n\nfor both the  acquisition and the renovation  of the complex.\n\nAt the closing,  appellant signed a promissory  note, secured\n\nby a mortgage on  the property.  In  December 1990, the  Bank\n\nfailed.  The FDIC was appointed receiver.   In June 1991, the\n\nFDIC,  as receiver,  disaffirmed  the  original agreement  to\n\nfinance renovations.\n\n     In due course, appellant filed a proof of claim with the\n\nFDIC.   The proof was not acted upon within the required 180-\n\nday  period, see 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(5)(A)(i).  Nevertheless,\n                \n\nthe  FDIC  notified  appellant  on March  4,  1992,  that  it\n\nintended to  foreclose.  On March 17,  appellant responded by\n\nfiling this action in a Rhode Island  state court.  He sought\n\nto enjoin the FDIC from proceeding with the foreclosure, and,\n\nmoreover, to reform  or cancel the sales agreement, note, and\n\nmortgage (based on an asserted mutual mistake).\n\n                             -2-\n\n     On  March 30,  1992, the  FDIC removed  the case  to the\n\nUnited  States District Court  for the District  of Columbia.\n\nSee  12  U.S.C.    1819(b)(2)(B)  (giving  FDIC  authority to\n   \n\nremove  action \"to  the  appropriate United  States  district\n\ncourt\")  &amp; 12  U.S.C.    1821(d)(6)(A)  (giving \"district  or\n\nterritorial  court  of  the United  States  for  the district\n\nwithin which the depository  institution's principal place of\n\nbusiness is located or  the United States District Court  for\n\nthe  District  of  Columbia\"  jurisdiction   over  any  claim\n\ndisallowed by  the FDIC).   On  April 2,  the  FDIC moved  to\n\ntransfer the case to the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict  of Rhode Island  \"[f]or the convenience  of parties\n\nand witnesses.\"   28  U.S.C.   1404(a).   The  district court\n\ntransferred   the  case  on  April  23,  1992.    Appellant's\n\nadministrative claim was finally denied on June 9, 1992.\n\n     Once the  case  had returned  north, the  FDIC moved  to\n\ndismiss  for  lack  of subject  matter  jurisdiction  and for\n\nfailure to state a claim  upon which relief could be granted.\n\nAt the same time, the FDIC also argued that appellant's claim\n\nfor injunctive  relief was  barred by  12 U.S.C.    1821(j).1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Subsection 1821(j) provides, in part:\n\n          Except  as provided  in this  section, no\n          court may take any  action, except at the\n          request of  the  Board  of  Directors  by\n          regulation  or  order,   to  restrain  or\n                                                   \n          affect   the   exercise  of   powers   or\n                                                   \n          functions   of  the   Corporation  as   a\n                                                   \n          conservator or a receiver.\n                                   \n\n                             -3-\n\nThe  district   court  dismissed   the  case   for  want   of\n\njurisdiction.  This appeal followed.2 \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n     A  \"district court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the FDIC\n\nwhen the FDIC  is acting pursuant to its  statutory powers as\n\nreceiver.\"   Telematics Int'l,  Inc. v. NEMLC  Leasing Corp.,\n                                                           \n\n967  F.2d 703,  707 (1st  Cir. 1992);  see  also 12  U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n1821(j).  The FDIC has the  power as receiver to foreclose on\n\nthe property  of a  debtor.  See  12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(B)(ii)\n                                \n\n(giving  FDIC power to \"collect all obligations and money due\n\nthe [failed]  institution\").   Thus, the  district court  was\n\nwithout jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief appellant\n\nseeks.   See 281-300 Joint Venture v.  Onion, 938 F.2d 35, 39\n                                            \n\n(5th Cir. 1991) (injunction against receiver's foreclosure of\n\nappellants'  property barred by   1821(j)), cert. denied, 112\n                                                        \n\nS.Ct. 933 (1992).\n\n                    \n\n12 U.S.C.    1821(j) (emphasis  supplied).  According  to the\nFDIC, none  of the statutory exceptions  authorize injunctive\nrelief of the kind sought by appellant.\n\n2.  The  district judge determined  that the suit  was barred\nboth because  the court  lacked jurisdiction  pursuant to  12\nU.S.C.    1821(d)(6)(A) and  because it  had no  jurisdiction\nover  a case removed from a state  court which itself did not\nhave jurisdiction over the original  case.  While it was once\nsettled law that  a federal court's removal  jurisdiction was\nderived  from the state  court's jurisdiction, this  rule has\nbeen abolished by statute.   See 28 U.S.C.    1441(e).  Thus,\n                                \nwe address  only the effect  of 12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(6)(A) on\nthe district court's jurisdiction.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Appellant's  claims  for  equitable  reformation  and/or\n\ncancellation of  the contract fare  no better.   These claims\n\nlie  in  the  maw  of  the statute,  for,  in  the  statutory\n\nparlance, the plaintiff's complaint \"seeks a determination of\n\nrights with  respect  to  []  the assets  of  a[]  depository\n\ninstitution  for  which  the Corporation  has  been appointed\n\nreceiver.\"   12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(13)(D).  By its  terms, the\n\nstatute limits federal court jurisdiction over such claims to\n\nthose  instances  \"otherwise  provided\"  in section  1821(d).\n\nId.; see also Marquis v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 965 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1148, 1153 (1st Cir. 1992).  We  understand this to mean that\n\nthe federal  courts are  barred  from asserting  jurisdiction\n\nover  claims   against  the   assets  of  failed   depository\n\ninstitutions except as expressly  or impliedly permitted, see\n                                                             \n\nMarquis, 965 F.2d  at 1153 (suggesting  that, in addition  to\n       \n\nits  express  grants of  jurisdiction,  section  1821(d) also\n\nimplies   the    existence   of    jurisdiction   in    other\n\ncircumstances),  by  virtue  of  the  various  subsections of\n\nsection 1821(d).  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. J.F. Assocs.,\n                                                           \n\n813 F.Supp. 951, 954 (N.D.N.Y.  1993); see also Landmark Land\n                                                             \n\nCo.  v.

We further\n\nunderstand the specific  jurisdictional provision of  section\n\n1821(d)(13)(D)   to    control   over   the    more   general\n\n                             -5-\n\njurisdictional  grant found  in 12  U.S.C.    1819(b)(2)(A).3\n\nSee Gozlon-Peretz v. United States,  498 U.S. 395, 407 (1991)\n                                  \n\n(\"[a]  specific provision controls  over one of  more general\n\napplication\") (citing  Crawford Fitting Co.  v. J.T. Gibbons,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 482 U.S. 437, 445 (1987)).  \n   \n\n     Appellant  seeks to  find  safe  haven  in  the  statute\n\nitself:  after all,  section 1821(d)(6)(A)  expressly confers\n\njurisdiction  upon federal  courts to  entertain suits  based\n\nupon disallowed claims.  The district court did not buy these\n\nwares.  Rather,  Judge Lagueux, adopting a position  urged by\n\nthe  FDIC  below,  ruled  that  the  only  courts  which  had\n\njurisdiction  over  appellant's   claims  were  the   federal\n\ndistrict  court  for  the  district  where  the  failed  bank\n\nmaintained   its   principal   place   of   business   (here,\n\nMassachusetts)  and  the  federal   district  court  for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Columbia,  see  12   U.S.C.     1821(d)(6)(A).4\n                            \n\n                    \n\n3.  Subsection 1819(b)(2)(A) provides, in part, that:\n\n     all  suits .  . . to  which the  [FDIC] is  a party\n     shall  be deemed  to  arise under  the laws  of the\n     United States.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1819(b)(2)(A).\n\n4.  The statute provides,  in relevant part, that  a claimant\nmay:\n\n     file  suit on  such claim  (or  continue an  action\n     commenced before  the appointment of  the receiver)\n     in the district  court or territorial court  of the\n     United  States for  the district  within  which the\n     depository   institution's   principal   place   of\n     business is  located or the United  States District\n\n                             -6-\n\nLloyd's  appeal attacks  this  ruling.    And  appellant  has\n\nacquired a rather surprising ally:   reversing its field, the\n\nFDIC  now  contends  that  section  1821(d)(6)(A)  is  not  a\n\njurisdictional limitation,  but is instead  a venue provision\n\nthat can  be waived (and  which the  FDIC has waived  in this\n\ninstance).   We  think  the  FDIC was  right  the first  time\n\naround.\n\n     For   one  thing,   the   plain   language  of   section\n\n1821(d)(6)(A)  indicates  that it  is a  jurisdictional grant\n\nlimited  to the federal district court for the district where\n\nthe institution has  its principal place of  business and the\n\nUnited  States District Court  for the District  of Columbia.\n\nSee  id.  (providing  that  either  such  court  \"shall  have\n       \n\njurisdiction to hear such claim\").  Accord J.F.  Assocs., 813\n                                                       \n\nF.Supp. at  958.  For  another thing, while the  reasoning of\n\nthe only  court  that, to  our knowledge,  has found  section\n\n1821(d)(6)(A) to be a venue provision supports the FDIC's new\n\nposition, the reasoning is not persuasive--and the holding is\n\nnot  inconsistent, simpliciter, with reading the section as a\n                              \n\njurisdictional  provision.    In Vinton  v.  Trustbank, Sav.,\n                                                             \n\nF.S.B., 798  F.Supp. 1055 (D.Del. 1992), the  court held that\n     \n\nsection  1821(d)(6)(A)   was  not   a  grant   of  \"exclusive\n\n                    \n\n     Court  for the District of Columbia (and such court\n     shall have jurisdiction to hear such claim).\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(6)(A).\n\n                             -7-\n\njurisdiction\" to the two listed  courts and did not deprive a\n\nthird  court  of   jurisdiction  which   it  had   previously\n\nobtained.5   Id.  at 1065. But  section 1821(d)(6)(A)  can be\n               \n\nread  as a  grant of  jurisdiction to  two designated  courts\n\nwithout  being read as a completely  exclusive grant.  Accord\n                                                             \n\nJ.F.  Assocs., 813  F.Supp.  at  955.   As  we interpret  it,\n            \n\nsection 1821(d)(6)(A) does not extend jurisdiction beyond the\n\ntwo  specified courts--but,  by the  same token, it  does not\n\ndeprive a court  of jurisdiction  where, as  in Vinton,  that\n                                                      \n\njurisdiction   has   a    source   independent   of   section\n\n1821(d)(6)(A).  See Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1152-54 (determining\n                           \n\nthat  subsections  of  section  1821(d)  other  than  section\n\n1821(d)(6)(A) permit federal courts to retain jurisdiction in\n\ncircumstances  where   a   bank's   failure   postdates   the\n\ninstitution of the action).  \n\n     In the instant  case, section 1821(d)(6)(A) provides  no\n\nbasis  for jurisdiction in  the United States  District Court\n\nfor the District of Rhode  Island.  Nor has appellant  or the\n\nFDIC  indicated any source of federal jurisdiction in section\n\n1821(d) other than section 1821(d)(6)(A).  Consequently, even\n\nthough,  viewed simply  from the  perspective  of policy,  it\n\nmight seem sensible  to allow for  suits of  this sort to  be\n\n                    \n\n5.  In  Vinton,  the  United States  District  Court  for the\n              \nDistrict  of Delaware had obtained jurisdiction over the case\nbefore   the  Resolution  Trust   Corporation  took  over  as\nreceiver.\n\n                             -8-\n\ntried in  the district  where the  transactions occurred  and\n\nwhere  the court  is  likely  to be  most  familiar with  any\n\napplicable local law, the statutory language, especially that\n\nof    1821(d)(13)(D), compels  us, absent  a more  persuasive\n\nargument to  the contrary, to  find that  the district  court\n\nappropriately  determined  that  it   lacked  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction over Lloyd's suit.   See Massachusetts Financial\n                                                             \n\nServices, Inc. v. Securities  Investor Protection, Corp., 545\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 754, 756 (1st  Cir. 1976), (\"a statute's  plain language\n\nis  the primary indicator of its meaning\"), cert. denied, 431\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 904 (1977).6\n\n     The  normal remedy in  these circumstances would  be for\n\nthe  district court to dismiss this case  (as it did).  Here,\n\nhowever,  a dismissal  seems unfair  since  it would  deprive\n\nLloyd,  who  is in  effect  a  victim  of  the  FDIC-inspired\n\ntransfer to  the  District Court  for the  District of  Rhode\n\nIsland,  of  any   means  of  redress.

Under the sales agreement, the Bank undertook to provide financing for both the acquisition and the renovation of the complex.  At the closing, appellant signed a promissory note, secured by a mortgage on the property.  In December 1990, the Bank failed.  The FDIC was appointed receiver.  In June 1991, the FDIC, as receiver, disaffirmed the original agreement to finance renovations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, appellant filed a proof of claim with the FDIC.  The proof was not acted upon within the required 180-day period, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i).  Nevertheless, the FDIC notified appellant on March 4, 1992, that it intended to foreclose.  On March 17, appellant responded by filing this action in a Rhode Island state court.  He sought to enjoin the FDIC from proceeding with the foreclosure, and, moreover, to reform or cancel the sales agreement, note, and mortgage (based on an asserted mutual mistake).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 1992, the FDIC removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(B) (giving FDIC authority to remove action \"to the appropriate United States district court\") &amp; 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A) (giving \"district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the depository institution's principal place of business is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\" jurisdiction over any claim disallowed by the FDIC).  On April 2, the FDIC moved to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses.\"  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a).  The district court transferred the case on April 23, 1992.  Appellant's administrative claim was finally denied on June 9, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the case had returned north, the FDIC moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  At the same time, the FDIC also argued that appellant's claim for injunctive relief was barred by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"district court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the FDIC when the FDIC is acting pursuant to its statutory powers as receiver.\"  Telematics Int'l, Inc. v. NEMLC Leasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 707 (1st Cir.1992);  see also 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j).  The FDIC has the power as receiver to foreclose on the property of a debtor.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(2)(B)(ii) (giving FDIC power to \"collect all obligations and money due the [failed] institution\").  Thus, the district court was without jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief appellant seeks.  See 281-300 Joint Venture v. Onion, 938 F.2d 35, 39 (5th Cir.1991) (injunction against receiver's foreclosure of appellants' property barred by Sec. 1821(j)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 933, 117 L.Ed.2d 105 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's claims for equitable reformation and/or cancellation of the contract fare no better.  These claims lie in the maw of the statute, for, in the statutory parlance, the plaintiff's complaint \"seeks a determination of rights with respect to [ ] the assets of a[ ] depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed receiver.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D).  By its terms, the statute limits federal court jurisdiction over such claims to those instances \"otherwise provided\" in section 1821(d).  Id.;  see also Marquis v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 965 F.2d 1148, 1153 (1st Cir.1992).  We understand this to mean that the federal courts are barred from asserting jurisdiction over claims against the assets of failed depository institutions except as expressly or impliedly permitted, see Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1153 (suggesting that, in addition to its express grants of jurisdiction, section 1821(d) also implies the existence of jurisdiction in other circumstances), by virtue of the various subsections of section 1821(d).  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. J.F. Assocs., 813 F.Supp. 951, 954 (N.D.N.Y.1993);  see also Landmark Land Co. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 948 F.2d 910, 912-13 (5th Cir.1991) (interpreting similarly worded provision in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1818(i)(1) as limiting jurisdiction).  We further understand the specific jurisdictional provision of section 1821(d)(13)(D) to control over the more general jurisdictional grant found in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S.Ct. 840, 848, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991) (\"[a] specific provision controls over one of more general application\") (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 445, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 2499, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to find safe haven in the statute itself:  after all, section 1821(d)(6)(A) expressly confers jurisdiction upon federal courts to entertain suits based upon disallowed claims.  The district court did not buy these wares.  Rather, Judge Lagueux, adopting a position urged by the FDIC below, ruled that the only courts which had jurisdiction over appellant's claims were the federal district court for the district where the failed bank maintained its principal place of business (here, Massachusetts) and the federal district court for the District of Columbia, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lloyd's appeal attacks this ruling.  And appellant has acquired a rather surprising ally:  reversing its field, the FDIC now contends that section 1821(d)(6)(A) is not a jurisdictional limitation, but is instead a venue provision that can be waived (and which the FDIC has waived in this instance).  We think the FDIC was right the first time around.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, the plain language of section 1821(d)(6)(A) indicates that it is a jurisdictional grant limited to the federal district court for the district where the institution has its principal place of business and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  See id.  (providing that either such court \"shall have jurisdiction to hear such claim\").  Accord J.F. Assocs., 813 F.Supp. at 958.   For another thing, while the reasoning of the only court that, to our knowledge, has found section 1821(d)(6)(A) to be a venue provision supports the FDIC's new position, the reasoning is not persuasive--and the holding is not inconsistent, simpliciter, with reading the section as a jurisdictional provision.  In Vinton v. Trustbank Sav., F.S.B., 798 F.Supp. 1055 (D.Del.1992), the court held that section 1821(d)(6)(A) was not a grant of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to the two listed courts and did not deprive a third court of jurisdiction which it had previously obtained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Id. at 1065.   But section 1821(d)(6)(A) can be read as a grant of jurisdiction to two designated courts without being read as a completely exclusive grant.  Accord J.F. Assocs., 813 F.Supp. at 955.   As we interpret it, section 1821(d)(6)(A) does not extend jurisdiction beyond the two specified courts--but, by the same token, it does not deprive a court of jurisdiction where, as in Vinton, that jurisdiction has a source independent of section 1821(d)(6)(A).  See Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1152-54 (determining that subsections of section 1821(d) other than section 1821(d)(6)(A) permit federal courts to retain jurisdiction in circumstances where a bank's failure postdates the institution of the action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, section 1821(d)(6)(A) provides no basis for jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  Nor has appellant or the FDIC indicated any source of federal jurisdiction in section 1821(d) other than section 1821(d)(6)(A).  Consequently, even though, viewed simply from the perspective of policy, it might seem sensible to allow for suits of this sort to be tried in the district where the transactions occurred and where the court is likely to be most familiar with any applicable local law, the statutory language, especially that of Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D), compels us, absent a more persuasive argument to the contrary, to find that the district court appropriately determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Lloyd's suit.  See Massachusetts Financial Services, Inc. v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 545 F.2d 754, 756 (1st Cir.1976), (\"a statute's plain language is the primary indicator of its meaning\"), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 1696, 52 L.Ed.2d 388 (1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The normal remedy in these circumstances would be for the district court to dismiss this case (as it did).  Here, however, a dismissal seems unfair since it would deprive Lloyd, who is in effect a victim of the FDIC-inspired transfer to the District Court for the District of Rhode Island, of any means of redress.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(B) (unless claimant requests review of disallowance of claim within 60 days of determination, \"disallowance shall be final, and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim\").  Since the transferor court was not empowered to order the transfer of this action to a court which lacked subject matter jurisdiction over it, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (transfer may only be to a district where the action \"might have been brought\"), we think it more prudent that the district court retransfer this action to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the ground that the transfer was improvidently granted.  See Turner v. Kelley, 411 F.Supp. 1331 (D.Kan.1976) (retransferring case to transferor court because transferee court lacked jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(a));  Majewski v. New York C.R. Co., 227 F.Supp. 950 (W.D.Mich.1964) (retransferring case to transferor court because transferee court lacked jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal is therefore vacated for the purpose of allowing the district court to enter such an order.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Subsection 1821(j) provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Except as provided in this section, no court may take any action, except at the request of the Board of Directors by regulation or order, to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the Corporation as a conservator or a receiver.</p>\n        <p>12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j) (emphasis supplied).  According to the FDIC, none of the statutory exceptions authorize injunctive relief of the kind sought by appellant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district judge determined that the suit was barred both because the court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A) and because it had no jurisdiction over a case removed from a state court which itself did not have jurisdiction over the original case.  While it was once settled law that a federal court's removal jurisdiction was derived from the state court's jurisdiction, this rule has been abolished by statute.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(e).  Thus, we address only the effect of 12 U.S.C.

See, e.g., Howell v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 986 F.2d 569, 571 (1st Cir.1993).

These claims lie in the maw of the statute, for, in the statutory parlance, the plaintiff's complaint \"seeks a determination of rights with respect to [ ] the assets of a[ ] depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed receiver.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D).  By its terms, the statute limits federal court jurisdiction over such claims to those instances \"otherwise provided\" in section 1821(d).  Id.;  see also Marquis v.

We understand this to mean that the federal courts are barred from asserting jurisdiction over claims against the assets of failed depository institutions except as expressly or impliedly permitted, see Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1153 (suggesting that, in addition to its express grants of jurisdiction, section 1821(d) also implies the existence of jurisdiction in other circumstances), by virtue of the various subsections of section 1821(d).

The district court did not buy these wares.  Rather, Judge Lagueux, adopting a position urged by the FDIC below, ruled that the only courts which had jurisdiction over appellant's claims were the federal district court for the district where the failed bank maintained its principal place of business (here, Massachusetts) and the federal district court for the District of Columbia, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lloyd's appeal attacks this ruling.  And appellant has acquired a rather surprising ally:  reversing its field, the FDIC now contends that section 1821(d)(6)(A) is not a jurisdictional limitation, but is instead a venue provision that can be waived (and which the FDIC has waived in this instance).  We think the FDIC was right the first time around.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, the plain language of section 1821(d)(6)(A) indicates that it is a jurisdictional grant limited to the federal district court for the district where the institution has its principal place of business and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  See id.  (providing that either such court \"shall have jurisdiction to hear such claim\").  Accord J.F. Assocs., 813 F.Supp. at 958.   For another thing, while the reasoning of the only court that, to our knowledge, has found section 1821(d)(6)(A) to be a venue provision supports the FDIC's new position, the reasoning is not persuasive--and the holding is not inconsistent, simpliciter, with reading the section as a jurisdictional provision.  In Vinton v. Trustbank Sav., F.S.B., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></span> (D.Del.1992), the court held that section 1821(d)(6)(A) was not a grant of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to the two listed courts and did not deprive a third court of jurisdiction which it had previously obtained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Id. at 1065.   But section 1821(d)(6)(A) can be read as a grant of jurisdiction to two designated courts without being read as a completely exclusive grant.  Accord J.F. Assocs., 813 F.Supp. at 955.   As we interpret it, section 1821(d)(6)(A) does not extend jurisdiction beyond the two specified courts--but, by the same token, it does not deprive a court of jurisdiction where, as in Vinton, that jurisdiction has a source independent of section 1821(d)(6)(A).  See Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1152-54 (determining that subsections of section 1821(d) other than section 1821(d)(6)(A) permit federal courts to retain jurisdiction in circumstances where a bank's failure postdates the institution of the action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, section 1821(d)(6)(A) provides no basis for jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  Nor has appellant or the FDIC indicated any source of federal jurisdiction in section 1821(d) other than section 1821(d)(6)(A).  Consequently, even though, viewed simply from the perspective of policy, it might seem sensible to allow for suits of this sort to be tried in the district where the transactions occurred and where the court is likely to be most familiar with any applicable local law, the statutory language, especially that of Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D), compels us, absent a more persuasive argument to the contrary, to find that the district court appropriately determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Lloyd's suit.  See Massachusetts Financial Services, Inc. v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340731\"><a href=\"/opinion/340731/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95781-massachusetts-financial-services-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir.1976), (\"a statute's plain language is the primary indicator of its meaning\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1696</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></span> (1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The normal remedy in these circumstances would be for the district court to dismiss this case (as it did).  Here, however, a dismissal seems unfair since it would deprive Lloyd, who is in effect a victim of the FDIC-inspired transfer to the District Court for the District of Rhode Island, of any means of redress.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(B) (unless claimant requests review of disallowance of claim within 60 days of determination, \"disallowance shall be final, and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim\").  Since the transferor court was not empowered to order the transfer of this action to a court which lacked subject matter jurisdiction over it, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (transfer may only be to a district where the action \"might have been brought\"), we think it more prudent that the district court retransfer this action to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the ground that the transfer was improvidently granted.  See Turner v. Kelley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1643046\"><a href=\"/opinion/1643046/turner-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

While it was once settled law that a federal court's removal jurisdiction was derived from the state court's jurisdiction, this rule has been abolished by statute.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(e).
