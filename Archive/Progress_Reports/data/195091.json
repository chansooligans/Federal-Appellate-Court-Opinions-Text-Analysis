In Nos.  93-1330  and 93-1331,  appellant\n                \n\ncontends  that  the  district  judge lacked  jurisdiction  to\n\npreside over his collateral proceedings because  she presided\n\nat  trial.   This allegation,  which is  identical to  one we\n\nrecently  rejected in  another series  of  appeals from  this\n\nappellant, is frivolous.  Appellant's reliance on Halliday v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited  States, 380 F.2d  270 (1st Cir.  1967), is misplaced.\n              \n\nSee, e.g., Panzardi-Alvarez  v. United States, 879  F.2d 975,\n                                             \n\n985  (1st  Cir. 1989),  cert. denied,  493 U.S.  1082 (1990);\n                                    \n\nTracey v. United  States, 739 F.2d 679, 681  (1st Cir. 1984),\n                        \n\ncert. denied, 469 U.S. 1109 (1985).\n            \n\n     In No.  93-1264, appellant appeals from the  denial of a\n\nmotion under Fed.  R. Crim. P. 41(e) for  return of property.\n\nHe  there sought the return of  some 135 historical documents\n\nwhich, he alleged,  had been stricken from the indictment due\n\nto lack  of proof of  government ownership.  This  motion was\n\nfiled  nearly four  years after  his conviction and  over two\n\nyears after our  affirmance thereof.   See  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMount, 896 F.2d 612 (1st Cir.  1990).  Because of such delay,\n     \n\nthe district court denied the motion on the ground of laches.\n\nSee, e.g., Soviero v. United States, 967 F.2d 791, 792-93 (2d\n                                   \n\nCir.  1992)  (noting  that request  for  return  of property,\n\nwhether deemed  a  Rule  41(e)  motion or  a  separate  civil\n\nproceeding, is subject  to equitable concerns).   We find  no\n\nabuse  of discretion.   See, e.g.,  K-Mart Corp.  v. Oriental\n                                                             \n\nPlaza,  Inc.,  875 F.2d  907,  911  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (laches\n            \n\ndetermination reviewed \"only for abuse of discretion\"). \n\n     We  note initially  that the  factual  premise on  which\n\nappellant's request  rests--that 135 documents  were stricken\n\nfrom the  indictment--flies in the  face of the record.   See\n                                                             \n\n896 F.2d at 614, 616-20  (discussing proof of ownership as to\n\nall  167   documents  charged  in   superseding  indictment).\n\nAppellant  points  to  a  two-page  excerpt  from  the  trial\n\ntranscript indicating that certain exhibits (listed by number\n\nbut not otherwise identified) were  stricken.  To be sure, we\n\ncannot rule out the possibility, on the limited record before\n\nus, that such excluded exhibits may have included some  small\n\nnumber  of documents  as to  which  government ownership  was\n\nnever established.    Yet  it  is precisely  because  of  the\n\ndifficulties  of ascertaining such  facts at this  late stage\n\nthat the doctrine of laches was, we  think, properly applied.\n\nAppellant had  ample opportunity to  seek such relief  in the\n\nwake  of  his conviction,  when the  full record  was readily\n\navailable and the events at trial  were fresh in the minds of\n\nall  parties.1   His request  that  the trial  record now  be\n\nparsed, document by  document, in order to  reconstruct proof\n\nof ownership is one that  the district court was justified in\n\nsummarily rejecting as a matter of equitable discretion.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Given  the  quantity   of  post-conviction  motions   and\npetitions he has  filed, his claim that he  was disabled from\ndoing so because of his incarceration is frivolous.  \n\n                             -3-\n\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n                                \n\n                             -4-\n",
