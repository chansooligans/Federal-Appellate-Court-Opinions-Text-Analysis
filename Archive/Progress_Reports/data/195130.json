Having\n\nreviewed the record, we decline to disturb the judgment below.\n\n                                I\n\n          This   case  finds   its   genesis  in   an  undercover\n\ninvestigation   of  narcotics   trafficking   conducted  by   the\n\nProvidence, Rhode  Island police  department.  The  investigation\n\nfocused  on an  apartment building  at 70 Peace  Street.   In due\n\ncourse,  the police began  paying special attention  to apartment\n\n706.  On  several occasions in late  May and early June  of 1992,\n\nthey observed appellant in and around the apartment.\n\n          After  intensive  surveillance,  an  informant,  acting\n\nunder  police auspices, entered  apartment 706 during  early June\n\nand  made  a controlled  purchase of  cocaine from  the principal\n\nsuspect, Moreno, inside the apartment.  While the transaction was\n\nin  progress detectives observed  Paulino peering from  a window.\n\nThe  officers subsequently obtained a search warrant and executed\n\nit  on June 11,  1992.  They discovered  appellant in the kitchen\n\nand  a stranger,  Junior Rodriguez,  taking a  shower.1   The man\n\nknown as \"Moreno\" was elsewhere  when the police arrived, and his\n\nwhereabouts remain a mystery.\n\n          Although the tiny apartment  contained little more than\n\na  kitchen,  bathroom,  and bedroom,  it  nevertheless  disclosed\n\n                    \n\n     1Prior to June 11, 1992, the date when the police discovered\nhim completing  his ablutions,  Rodriguez had  never before  been\nseen in or around 70 Peace St.\n\n                                2\n\nbountiful evidence  of drug  trafficking activities.   Detectives\n\nfound an  assortment  of  drugs  in the  bedroom,  namely,  three\n\nplastic bags containing  64.02 grams of cocaine in the aggregate,\n\nand a fourth  bag containing a \"speedball\" (a  mixture of cocaine\n\nand heroin)  weighing 11.79  grams.  The  search party  found the\n\nspeedball perched on  a small coffee  table, inside a  five-pound\n\nbag of rice; on a piece of foil next to the rice rested a rock of\n\ncocaine weighing  95.11 grams.   The rock showed signs  of having\n\nrecently been \"cooked\".\n\n          The  search uncovered  more than  the narcotics  cache.\n\nFrom  atop the coffee table, the  police confiscated a collection\n\nof  drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale, three sifters,\n\na  playing card,  packaging materials,  three  separate kinds  of\n\ncutting agents,  and a small notebook that  appeared to be a drug\n\nledger.  On a chair next to the table, under a shirt, within easy\n\nreaching  distance  of  the  drugs,  officers  spotted  a  loaded\n\nrevolver.2   On appellant's person,  officers found a key  to the\n\napartment's  front door.    No  other key  to  the apartment  was\n\nlocated.\n\n                                II\n\n          Based  primarily on this evidence, a federal grand jury\n\nreturned a three-count  indictment against appellant.   Count one\n\ncharged him with  possession of cocaine, intending  to distribute\n\nit, in  violation of 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C)  (1988 &amp;\n\n                    \n\n     2We temporarily exclude from the inventory of unveiled items\nthe receipt  for a  Postal Service  money order,  discussed infra\n                                                                 \nPart III.\n\n                                3\n\nSupp. IV  1992).  Count  two charged him with  possessing heroin,\n\nintending to  distribute it, in  violation of the  same statutory\n\nprovisions.  Count three charged him with possession of a firearm\n\nduring and  in relation to  drug trafficking, in violation  of 18\n\nU.S.C.   924(c) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  A jury found  appellant\n\nguilty  across  the board.    On  December  10, 1992,  the  court\n\nsentenced him to concurrent 37-month terms of imprisonment on the\n\ntwo narcotics  counts and a  consecutive 60-month prison  term on\n\ncount three.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                               III\n\n          Appellant's most touted assignment of  error relates to\n\na so-called \"customer's receipt\" for a Postal Service money order\n\ndiscovered on a kitchen shelf.  The receipt bore appellant's name\n\n(although his  given name,  \"Temistocles,\" was  spelled with  two\n\nsurplus letters, viz, \"Temistomecles\"), listed his address as \"70\n                    \n\nPeace  #706 Prov. RI 02907,\" and purported to corroborate payment\n\nto \"Tower Management\"  in an amount of  $280.  In the  \"used for\"\n\nspace, someone had written \"May rent.\"\n\n          At  trial, the prosecution offered the receipt to prove\n\nthe truth  of the  matter asserted therein:   that  appellant had\n\npaid  the  apartment rent  for  May  1992     a period  when  the\n\napartment was  used as a  drug distribution outlet.   The proffer\n\nwas  unaccompanied by  testimony from  the  landlord, from  Tower\n\nManagement, from the  postal service, or,  for that matter,  from\n\nany person other  than a member of  the search party.   The lower\n\ncourt  nonetheless  admitted  the  receipt  into   evidence  over\n\n                                4\n\nappellant's timely objection  and the prosecutor used  it to good\n\neffect.  \n\n          In  this court, as below,  appellant assigns error.  He\n\ncites both  the lack of  an appropriate foundation and  the hoary\n\nprohibition   against  hearsay  evidence.     We   examine  these\n\nassertions in turn.\n\n                                A\n\n          The  logical   starting  point  for   consideration  of\n\nappellant's first asseveration is Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).  The rule\n\nreminds us that  documentary exhibits must be  authentic and that\n\n\"[t]he  requirement  of  authentication  or identification  as  a\n\ncondition precedent  to  admissibility is  satisfied by  evidence\n\nsufficient to  support a finding  that the matter in  question is\n\nwhat  its proponent  claims.\"   Fed.  R. Evid.  901(a); see  also\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Arboleda,  929 F.2d 858,  869 (1st  Cir. 1991).\n                          \n\nUnder  the Evidence  Rules,  authentication  can be  accomplished\n\nwithout  the  direct  testimony  of   either  a  custodian  or  a\n\npercipient witness.3  See  Fed. R. Evid. 903.  Thus, for example,\n                         \n\na   document's  \"[a]ppearance,   contents,  substance,   internal\n\npatterns,  or   other  distinctive   characteristics,  taken   in\n\nconjunction  with  circumstances,\"  can,  in cumulation,  provide\n\n                    \n\n     3Notwithstanding  this  possibility,  prudent  parties  will\nusually take advantage of direct testimony, especially when it is\nreadily available.   In this  case, for  example, the  government\njeopardized   the  entire   prosecution  by  not   attempting  to\nauthenticate the receipt  in better fashion.  We  should not have\nto  remind  experienced  prosecutors that,  as  Benjamin Franklin\nobserved  more than  two centuries  ago, for  want of a  nail the\nrider will sometimes be lost.\n\n                                5\n\nsufficient indicia  of reliability to  authenticate it.   Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 901(b)(4); see also United  States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944,\n                                                  \n\n947 (1st Cir. 1989).  \n\n          In  respect  to matters  of  authentication,  the trial\n\ncourt serves a gatekeeping function.  See generally Fed. R. Evid.\n                                                   \n\n104(a)   (discussing   handling  of   preliminary   questions  of\n\nadmissibility).   If  the court  discerns  enough support  in the\n\nrecord to  warrant a  reasonable person  in determining  that the\n\nevidence is what it purports to be, then Rule 901(a) is satisfied\n\nand the weight to be given  to the evidence is left to the  jury.\n\nSee United  States v. Ladd,  885 F.2d 954,  956 (1st  Cir. 1989);\n                          \n\nUnited States v. Williams, 809 F.2d 75, 89 (1st Cir. 1986), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  481 U.S.  1030 (1987);  see also  Fed. R.  Evid. 104(e).\n                                         \n\nBecause  rulings  of  this stripe  involve  the  exercise  of the\n\ndistrict  court's sound  discretion,  we  review  them  only  for\n\nmistake of law or abuse of that discretion.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMcMahon, 938 F.2d  1501, 1508 (1st Cir. 1991);  Ladd, 885 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n956;  United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d  805, 813 (1st Cir. 1987);\n                            \n\nWilliams, 809 F.2d at 89-90.\n        \n\n          In this instance,  the trial court addressed  the issue\n\nof authenticity and concluded that the receipt's contents and the\n\nattendant  circumstances warranted a finding of authenticity.  We\n\nbelieve that this determination is supportable.  The document was\n\nof a type likely  to be saved only by a  rent-payer (or, perhaps,\n\nby  a  landlord).   It  was found,  neatly  stored,  in a  small,\n\nseemingly   uninhabited  apartment.    Although  no  one  was  in\n\n                                6\n\nresidence, appellant had  been in the apartment, on  and off, for\n\nat  least two  weeks prior  to  the searchers'  discovery of  the\n\ndocument, and, importantly,  he had been seen there  in May, that\n\nis, during the rental period covered  by the receipt.  To  clinch\n\nmatters, appellant had  been in the apartment  on the day of  the\n\nearlier sale;  he was there at the time of the raid; and he alone\n\npossessed a latchkey.  The judge plausibly could infer from those\n\nfacts that  appellant had somehow  acquired a right  of occupancy\n\nin, and a degree of dominion over, the apartment.  \n\n          The  physical setting in which the document surfaced is\n\nequally  telling.  The apartment harbored a large-scale narcotics\n\noperation.   Drugs, drug  paraphernalia, and  tools of the  trade\n\nwere strewn about in plain  view.  The circumstances supported an\n\ninference  that appellant  was  part and  parcel  of the  ongoing\n\nactivities, see  infra Part IV;  and, further, that payment  in a\n                      \n\nhard-to-trace  manner,  such  as  payment  by  money  order,  was\n\ncompatible with the nature of the illicit enterprise.         \n\n          Lastly, the content  of a disputed document  may itself\n\nfurnish indicia  of authenticity.   See Newton, 891 F.2d  at 947;\n                                              \n\nsee also Fed.  R. Evid 901(b)(4).  Here,  the document's contents\n        \n\nbuttress a finding  that it is an authentic  rent receipt, issued\n\nto Paulino.  The document bears appellant's name.4   It lists the\n\ncorrect apartment  number.  And, it refers to a time frame within\n\n                    \n\n     4Appellant makes  much of the  fact that his first  name was\nmisspelled.   We do  not think that  this circumstance  possesses\ndecretory significance.   It  is altogether  unsurprising that  a\npayee would  spell a payor's  rather unusual name  incorrectly in\nscribbling a receipt.\n\n                                7\n\nwhich the drug distribution center was in operation.   \n\n          Taking the totality of  the circumstances into account,\n\nand giving due deference to the wide radius of the  trial court's\n\ndiscretion in such matters, we cannot say that the court erred in\n\nruling that,  at least  presumptively, the  document  is what  it\n\npurports to be:  a receipt evidencing appellant's payment of rent\n\nwith respect to apartment 706.\n\n                                B\n\n          Authenticity  and admissibility,  though often  closely\n\nrelated, are separate  inquiries.  The mere fact  that a document\n\nis authentic does  not necessarily mean that it  is admissible in\n\nevidence.  See United States v. De Jongh, 937 F.2d  1, 5 n.7 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1991).  We turn, then, to the question of admissibility.\n\n          In  overruling   appellant's  hearsay   objection,  the\n\ndistrict  court did not specifically identify a hearsay exclusion\n\nor  exception that  removed the  barrier  to introduction  of the\n\nevidence.    While  this  lack  of  specificity  complicates  the\n\nappellate  chore, it  does  not  require  reversal of  the  lower\n\ncourt's ruling.  If evidence  is admissible for the truth of  the\n\nmatter  asserted  under  some  cognizable  theory,  the  district\n\ncourt's failure  to articulate  that theory  will not prevent  an\n\nappellate  court from  relying upon  it.   See  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nNivica, 887  F.2d 1110, 1127  (1st Cir. 1989), cert.  denied, 494\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1005 (1990); cf. Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  859, 860-61 (1st  Cir. 1987) (explaining  that an appellate\n\ncourt is not wed to the  trial court's reasoning, but is free  to\n\n                                8\n\naffirm a  judgment on  any independently  sufficient ground  made\n\nmanifest in the record).\n\n          In the present situation, we believe the receipt can be\n\nclassified  as an  adoptive admission,  and,  therefore, that  it\n\neludes the  hearsay bar.   This analysis  depends, of  course, on\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B), which instructs  courts that when the\n\nevidence shows a party to  have \"manifested an adoption or belief\n\nin [the]  truth\" of  a statement made  by another,  the statement\n\nloses its hearsay character and becomes admissible in evidence if\n\noffered against the  adopting party.  In  applying this doctrine,\n\ncourts  frequently  have   construed  possession  of  a   written\n\nstatement as an adoption of what its contents reveal.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v. Ospina, 739  F.2d 448, 451 (9th Cir.) (involving\n                       \n\na receipt for  a hotel room),  cert. denied, 469 U.S.  887 (1984)\n                                           \n\nand 471 U.S. 1126 (1985); United States v. Marino, 658 F.2d 1120,\n                                                 \n\n1124-25  (6th   Cir.  1981)  (involving  possession   of  airline\n\ntickets).\n\n          We  think  that the  correct  approach,  exemplified by\n\nOspina, is  that \"possession  plus\" can  evidence adoption.   Put\n      \n\nanother way,  so long as  the surrounding  circumstances tie  the\n\npossessor  and the document together  in some meaningful way, the\n\npossessor may be  found to have adopted the  writing and embraced\n\nits contents.   Over and above possession, the tie is very strong\n\nhere:  appellant held the only known key to the apartment; he had\n\nfrequented the premises; the saved document bore his name; and he\n\nwas,  at  the  very  least, privy  to  the  criminal  enterprise.\n\n                                9\n\nConsequently, the record  is sufficient to permit  a finding that\n\nappellant possessed and adopted, the receipt.\n\n          We need  not wax  longiloquent.   The court of  appeals\n\nreviews a  trial  judge's admission  of evidence  over a  hearsay\n\nobjection only for abuse  of discretion.  See DCPB, Inc.  v.

R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(B)  authorized the  admission of  the receipt  as\n\nnon-hearsay  evidence against the appellant.

Sufficiency  challenges travel  a\n\nwell  defined  course  in criminal  cases.    Following a  guilty\n\nverdict,  a reviewing court  must scrutinize the  record, drawing\n\nall reasonable inferences  in favor of the  verdict, to ascertain\n\nif a  rational jury could  have found that the  government proved\n\neach element of the crime beyond a reasonable  doubt.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

To sustain  a conviction,  a reviewing\n\ncourt  need  not  conclude  that  only  a  guilty  verdict  could\n\nappropriately   be  reached;  it   is  enough  that   the  jury's\n\ndetermination draws its  essence from a plausible reading  of the\n\nrecord.  See  Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677; Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.\n                                               \n\n                                10\n\nUsing these  guideposts, the  quantum of  evidence adduced  here,\n\nthough largely circumstantial, is adequate to the task.5 \n\n          Appellant's  sufficiency  challenge  is  a weak  point,\n\neasily dispatched.  For discussion purposes, however,  it must be\n\nbifurcated  to  permit  separate analysis  of  (a)  the  two drug\n\ntrafficking counts, and (b) the firearms count.\n\n                                A\n\n          Appellant asserts that sheer happenstance placed him in\n\nharm's  way and  questions whether there  was enough  evidence to\n\nsustain a finding that he possessed cocaine and heroin, intending\n\nto  distribute   them,  as  charged   in  counts  one   and  two,\n\nrespectively.  To  convict on these  charges, the government  had\n\nthe burden  of  proving beyond  a reasonable  doubt that  Paulino\n\nknowingly and  intentionally possessed the drugs, and did so with\n\nintent to  distribute them.   See   United States v.  Barnes, 890\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  545, 549  (1st  Cir.  1989), cert.  denied,  494 U.S.  1019\n                                                \n\n(1990); see  also 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C).   Appellant\n                 \n\nsuggests that  a necessary  ingredient    guilty  knowledge    is\n\nlacking here.  To bolster  this suggestion, he labors to convince\n\nus that the  evidence shows no more than his mere presence at the\n\napartment  where the drugs were  situated.  He argues, therefore,\n\nthat the district court erred  in denying his motion for judgment\n\nof  acquittal  on both  drug  trafficking  counts.   We  are  not\n\n                    \n\n     5In  a criminal case, the government  can satisfy its burden\nof proof  by either  direct or circumstantial  evidence, or  by a\ncombination  of both.   See  Echeverri, 982  F.2d at  677; United\n                                                                 \nStates v.

See United States v. Sepulveda,     F.3d\n                                                       \n\n   ,     (1st  Cir. 1993) [No.  92-1362, slip  op. at 8]  (\"While\n\nmere presence is  not sufficient  to ground  criminal charges,  a\n\ndefendant's presence at the  point of a drug  sale, taken in  the\n\nlight of  attendant circumstances, can constitute strong evidence\n\nof  complicity.\"); Ortiz,  966 F.2d at  712 (holding  that, while\n                        \n\nmere  presence does not  establish guilt, presence  can establish\n\nguilt under circumstances where it implies participation).  Thus,\n\na  reviewing  court faced  with  a  \"mere  presence\"  claim  must\n\nevaluate  the attendant circumstances  in order to  determine the\n\nquality of  a particular defendant's presence at a location where\n\ndrugs are found.

See Ortiz,  966 F.2d  at 712-13.   We  mentioned that\n                     \n\n\"[j]urors can be assumed to know that criminals . . . rarely seek\n\nto perpetrate  felonies before  larger-than-necessary audiences.\"\n\nId. at 712 (collecting cases).

See Echeverri,  982 F.2d at 678.   Our\n                                        \n\nruling there revolved  around the defendant's proximity  to drugs\n\nand drug paraphernalia which were strewn about an apartment.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                                12\n\nid.   The  facts  of  this case  are  roughly analogous  to,  but\n   \n\nsomewhat  more   inculpatory  than,   the  facts   in  Echeverri.\n                                                                \n\nSpecifically, based on  the evidence of  record here, a  rational\n\nfactfinder plausibly could  conclude that appellant had  dominion\n\nover  apartment 706; that he actually or constructively possessed\n\nthe contraband located  therein; that he  intended the drugs  for\n\ndistribution;6 that  his  participation  in  the  enterprise  was\n\nknowing and willful;  and that, accordingly, his  presence during\n\nthe controlled  buy, and at  the time of  the raid, was  culpable\n\nrather than  innocent.   See, e.g., Echeverri,  982 F.2d  at 678;\n                                             \n\nUnited  States v.

This attack    which  boils down  to a\n\nclaim that the evidence fails to show he \"used\" or \"carried\"  the\n\nfirearm  in connection with drug trafficking activities   ignores\n\nsettled law in this circuit and elsewhere.   Under the statute of\n\nconviction, 18  U.S.C.   924(c),  the emphasis is on  a firearm's\n\navailability for use,  regardless of whether it is actually used.\n\nThus, in United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987 (1st Cir. 1990),\n                                  \n\ncert. denied, 111  S.

Expert testimony established  that the\ndrugs were for  distribution rather than  personal use, and  that\ntheir  value  exceeded  $6,000.    On  appeal,  Paulino  has  not\nchallenged either the admission or the import of this testimony.\n\n                                13\n\nwe made it pellucid that, where a drug trafficker is not carrying\n\na gun  on his  person but  has one  nearby, the  court's critical\n\nconcern  should  not   be  whether  the  weapon   was  \"instantly\n\navailable\" or \"exclusively dedicated to the narcotics trade,\" but\n\nwhether  it was  \"available  for  use\"  in  connection  with  the\n\nnarcotics trade.  Id.  at 998; see  also Smith v. United  States,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. 2050,  2059 (1993) (explaining that a weapon meets the\n\nstatutory test if  its presence, rather than  being accidental or\n\ncoincidental, facilitates, or has  the potential of facilitating,\n\nthe drug  trafficking offense).   We  think the  case at  hand is\n\nlargely governed by Hadfield.\n                            \n\n          Paulino  was  apprehended in  an  outwardly uninhabited\n\napartment that  served    or so the  jury supportably  could have\n\nfound   as a place from which drugs were being sold.  Drugs, drug\n\nparaphernalia,  and a  loaded  revolver  were  located  in  close\n\nproximity to  one another.   Paulino had  an apparent  possessory\n\ninterest  in,  and a  significant  degree  of control  over,  the\n\npremises.   On  these facts,  a  reasonable factfinder  certainly\n\ncould find  the requisite facilitative  nexus, that is,  that the\n\ngun  was kept in the  apartment to be  \"available for use\" during\n\nand in  relation to the  ongoing drug  peddling.  See  Abreu, 952\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1466 (\"Even though a weapon is never fired, if it is kept\n\nnearby by  a  drug dealer,  it is  'used' so  as  to satisfy  the\n\nstatutory requirement.\"); United States  v.

And  the  jury also  could conclude,  without\n\n                                14\n\ndiscernible difficulty, that appellant knew  of the gun, the drug\n\ntrafficking,  and the obvious relationship between  the two.

Having reviewed the record, we decline to disturb the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* This case finds its genesis in an undercover investigation of narcotics trafficking conducted by the Providence, Rhode Island police department.  The investigation focused on an apartment building at 70 Peace Street.  In due course, the police began paying special attention to apartment 706.  On several occasions in late May and early June of 1992, they observed appellant in and around the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After intensive surveillance, an informant, acting under police auspices, entered apartment 706 during early June and made a controlled purchase of cocaine from the principal suspect, Moreno, inside the apartment.  While the transaction was in progress detectives observed Paulino peering from a window.  The officers subsequently obtained a search warrant and executed it on June 11, 1992.  They discovered appellant in the kitchen and a stranger, Junior Rodriguez, taking a shower.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The man known as \"Moreno\" was elsewhere when the police arrived, and his whereabouts remain a mystery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the tiny apartment contained little more than a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, it nevertheless disclosed bountiful evidence of drug trafficking activities.  Detectives found an assortment of drugs in the bedroom, namely, three plastic bags containing 64.02 grams of cocaine in the aggregate, and a fourth bag containing a \"speedball\" (a mixture of cocaine and heroin) weighing 11.79 grams.  The search party found the speedball perched on a small coffee table, inside a five-pound bag of rice;  on a piece of foil next to the rice rested a rock of cocaine weighing 95.11 grams.  The rock showed signs of having recently been \"cooked\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search uncovered more than the narcotics cache.  From atop the coffee table, the police confiscated a collection of drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale, three sifters, a playing card, packaging materials, three separate kinds of cutting agents, and a small notebook that appeared to be a drug ledger.  On a chair next to the table, under a shirt, within easy reaching distance of the drugs, officers spotted a loaded revolver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On appellant's person, officers found a key to the apartment's front door.  No other key to the apartment was located.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based primarily on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against appellant.  Count one charged him with possession of cocaine, intending to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  Count two charged him with possessing heroin, intending to distribute it, in violation of the same statutory provisions.  Count three charged him with possession of a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  A jury found appellant guilty across the board.  On December 10, 1992, the court sentenced him to concurrent 37-month terms of imprisonment on the two narcotics counts and a consecutive 60-month prison term on count three.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's most touted assignment of error relates to a so-called \"customer's receipt\" for a Postal Service money order discovered on a kitchen shelf.  The receipt bore appellant's name (although his given name, \"Temistocles,\" was spelled with two surplus letters, viz, \"Temistomecles\"), listed his address as \"70 Peace $ 706 Prov.  RI 02907,\" and purported to corroborate payment to \"Tower Management\" in an amount of $280.  In the \"used for\" space, someone had written \"May rent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution offered the receipt to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein:  that appellant had paid the apartment rent for May 1992--a period when the apartment was used as a drug distribution outlet.  The proffer was unaccompanied by testimony from the landlord, from Tower Management, from the postal service, or, for that matter, from any person other than a member of the search party.  The lower court nonetheless admitted the receipt into evidence over appellant's timely objection and the prosecutor used it to good effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, appellant assigns error.  He cites both the lack of an appropriate foundation and the hoary prohibition against hearsay evidence.  We examine these assertions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The logical starting point for consideration of appellant's first asseveration is Fed.R.Evid. 901(a).  The rule reminds us that documentary exhibits must be authentic and that \"[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 901(a);  see also United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858, 869 (1st Cir.1991).  Under the Evidence Rules, authentication can be accomplished without the direct testimony of either a custodian or a percipient witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Fed.R.Evid. 903.  Thus, for example, a document's \"[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances,\" can, in cumulation, provide sufficient indicia of reliability to authenticate it.  Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4);  see also United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to matters of authentication, the trial court serves a gatekeeping function.  See generally Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) (discussing handling of preliminary questions of admissibility).  If the court discerns enough support in the record to warrant a reasonable person in determining that the evidence is what it purports to be, then Rule 901(a) is satisfied and the weight to be given to the evidence is left to the jury.  See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 956 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Williams, 809 F.2d 75, 89 (1st Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1030, 107 S.Ct. 1959, 95 L.Ed.2d 531 (1987);  see also Fed.R.Evid. 104(e).  Because rulings of this stripe involve the exercise of the district court's sound discretion, we review them only for mistake of law or abuse of that discretion.  See United States v. McMahon, 938 F.2d 1501, 1508 (1st Cir.1991);  Ladd, 885 F.2d at 956;  United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 813 (1st Cir.1987);  Williams, 809 F.2d at 89-90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the trial court addressed the issue of authenticity and concluded that the receipt's contents and the attendant circumstances warranted a finding of authenticity.  We believe that this determination is supportable.  The document was of a type likely to be saved only by a rent-payer (or, perhaps, by a landlord).  It was found, neatly stored, in a small, seemingly uninhabited apartment.  Although no one was in residence, appellant had been in the apartment, on and off, for at least two weeks prior to the searchers' discovery of the document, and, importantly, he had been seen there in May, that is, during the rental period covered by the receipt.  To clinch matters, appellant had been in the apartment on the day of the earlier sale;  he was there at the time of the raid;  and he alone possessed a latchkey.  The judge plausibly could infer from those facts that appellant had somehow acquired a right of occupancy in, and a degree of dominion over, the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The physical setting in which the document surfaced is equally telling.  The apartment harbored a large-scale narcotics operation.  Drugs, drug paraphernalia, and tools of the trade were strewn about in plain view.  The circumstances supported an inference that appellant was part and parcel of the ongoing activities, see infra Part IV;  and, further, that payment in a hard-to-trace manner, such as payment by money order, was compatible with the nature of the illicit enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the content of a disputed document may itself furnish indicia of authenticity.  See Newton, 891 F.2d at 947;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4).  Here, the document's contents buttress a finding that it is an authentic rent receipt, issued to Paulino.  The document bears appellant's name.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It lists the correct apartment number.  And, it refers to a time frame within which the drug distribution center was in operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the totality of the circumstances into account, and giving due deference to the wide radius of the trial court's discretion in such matters, we cannot say that the court erred in ruling that, at least presumptively, the document is what it purports to be:  a receipt evidencing appellant's payment of rent with respect to apartment 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Authenticity and admissibility, though often closely related, are separate inquiries.  The mere fact that a document is authentic does not necessarily mean that it is admissible in evidence.  See United States v. De Jongh, 937 F.2d 1, 5 n. 7 (1st Cir.1991).  We turn, then, to the question of admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In overruling appellant's hearsay objection, the district court did not specifically identify a hearsay exclusion or exception that removed the barrier to introduction of the evidence.  While this lack of specificity complicates the appellate chore, it does not require reversal of the lower court's ruling.  If evidence is admissible for the truth of the matter asserted under some cognizable theory, the district court's failure to articulate that theory will not prevent an appellate court from relying upon it.  See United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 1300, 108 L.Ed.2d 477 (1990);  cf. Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that an appellate court is not wed to the trial court's reasoning, but is free to affirm a judgment on any independently sufficient ground made manifest in the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present situation, we believe the receipt can be classified as an adoptive admission, and, therefore, that it eludes the hearsay bar.  This analysis depends, of course, on Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B), which instructs courts that when the evidence shows a party to have \"manifested an adoption or belief in [the] truth\" of a statement made by another, the statement loses its hearsay character and becomes admissible in evidence if offered against the adopting party.  In applying this doctrine, courts frequently have construed possession of a written statement as an adoption of what its contents reveal.  See, e.g., United States v. Ospina, 739 F.2d 448, 451 (9th Cir.)  (involving a receipt for a hotel room), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 887, 105 S.Ct. 262, 83 L.Ed.2d 198 (1984) and 471 U.S. 1126, 105 S.Ct. 2658, 86 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985);  United States v. Marino, 658 F.2d 1120, 1124-25 (6th Cir.1981) (involving possession of airline tickets).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the correct approach, exemplified by Ospina, is that \"possession plus\" can evidence adoption.  Put another way, so long as the surrounding circumstances tie the possessor and the document together in some meaningful way, the possessor may be found to have adopted the writing and embraced its contents.  Over and above possession, the tie is very strong here:  appellant held the only known key to the apartment;  he had frequented the premises;  the saved document bore his name;  and he was, at the very least, privy to the criminal enterprise.  Consequently, the record is sufficient to permit a finding that appellant possessed and adopted, the receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent.  The court of appeals reviews a trial judge's admission of evidence over a hearsay objection only for abuse of discretion.  See DCPB, Inc. v. City of Lebanon, 957 F.2d 913, 918 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1467 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1695, 118 L.Ed.2d 406 (1992).  We are satisfied that, in this instance, Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) authorized the admission of the receipt as non-hearsay evidence against the appellant.  The district court, therefore, did not outstrip the bounds of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final assignment of error questions the sufficiency of the evidence.  Sufficiency challenges travel a well defined course in criminal cases.  Following a guilty verdict, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993).  To sustain a conviction, a reviewing court need not conclude that only a guilty verdict could appropriately be reached;  it is enough that the jury's determination draws its essence from a plausible reading of the record.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.   Using these guideposts, the quantum of evidence adduced here, though largely circumstantial, is adequate to the task.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's sufficiency challenge is a weak point, easily dispatched.  For discussion purposes, however, it must be bifurcated to permit separate analysis of (a) the two drug trafficking counts, and (b) the firearms count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Appellant asserts that sheer happenstance placed him in harm's way and questions whether there was enough evidence to sustain a finding that he possessed cocaine and heroin, intending to distribute them, as charged in counts one and two, respectively.  To convict on these charges, the government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Paulino knowingly and intentionally possessed the drugs, and did so with intent to distribute them.  See United States v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1019, 110 S.Ct. 1326, 108 L.Ed.2d 501 (1990);  see also 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C).  Appellant suggests that a necessary ingredient--guilty knowledge--is lacking here.  To bolster this suggestion, he labors to convince us that the evidence shows no more than his mere presence at the apartment where the drugs were situated.  He argues, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on both drug trafficking counts.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has recognized the difference between \"mere presence\" and \"culpable presence\" in the context of drug trafficking activities.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.1993) (\"While mere presence is not sufficient to ground criminal charges, a defendant's presence at the point of a drug sale, taken in the light of attendant circumstances, can constitute strong evidence of complicity.\");  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 712 (holding that, while mere presence does not establish guilt, presence can establish guilt under circumstances where it implies participation).  Thus, a reviewing court faced with a \"mere presence\" claim must evaluate the attendant circumstances in order to determine the quality of a particular defendant's presence at a location where drugs are found.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ortiz, we concluded that evidence of a defendant's participation in a dialogue between a buyer and a seller of illicit drugs was enough to warrant a finding of more than mere presence.  See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 712-13.   We mentioned that \"[j]urors can be assumed to know that criminals ... rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences.\"  Id. at 712 (collecting cases).  In Echeverri--a case that evokes comparisons with the case at bar--we also held that culpable presence could be found.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678.   Our ruling there revolved around the defendant's proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia which were strewn about an apartment.  See id.   The facts of this case are roughly analogous to, but somewhat more inculpatory than, the facts in Echeverri.   Specifically, based on the evidence of record here, a rational factfinder plausibly could conclude that appellant had dominion over apartment 706;  that he actually or constructively possessed the contraband located therein;  that he intended the drugs for distribution;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  that his participation in the enterprise was knowing and willful;  and that, accordingly, his presence during the controlled buy, and at the time of the raid, was culpable rather than innocent.  See, e.g., Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678;  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Glover, 814 F.2d 15, 16-17 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final aspect of appellant's sufficiency challenge relates to count three.  This attack--which boils down to a claim that the evidence fails to show he \"used\" or \"carried\" the firearm in connection with drug trafficking activities--ignores settled law in this circuit and elsewhere.  Under the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c), the emphasis is on a firearm's availability for use, regardless of whether it is actually used.  Thus, in United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991), a section 924(c)(1) case, we made it pellucid that, where a drug trafficker is not carrying a gun on his person but has one nearby, the court's critical concern should not be whether the weapon was \"instantly available\" or \"exclusively dedicated to the narcotics trade,\" but whether it was \"available for use\" in connection with the narcotics trade.  Id. at 998;  see also Smith v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2059, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (explaining that a weapon meets the statutory test if its presence, rather than being accidental or coincidental, facilitates, or has the potential of facilitating, the drug trafficking offense).  We think the case at hand is largely governed by Hadfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paulino was apprehended in an outwardly uninhabited apartment that served--or so the jury supportably could have found--as a place from which drugs were being sold.  Drugs, drug paraphernalia, and a loaded revolver were located in close proximity to one another.  Paulino had an apparent possessory interest in, and a significant degree of control over, the premises.  On these facts, a reasonable factfinder certainly could find the requisite facilitative nexus, that is, that the gun was kept in the apartment to be \"available for use\" during and in relation to the ongoing drug peddling.  See Abreu, 952 F.2d at 1466 (\"Even though a weapon is never fired, if it is kept nearby by a drug dealer, it is 'used' so as to satisfy the statutory requirement.\");  United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983 (1st Cir.1992) (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993).  And the jury also could conclude, without discernible difficulty, that appellant knew of the gun, the drug trafficking, and the obvious relationship between the two.  See generally Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679 (reaffirming that \"criminal juries are not expected to ignore what is perfectly obvious\").  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

The investigation focused on an apartment building at 70 Peace Street.  In due course, the police began paying special attention to apartment 706.  On several occasions in late May and early June of 1992, they observed appellant in and around the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After intensive surveillance, an informant, acting under police auspices, entered apartment 706 during early June and made a controlled purchase of cocaine from the principal suspect, Moreno, inside the apartment.  While the transaction was in progress detectives observed Paulino peering from a window.  The officers subsequently obtained a search warrant and executed it on June 11, 1992.  They discovered appellant in the kitchen and a stranger, Junior Rodriguez, taking a shower.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The man known as \"Moreno\" was elsewhere when the police arrived, and his whereabouts remain a mystery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the tiny apartment contained little more than a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, it nevertheless disclosed bountiful evidence of drug trafficking activities.  Detectives found an assortment of drugs in the bedroom, namely, three plastic bags containing 64.02 grams of cocaine in the aggregate, and a fourth bag containing a \"speedball\" (a mixture of cocaine and heroin) weighing 11.79 grams.  The search party found the speedball perched on a small coffee table, inside a five-pound bag of rice;  on a piece of foil next to the rice rested a rock of cocaine weighing 95.11 grams.  The rock showed signs of having recently been \"cooked\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search uncovered more than the narcotics cache.  From atop the coffee table, the police confiscated a collection of drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale, three sifters, a playing card, packaging materials, three separate kinds of cutting agents, and a small notebook that appeared to be a drug ledger.  On a chair next to the table, under a shirt, within easy reaching distance of the drugs, officers spotted a loaded revolver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On appellant's person, officers found a key to the apartment's front door.  No other key to the apartment was located.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based primarily on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against appellant.  Count one charged him with possession of cocaine, intending to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  Count two charged him with possessing heroin, intending to distribute it, in violation of the same statutory provisions.  Count three charged him with possession of a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  A jury found appellant guilty across the board.  On December 10, 1992, the court sentenced him to concurrent 37-month terms of imprisonment on the two narcotics counts and a consecutive 60-month prison term on count three.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's most touted assignment of error relates to a so-called \"customer's receipt\" for a Postal Service money order discovered on a kitchen shelf.  The receipt bore appellant's name (although his given name, \"Temistocles,\" was spelled with two surplus letters, viz, \"Temistomecles\"), listed his address as \"70 Peace $ 706 Prov.  RI 02907,\" and purported to corroborate payment to \"Tower Management\" in an amount of $280.  In the \"used for\" space, someone had written \"May rent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution offered the receipt to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein:  that appellant had paid the apartment rent for May 1992--a period when the apartment was used as a drug distribution outlet.  The proffer was unaccompanied by testimony from the landlord, from Tower Management, from the postal service, or, for that matter, from any person other than a member of the search party.  The lower court nonetheless admitted the receipt into evidence over appellant's timely objection and the prosecutor used it to good effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, appellant assigns error.  He cites both the lack of an appropriate foundation and the hoary prohibition against hearsay evidence.  We examine these assertions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The logical starting point for consideration of appellant's first asseveration is Fed.R.Evid. 901(a).  The rule reminds us that documentary exhibits must be authentic and that \"[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 901(a);  see also United States v. Arboleda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558577\"><a href=\"/opinion/558577/united-states-v-carlos-arboleda-united-states-v-martin-castillo-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 869 (1st Cir.1991).  Under the Evidence Rules, authentication can be accomplished without the direct testimony of either a custodian or a percipient witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Fed.R.Evid. 903.  Thus, for example, a document's \"[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances,\" can, in cumulation, provide sufficient indicia of reliability to authenticate it.  Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4);  see also United States v.

See generally Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) (discussing handling of preliminary questions of admissibility).  If the court discerns enough support in the record to warrant a reasonable person in determining that the evidence is what it purports to be, then Rule 901(a) is satisfied and the weight to be given to the evidence is left to the jury.

We believe that this determination is supportable.  The document was of a type likely to be saved only by a rent-payer (or, perhaps, by a landlord).  It was found, neatly stored, in a small, seemingly uninhabited apartment.  Although no one was in residence, appellant had been in the apartment, on and off, for at least two weeks prior to the searchers' discovery of the document, and, importantly, he had been seen there in May, that is, during the rental period covered by the receipt.  To clinch matters, appellant had been in the apartment on the day of the earlier sale;  he was there at the time of the raid;  and he alone possessed a latchkey.  The judge plausibly could infer from those facts that appellant had somehow acquired a right of occupancy in, and a degree of dominion over, the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The physical setting in which the document surfaced is equally telling.  The apartment harbored a large-scale narcotics operation.  Drugs, drug paraphernalia, and tools of the trade were strewn about in plain view.  The circumstances supported an inference that appellant was part and parcel of the ongoing activities, see infra Part IV;  and, further, that payment in a hard-to-trace manner, such as payment by money order, was compatible with the nature of the illicit enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the content of a disputed document may itself furnish indicia of authenticity.  See Newton, 891 F.2d at 947;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4).  Here, the document's contents buttress a finding that it is an authentic rent receipt, issued to Paulino.  The document bears appellant's name.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It lists the correct apartment number.  And, it refers to a time frame within which the drug distribution center was in operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the totality of the circumstances into account, and giving due deference to the wide radius of the trial court's discretion in such matters, we cannot say that the court erred in ruling that, at least presumptively, the document is what it purports to be:  a receipt evidencing appellant's payment of rent with respect to apartment 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Authenticity and admissibility, though often closely related, are separate inquiries.  The mere fact that a document is authentic does not necessarily mean that it is admissible in evidence.  See United States v. De Jongh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563787\"><a href=\"/opinion/563787/united-states-v-maria-enriqueta-cirila-trinidad-de-jongh/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 n. 7 (1st Cir.1991).

While this lack of specificity complicates the appellate chore, it does not require reversal of the lower court's ruling.  If evidence is admissible for the truth of the matter asserted under some cognizable theory, the district court's failure to articulate that theory will not prevent an appellate court from relying upon it.

This analysis depends, of course, on Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B), which instructs courts that when the evidence shows a party to have \"manifested an adoption or belief in [the] truth\" of a statement made by another, the statement loses its hearsay character and becomes admissible in evidence if offered against the adopting party.  In applying this doctrine, courts frequently have construed possession of a written statement as an adoption of what its contents reveal.  See, e.g., United States v. Ospina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438942\"><a href=\"/opinion/438942/united-states-v-jose-rodriguez-ospina-united-states-of-america-v-oilsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 451 (9th Cir.)

Put another way, so long as the surrounding circumstances tie the possessor and the document together in some meaningful way, the possessor may be found to have adopted the writing and embraced its contents.  Over and above possession, the tie is very strong here:  appellant held the only known key to the apartment;  he had frequented the premises;  the saved document bore his name;  and he was, at the very least, privy to the criminal enterprise.  Consequently, the record is sufficient to permit a finding that appellant possessed and adopted, the receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent.  The court of appeals reviews a trial judge's admission of evidence over a hearsay objection only for abuse of discretion.  See DCPB, Inc. v.

We are satisfied that, in this instance, Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) authorized the admission of the receipt as non-hearsay evidence against the appellant.  The district court, therefore, did not outstrip the bounds of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final assignment of error questions the sufficiency of the evidence.  Sufficiency challenges travel a well defined course in criminal cases.  Following a guilty verdict, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

To sustain a conviction, a reviewing court need not conclude that only a guilty verdict could appropriately be reached;  it is enough that the jury's determination draws its essence from a plausible reading of the record.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.   Using these guideposts, the quantum of evidence adduced here, though largely circumstantial, is adequate to the task.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's sufficiency challenge is a weak point, easily dispatched.

To convict on these charges, the government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Paulino knowingly and intentionally possessed the drugs, and did so with intent to distribute them.

To bolster this suggestion, he labors to convince us that the evidence shows no more than his mere presence at the apartment where the drugs were situated.  He argues, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on both drug trafficking counts.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has recognized the difference between \"mere presence\" and \"culpable presence\" in the context of drug trafficking activities.

Thus, a reviewing court faced with a \"mere presence\" claim must evaluate the attendant circumstances in order to determine the quality of a particular defendant's presence at a location where drugs are found.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ortiz, we concluded that evidence of a defendant's participation in a dialogue between a buyer and a seller of illicit drugs was enough to warrant a finding of more than mere presence.  See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 712-13.   We mentioned that \"[j]urors can be assumed to know that criminals ... rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences.\"  Id. at 712 (collecting cases).  In Echeverri--a case that evokes comparisons with the case at bar--we also held that culpable presence could be found.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678.   Our ruling there revolved around the defendant's proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia which were strewn about an apartment.  See id.   The facts of this case are roughly analogous to, but somewhat more inculpatory than, the facts in Echeverri.   Specifically, based on the evidence of record here, a rational factfinder plausibly could conclude that appellant had dominion over apartment 706;  that he actually or constructively possessed the contraband located therein;  that he intended the drugs for distribution;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  that his participation in the enterprise was knowing and willful;  and that, accordingly, his presence during the controlled buy, and at the time of the raid, was culpable rather than innocent.

This attack--which boils down to a claim that the evidence fails to show he \"used\" or \"carried\" the firearm in connection with drug trafficking activities--ignores settled law in this circuit and elsewhere.  Under the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c), the emphasis is on a firearm's availability for use, regardless of whether it is actually used.  Thus, in United States v.

On these facts, a reasonable factfinder certainly could find the requisite facilitative nexus, that is, that the gun was kept in the apartment to be \"available for use\" during and in relation to the ongoing drug peddling.  See Abreu, 952 F.2d at 1466 (\"Even though a weapon is never fired, if it is kept nearby by a drug dealer, it is 'used' so as to satisfy the statutory requirement.\");  United States v.
