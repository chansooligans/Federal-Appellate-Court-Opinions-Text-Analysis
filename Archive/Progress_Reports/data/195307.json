A jury found defendant Daniel\n                                 \n\nTavares guilty of  being a  felon in possession  of a firearm  in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  The statute makes it a crime\n\nfor any  person \"who has been  convicted in any court  of a crime\n\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to\n\n.   .  .  possess  in  or  affecting  commerce,  any  firearm  or\n\nammunition.\"1  At  trial, defendant offered  to stipulate to  the\n\nfact that he had such a prior conviction.  The prosecutor refused\n\nto  accept the  stipulation.  On  the basis  of our  decisions in\n\nUnited  States v.  Collamore, 868  F.2d 24  (1st Cir.  1989), and\n                            \n\nUnited States v. Donlon, 909 F.2d 650  (1st Cir. 1990), the court\n                       \n\nallowed the prosecutor to  introduce, in addition to the  fact of\n\nthe  prior conviction,  evidence of  its nature  -- larceny  of a\n\nfirearm.  \n\n     A  panel of  this court,  two members concluding  that under\n\nCollamore and Donlon the  district court did not err  in allowing\n                    \n\nthe  government   to  reject  the  stipulation   and  one  member\n\nconcluding the  contrary,  unanimously agreed  that \"the  precise\n\nissue in our case was not the subject of a  focused discussion in\n\nthe prior decisions, that the issue is an important and recurring\n\none, and that en banc consideration of the issue is appropriate.\"\n\nThe  full court  accordingly  granted  rehearing and  entertained\n\nfurther briefing and argument.  We now conclude that the district\n\n                    \n\n1Although the predicate  crime may  not be a  felony, the  common\nreference which we adopt is a \"felon-in-possession\" offense.\n\n                               -2-\n\ncourt  abused  its discretion  in  permitting  the government  to\n\nreject the offered stipulation.\n\n     We set forth only the facts essential for  understanding the\n\nbasic issue that concerns us.  The government's evidence at trial\n\nindicated  that the  defendant was  involved in  three escalating\n\nconfrontations,  culminating  with a  shooting  incident, on  the\n\nnight  of  August  28-29,   1991,  at  a  Mashpee,  Massachusetts\n\napartment  complex.    The   first  two  confrontations  involved\n\nacrimonious discussions in which  Tavares was accused of stealing\n\na  car radio.    The government  also  alleged that  Tavares  was\n\ninvolved in a  third incident, in  which he  accosted with a  gun\n\nanother acquaintance  who had engaged  in a  discussion with  him\n\nabout the  radio theft,  and then  fired at  the outside of  this\n\nindividual's  apartment  building.     Damage  was  done  to  two\n\nautomobiles.  \n\n     Tavares was shortly thereafter seen running in a wooded area\n\nand  arrested.   An  officer assisted  by  a police  tracking dog\n\nsubsequently  located  a  shotgun  and  rifle  in  nearby  woods.\n\nForensic evidence showed that the shotgun had fired shells  found\n\nnear  the damaged cars.  Tavares was convicted following a three-\n\nday  trial.   As  noted earlier,  the  prosecutor was  allowed to\n\nintroduce evidence  that Tavares  had been  convicted of a  prior\n\ncrime,  larceny  of  a  firearm,  and  had  received  a  two-year\n\nsentence.  \n\n     Our  first task is  to reexamine our two  cases on which the\n\ndistrict court relied, Collamore and Donlon, to determine whether\n                                           \n\n                               -3-\n\nthey remain  compelling authority.    As we  have indicated,  the\n\ndistrict  court determined  that it  was constrained  under these\n\ncases to accord the  government the absolute right to  reject the\n\ndefendant's proffered stipulation.2  \n\n     In  Donlon, our more recent opinion, we dealt at length with\n               \n\nthe  defendant's  claim  that   grand  jury  testimony  had  been\n\nunlawfully admitted  at trial.  Then, as to a number of secondary\n\nissues, we briefly indicated their disposition and our reasoning.\n\nOn the issue of  the government's right to introduce  evidence of\n\nthe nature of the predicate crime, we merely cited Collamore.  In\n                                                            \n\nCollamore, decided  a year  earlier, the  question before  us was\n         \n\nwhether the court could  bifurcate a felon-in-possession trial by\n\nrequiring  the government to prove  the possession element of the\n\ncharge  before presenting to  the jury  proof of  the defendant's\n\ncriminal  record.   We  held  that  a court  may  not  do so  and\n\nreversed.     We  observed  that  barring   the  government  from\n\npresenting  any  evidence  of  a  prior  felony  in  a  felon-in-\n\npossession  case effectively \"eliminated  an essential element of\n\nthe  government's  case,\" 868  F.2d  at 27,  and  thus improperly\n\ndeprived the government of a jury trial on the crime  as charged,\n\nid.  at 28.   In support  of our conclusion,  we added by  way of\n   \n\ndictum  that  \"even in  the face  of an  offer to  stipulate, the\n\n                    \n\n2  We note that the  court endeavored to  minimize any prejudice.\nIt  received into  evidence  a certified  copy  of Tavares'  1988\nconviction,  but  did  not  permit  the government  to  read  the\ndocument to the jury.   The court also repeatedly  instructed the\njury  that the evidence was  relevant only as  proof of the prior\nfelony element of the charge.\n\n                               -4-\n\ngovernment  may  choose to  present  evidence on  the  one felony\n\nnecessary to prove the crime charged,\" id. at 28.  \n                                          \n\n     Although we stand by and reaffirm the proposition central in\n\nCollamore,  that a  defendant may  not use  a stipulation  or any\n         \n\nother procedural  device, including bifurcation,  to remove  from\n\nhis   felon-in-possession  prosecution  the  fact  of  his  prior\n                                                 \n\nconviction, we  now realize upon reconsideration  that our dictum\n\nrested on a  shaky foundation.  In Collamore, we  relied on three\n                                            \n\ncases, two  from the Sixth  Circuit, United States  v. Blackburn,\n                                                                \n\n592 F.2d 300, 301 (6th Cir. 1979); and United States v. Burkhart,\n                                                                \n\n545 F.2d 14, 15 (6th Cir. 1976); and one from the Eighth Circuit,\n\nUnited States v. Bruton, 647 F.2d 818, 825 (8th Cir. 1981), which\n                       \n\nin turn ultimately relied upon United States v. Brickey, 426 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n680,  685-86 (8th  Cir.  1970).3   The  question in  Brickey  was\n                                                            \n\nwhether,  in  proving  the  crime  giving  rise  to  the  instant\n\nprosecution, the government may be forced to accept a stipulation\n\n(\"a naked admission\") in lieu of presenting a full picture of the\n\nevents and mind sets in question.       The defendant  in Brickey\n                                                                 \n\nhad been indicted  for mail fraud and sought to  stipulate to the\n\nfact that  he had diverted funds so  as to exclude evidence about\n\nhis personal use of the money.   The Brickey panel found no abuse\n                                            \n\nof  discretion  in the  trial  court's  refusal  to  require  the\n\ngovernment to  accept the  stipulation, and quoted  the following\n\n                    \n\n3  Burkhart and Bruton actually cited United States v. Smith, 520\n                                                            \nF.2d 544 (8th Cir. 1975), which, in turn, relied upon Brickey.\n                                                             \n\n                               -5-\n\npassage  from Parr v.  United States, 255  F.2d 86, 88  (5th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1958):\n\n     \"It is a general rule that `A party  is not required to\n     accept a  judicial admission of his  adversary, but may\n     insist on proving the fact.'  31 C.J.S. Evidence   299,\n     p. 1068.  The reason for  the rule is to permit a party\n     `to  present to the jury a picture of the events relied\n     upon.  To substitute for such picture a naked admission\n     might  have the effect to  rob the evidence  of much of\n     its fair and legitimate weight.'\"\n\n426 F.2d at 686.\n\n     Brickey,  the sole  underpinning of  the cases  on  which we\n            \n\nrelied in Collamore, is critically different from the case before\n                   \n\nus.    While  the  stipulation  there  concerned  facts  directly\n\nrelevant  to the  instant crime,  the case  before us  involves a\n\nstipulation to  facts establishing  only the  defendant's status.\n\nThis  difference  is  so  significant  that  we  no  longer  deem\n\nCollamore's dictum to be compelling in cases such as this.\n         \n\n     As  we now reconsider the issue fully, we begin our analysis\n\nby  reiterating its  limited  scope.    A  decision  to  honor  a\n\nstipulation  concerning   the  predicate  crime  in  a  felon-in-\n\npossession  case in  no  way  trenches  upon  the  right  of  the\n\nprosecution to  make a full  presentation of the  crime currently\n\ncharged.  We fully concede the government's \"right to `present to\n\nthe jury a picture of the  events relied upon,'\" United States v.\n                                                              \n\nDoherty, 675 F. Supp. 714, 717 (D. Mass. 1987), aff'd in part and\n                                                                 \n\nrev'd in  part, 867 F.2d 47  (1st Cir. 1989),  including proof of\n              \n\nall  elements of  the  crime for  which  the defendant  has  been\n\nbrought to trial.   The prosecution ordinarily may not  be forced\n\nto  eliminate  gruesome details  of  a killing,  the  quantity of\n\n                               -6-\n\ndrugs, or the  degree of malevolence  exhibited by the  defendant\n\nthrough a defense-proffered stipulation.\n\n     This well-established right of the government to present its\n\ncase  as it  sees fit is  in no  fashion weakened  by requiring a\n\nstipulation  to establish the defendant's status as a felon.  The\n\nstatus  element is  a discrete  and independent component  of the\n\ncrime,  a requirement  reflecting  a  Congressional  policy  that\n\npossession  of a  firearm is  categorically prohibited  for those\n\nindividuals  who have  been  convicted of  a  wide assortment  of\n\ncrimes calling for a punishment of over a year's imprisonment.  A\n\ndefendant  falls within  the category  simply by  virtue of  past\n\nconviction  for  any  crime  ranging  from  possession  of  short\n\nlobsters,  see 16 U.S.C.    3372, to the  most aggravated murder.\n              \n\nThe predicate  crime is  significant only to  demonstrate status,\n\nand a full picture of that  offense is -- even if not prejudicial\n\n-- beside the point.\n\n     This is  not a situation in  which there is only  one way to\n\nprove this status, e.g., by  the full record conviction including\n\nthe nature of the offense.  Other ways include a redacted record,\n\ntestimony by  a clerk,  stipulation, a defendant's  affidavit, or\n\neven, in the absence of controversy, judicial notice of the prior\n\nconviction.    None of  these  alternatives  is  tainted  by  the\n\ninclusion of the prejudicial information.\n\n     The  government suggests  that, beyond  establishing status,\n\nthe predicate crime serves to crystallize  the culpability of the\n\ndefendant  as a serious offender.   It asserts  that knowledge of\n\n                               -7-\n\nthe nature of the predicate crime in this way bears on the jury's\n\nability  to  evaluate  the  defendant's guilt  on  the  felon-in-\n\npossession charge, and thus is relevant to its deliberations.\n\n     We fail to see  this connection.  Relevant evidence,  we are\n\ntold  by Federal Rule of Evidence 401, \"means evidence having any\n\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\n\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable\n\nthan  it would  be without  the evidence.\"   The  fact concerning\n\ndefendant's  prior criminal  record that    922(g)(1)  explicitly\n\nmakes  \"of consequence\" is whether it includes a crime carrying a\n\npenalty of more than a year's imprisonment.   It does not embrace\n\nadditional facts such as  a particular kind of felony.   Congress\n\nrequired no  gradation for  seriousness,  numerosity or  recency,\n\nalthough  such distinctions  have  in other  contexts been  given\n\nsignificance.  See, e.g.,  18 U.S.C.   924(c) (penalizing  use of\n                        \n\nfirearm in connection with crime of  violence or drug trafficking\n\ncrime);   924(e)(1)  (increasing firearms possession penalty  for\n\ndefendant convicted  of  multiple violent  felonies or  \"serious\"\n\ndrug offenses).\n\n     In effect,  we understand the government  to claim relevance\n\nin revelation of a crime that is particularly egregious (murder),\n\nsocially   opprobrious   (pornography),  systemically   dangerous\n\n(organized  crime),  or  similar  to the  crime  occasioning  the\n\npresent prosecution  (possession of firearms).  It is, of course,\n\nhighly  likely  that such  evidence  would  influence the  jury's\n\nperception of the  defendant, suggesting that he is  a sufficient\n\n                               -8-\n\nthreat  to society  to  warrant additional  incarceration.   Such\n\ninformation,  however,  has no  tendency  to  make more  or  less\n\nprobable the existence of  the fact of a prior  conviction, which\n                                   \n\nis  the only information that  Congress has deemed of consequence\n\nconcerning the defendant's criminal record.  And  it is precisely\n\nthe   tendency  of   such  evidence   to  prejudice   the  jury's\n\ndeliberations that makes it suspect.\n\n     Moreover, the government's right  to introduce the nature of\n\na particularly prejudicial prior felony  would have to be matched\n\nby  the defendant's  right to introduce  evidence that  his prior\n\nconviction was for a technical, nonviolent or white collar crime.\n\nIn such a  case, the jury might tend  to minimize the defendant's\n\nculpability and  be less  inclined to  impose the severe  penalty\n\nassociated with a felon-in-possession  conviction.  This would be\n\nno  more appropriate  than  the reverse  tendency.   Either  way,\n\nCongressional  policy  would  be  subverted.   The  neutral  role\n\nintended to be played by the prior felony element  of   922(g)(1)\n\nwould be replaced by a two-tier system of guilt determination.\n\n     Additionally, because the nature  of the predicate felony is\n\nwholly  unrelated  to the  crime for  which  the defendant  is on\n\ntrial, excluding the extraneous information concerning its nature\n\nshould create no burden  for either the court or  the government.\n\nThe defendant's unadorned stipulation could  be read to the  jury\n\nor,  if   the  government  preferred,  a   redacted  judgment  of\n\nconviction  could  be introduced  into  evidence.   Severing  the\n\n                               -9-\n\nadmissible  evidence from  the  inadmissible  thus would  require\n\nneither sensitive nor difficult judgments.\n\n     We have focused here only on the kind of case represented at\n\nbar, where there  exists no reason,  other than the  government's\n\ndesire  to  color  the   jury's  perception  of  the  defendant's\n\ncharacter,  for revealing  the  nature of  the defendant's  prior\n\nfelony.    Although we  cannot now  conceive of  circumstances in\n\nwhich  the  probativeness  of  the facts  surrounding  the  prior\n\nconviction  would outweigh  the prejudice  to the  defendant from\n\nadmission  of  those  details,  there may  be  permutations  that\n\npresently escape our vision.  We therefore  do not announce a per\n\nse rule  of  exclusion.    Even in  such  unusual  circumstances,\n\nhowever,  evidence beyond  the fact  of the  prior  conviction is\n\ninadmissible  absent  adequate  trial  court  findings  that  its\n\nnoncumulative relevance is sufficiently compelling to survive the\n\nbalancing test of Fed. R. Evid. 403. (\"[E]vidence may be excluded\n\nif  its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice . . . .\").  \n\n     Our conclusion on this issue is supported by a  considerable\n\nnumber,  though not  all, of  the other  circuits.   The Eleventh\n\nCircuit applies  the same abuse  of discretion  standard that  we\n\nadopt today.  See United States v. O'Shea, 724 F.2d 1514, 1516-17\n                                         \n\n(11th Cir.  1984).  The D.C.

And the  Fifth and  Tenth Circuits  similarly have\n\nrecognized  the  district  court's  authority to  decide  on  the\n\nadmissibility of  prior crimes  evidence.   See United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nBrinklow,  560 F.2d 1003,  1006 (10th Cir.  1977) (case involving\n        \n\ninterstate  transportation of  explosives by a  convicted felon);\n\nUnited States v.

But see United States v.  Breitkreutz,\n                                                                \n\n8  F.3d 688,  692 (9th  Cir. 1993)  (rejecting stipulation  as an\n\nalternative  form  of  proof  and  noting  \"the  rule   that  the\n\nprosecution  has  a right  to refuse  a  stipulation\").4   On the\n\n                    \n\n4  In  concurring in  Breitkreutz,  Judge Norris  noted  that the\n                                 \nmajority's  assumption that the nature of  the past conviction is\nrelevant in a    922(g)  prosecution conflicted with  Barker.   8\n                                                            \nF.3d at 693.\n\n                               -11-\n\nother  side,   as  noted  earlier,  are  the   Sixth  and  Eighth\n\nCircuits.5  \n\n     We  want to be  crystal clear about what  we are not saying.\n\nFirst, we  are not saying  that the fact  of the prior  predicate\n                                        \n\nfelony  can be  kept  from the  jury.   Second,  the  prosecution\n\nordinarily cannot be forced to accept a stipulation if it prefers\n\nto introduce a  judgment of  conviction properly  redacted.   The\n\ntrial court would retain the discretion, however, to exclude this\n\ndocument  if the nature or  number of redactions  would invest it\n\nwith  prejudicial  overtones.    In   some  circumstances,  where\n\ndocumentary evidence is unavailable, properly  circumscribed oral\n\ntestimony would be permissible.  \n\n     Third, in  response to the government's  apprehension that a\n\ndefendant might, in closing argument or otherwise, insinuate that\n\nthe   prior   felony  conviction   was   benign,   we  note   the\n\ninappropriateness of  limiting our  options based upon  a concern\n\nthat  counsel irresponsibly  would contrive  to abuse  our chosen\n\nprocedure.  We add that any  such conduct would be subject to the\n\ntrial court's sanctioning power.  We have every confidence in the\n\ncourt's  ability to  convey  in neutral  fashion both  Congress's\n\ndetermination that  any prior felony provides  a sufficient basis\n\nfor  subsequent punishment  for possession  of firearms,  and the\n\n                    \n\n5 The decision of the Third Circuit in United States v. Williams,\n                                                                \n612  F.2d 735,  740 (3d  Cir. 1979),  also facially  supports the\ngovernment's position.  The  stipulation at issue there, however,\nconcerned  the  fact of  the prior  conviction, and  the decision\n                    \ntherefore  simply may  reflect agreement  with our  conclusion in\nCollamore  that  a   defendant  may  not  modify  a   statute  by\n         \neliminating one of its elements from the jury's consideration.\n\n                               -12-\n\njury's obligation to  accept that judgment  and not speculate  on\n\nthe nature of the earlier crime.\n\n     Fourth,  we  acknowledge   that  in   some  cases   evidence\n\nconcerning the nature  of the prior conviction will be admissible\n\nfor impeachment or other reasons,  despite its lack of  probative\n\nvalue on the prior conviction element of the crime.   See O'Shea,\n                                                                \n\n724 F.2d at 1516-17.\n\n     Finally, we reject the notion that the course we set here is\n\na  risky one,  setting  the stage  for  similar reasoning  to  be\n\napplied  in contexts  where greater  hazards might  lie.   In the\n\nfirst place, a stipulation to a defendant's  status as a felon is\n\neasily and  obviously distinguishable from those  relating to his\n\nactions or state of mind in committing the crime.   In the second\n\nplace,  the  evidence  we  exclude  has  no legitimate  claim  to\n\nrelevance.   In the third  place, the unnecessary  risk of unfair\n\nprejudice  looms as clear and  likely in this  context.  Finally,\n\nour  holding allows the  trial court to  recognize and articulate\n\nany special circumstances justifying admission of evidence of the\n\nnature of the predicate offense.\n\n     In  this  case, the  government  has  added the  claim  that\n\nadmitting  evidence of  the  nature of  the  predicate crime,  if\n\nerror, was harmless.   We  cannot agree.   The government's  case\n\nrested heavily on the testimony of two witnesses, Blake and Hunt,\n\nwho identified Tavares as  the gun-wielding assailant.  Tavares's\n\ndefense strategy  relied on challenging the  credibility of these\n\nwitnesses  and  suggesting  that  the  actual  perpetrators  were\n\n                               -13-\n\nconnected  to Blake's  drug dealing.   The fact  that defendant's\n\nprior conviction  involved the unlawful acquisition  of a firearm\n\ncould  not help  but  influence the  jurors' attitude  toward his\n\nclaim  that, this  time, someone  else had the  gun.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Torres,  610 F.  Supp. 1089, 1093  (E.D.N.Y. 1985)  (in\n                \n\nfelon-in-possession  case,  evidence  of  prior  convictions  for\n\nmanslaughter  with a gun and  illegal possession of  a gun \"would\n\nsurely prejudice almost any jury, no matter how conscientious\").\n\n     Adding to our conviction  that the error was harmful  is the\n\nfact that two close evidentiary points were resolved against  the\n\ndefendant, resulting  in  admission of  other  prejudicial  facts\n\nabout his criminal disposition.   Over defendant's objection, the\n\ncourt allowed testimony from  a witness who claimed to  have seen\n\ndefendant  steal the  car radio  and testimony  about defendant's\n\ndestructive behavior at the police station after his arrest.\n\n     Whether or  not this  evidence was properly  allowed,6 there\n\nis  little  doubt  that  the  inadmissible  testimony  concerning\n\nTavares's  prior felony added fuel to an already brewing fire and\n\nincreased  the   risk  that   the  jury  drew   upon  defendant's\n\ndisposition in reaching its verdict.   In these circumstances, we\n\ncannot say that \"it is `\"highly probable\"' that the error did not\n\n                    \n\n6 Both the eyewitness testimony explicitly identifying Tavares as\nthe  radio  thief  and  the testimony  about  defendant's  police\nstation behavior  create some risk of  injecting unfair prejudice\nfor  the  defendant  without  adding significant  weight  to  the\nprosecution's case.  If the government seeks to re-introduce this\nevidence in a  new trial, we  urge the district court  to \"remain\nvigilant\" as to whether  it survives the Rule 403  balancing, see\n                                                                 \nUnited States v.

I write  separately, not  because I\n     \n\nharbor reservations  about the result  reached in this  case, but\n\nbecause I  fear that the court's  opinion may be read  by some to\n\nrecalibrate the balance  that Fed. R. Evid. 403 demands.   I have\n\nthree qualms.\n\n     First:    I  think   that  the  court,  in   endeavoring  to\n     First:\n          \n\ndistinguish  between the fact of a prior conviction and the basic\n\nfacts  necessary to  give  that conviction  content, suggests  an\n\nuncomfortably cramped    and somewhat artificial    definition of\n\nrelevance.    In my  view, the  disputed  evidence is  relevant  \n\nalbeit perhaps marginally so   but nonetheless inadmissible under\n\na proper application of Rule 403.\n\n     Second:  I question the court's approach to Rule 403 in this\n     Second:\n           \n\nsituation.  The rule  does not state, nor should  it be construed\n\nto  mean, that prejudicial evidence may be admitted at trial only\n\nif  its  harmful  effect   is  substantially  outweighed  by  its\n\nrelevance.    Rather,  the   presumption  works  the  other  way,\n\nmandating  the admissibility  of  relevant evidence  unless  good\n\nreason  appears for its exclusion.   See United  States v. Foley,\n                                                                \n\n871  F.2d 235,  238 (1st  Cir. 1989).   The  court here  seems to\n\nreverse  this  presumption, see,  e.g.,  ante at  8,  10, thereby\n                                             \n\nputting the shoe on the wrong foot.\n\n     Third:  I  fervently believe  that the Rule  403 balance  is\n     Third:\n          \n\nbest  struck on  a case by  case basis,  and that,  in almost all\n\ninstances, the  strikers of  the balance should  be the  district\n\n                               -16-\n\ncourts as opposed to the court of appeals.  See, e.g., Freeman v.\n                                                              \n\nPackage Mach. Co.,  865 F.2d  1331, 1340 (1st  Cir. 1988)  (\"Only\n                 \n\nrarely    and in extraordinarily compelling  circumstances   will\n\nwe, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district\n\ncourt's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing  of\n\nprobative  value and  unfair  effect.\").   I  worry that  today's\n\nopinion undervalues  this discretion and that  the court's words,\n\nthough correct in the context of the case before us, may be taken\n\nby  some as  a command that  will prompt  the district  courts to\n\nmicro-manage trials and thereby dispense justice of a superficial\n\nvariety  (which  is to  say, dispense  injustice).   In  the last\n\nanalysis,  a trial is not  an exercise in  computer science, but,\n\nrather,  a   recreation  of   flesh-and-blood   events  for   the\n\nedification of the factfinder.   The law is not so fastidious  as\n\nto demand  that all taste  be squeezed from  a piece of  evidence\n\nbefore a jury  can chew on  it.  To  the contrary, although  \"[a]\n\ncontrolled environment for the reception of proof is essential, .\n\n. . an artificially sterile  environment is neither necessary nor\n\ndesirable.\"   Wagenmann  v. Adams,  829 F.2d  196, 217  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1987).\n\n     In sum,  while I  agree that this  is the rare  situation in\n\nwhich evidence, though relevant, is unfairly prejudicial and must\n\nbe excluded, and while I share many of Judge Coffin's sentiments,\n\nI think the district  courts would be well  advised to avoid  any\n\nattempt  to  extrapolate a  general rule  from the  court's case-\n\nspecific holding.\n\n                               -17-\n",

Sec. 922(g)(1).  The statute makes it a crime for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ... possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At trial, defendant offered to stipulate to the fact that he had such a prior conviction.  The prosecutor refused to accept the stipulation.  On the basis of our decisions in United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d 24 (1st Cir.1989), and United States v. Donlon, 909 F.2d 650 (1st Cir.1990), the court allowed the prosecutor to introduce, in addition to the fact of the prior conviction, evidence of its nature--larceny of a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A panel of this court, two members concluding that under Collamore and Donlon the district court did not err in allowing the government to reject the stipulation and one member concluding the contrary, unanimously agreed that \"the precise issue in our case was not the subject of a focused discussion in the prior decisions, that the issue is an important and recurring one, and that en banc consideration of the issue is appropriate.\"   The full court accordingly granted rehearing and entertained further briefing and argument.  We now conclude that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government to reject the offered stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth only the facts essential for understanding the basic issue that concerns us.  The government's evidence at trial indicated that the defendant was involved in three escalating confrontations, culminating with a shooting incident, on the night of August 28-29, 1991, at a Mashpee, Massachusetts apartment complex.  The first two confrontations involved acrimonious discussions in which Tavares was accused of stealing a car radio.  The government also alleged that Tavares was involved in a third incident, in which he accosted with a gun another acquaintance who had engaged in a discussion with him about the radio theft, and then fired at the outside of this individual's apartment building.  Damage was done to two automobiles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares was shortly thereafter seen running in a wooded area and arrested.  An officer assisted by a police tracking dog subsequently located a shotgun and rifle in nearby woods.  Forensic evidence showed that the shotgun had fired shells found near the damaged cars.  Tavares was convicted following a three-day trial.  As noted earlier, the prosecutor was allowed to introduce evidence that Tavares had been convicted of a prior crime, larceny of a firearm, and had received a two-year sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first task is to reexamine our two cases on which the district court relied, Collamore and Donlon, to determine whether they remain compelling authority.  As we have indicated, the district court determined that it was constrained under these cases to accord the government the absolute right to reject the defendant's proffered stipulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Donlon, our more recent opinion, we dealt at length with the defendant's claim that grand jury testimony had been unlawfully admitted at trial.  Then, as to a number of secondary issues, we briefly indicated their disposition and our reasoning.  On the issue of the government's right to introduce evidence of the nature of the predicate crime, we merely cited Collamore.   In Collamore, decided a year earlier, the question before us was whether the court could bifurcate a felon-in-possession trial by requiring the government to prove the possession element of the charge before presenting to the jury proof of the defendant's criminal record.  We held that a court may not do so and reversed.  We observed that barring the government from presenting any evidence of a prior felony in a felon-in-possession case effectively \"eliminated an essential element of the government's case,\" 868 F.2d at 27, and thus improperly deprived the government of a jury trial on the crime as charged, id. at 28.   In support of our conclusion, we added by way of dictum that \"even in the face of an offer to stipulate, the government may choose to present evidence on the one felony necessary to prove the crime charged,\" id. at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we stand by and reaffirm the proposition central in Collamore, that a defendant may not use a stipulation or any other procedural device, including bifurcation, to remove from his felon-in-possession prosecution the fact of his prior conviction, we now realize upon reconsideration that our dictum rested on a shaky foundation.  In Collamore, we relied on three cases, two from the Sixth Circuit, United States v. Blackburn, 592 F.2d 300, 301 (6th Cir.1979);  and United States v. Burkhart, 545 F.2d 14, 15 (6th Cir.1976);  and one from the Eighth Circuit, United States v. Bruton, 647 F.2d 818, 825 (8th Cir.1981), which in turn ultimately relied upon United States v. Brickey, 426 F.2d 680, 685-86 (8th Cir.1970).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The question in Brickey was whether, in proving the crime giving rise to the instant prosecution, the government may be forced to accept a stipulation (\"a naked admission\") in lieu of presenting a full picture of the events and mind sets in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant in Brickey had been indicted for mail fraud and sought to stipulate to the fact that he had diverted funds so as to exclude evidence about his personal use of the money.  The Brickey panel found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to require the government to accept the stipulation, and quoted the following passage from Parr v. United States, 255 F.2d 86, 88 (5th Cir.1958):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>\"It is a general rule that 'A party is not required to accept a judicial admission of his adversary, but may insist on proving the fact.'   31 C.J.S. Evidence Sec. 299, p. 1068.  The reason for the rule is to permit a party 'to present to the jury a picture of the events relied upon.  To substitute for such picture a naked admission might have the effect to rob the evidence of much of its fair and legitimate weight.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">426 F.2d at 686.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brickey, the sole underpinning of the cases on which we relied in Collamore, is critically different from the case before us.  While the stipulation there concerned facts directly relevant to the instant crime, the case before us involves a stipulation to facts establishing only the defendant's status.  This difference is so significant that we no longer deem Collamore 's dictum to be compelling in cases such as this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we now reconsider the issue fully, we begin our analysis by reiterating its limited scope.  A decision to honor a stipulation concerning the predicate crime in a felon-in-possession case in no way trenches upon the right of the prosecution to make a full presentation of the crime currently charged.  We fully concede the government's \"right to 'present to the jury a picture of the events relied upon,' \" United States v. Doherty, 675 F.Supp. 714, 717 (D.Mass.1987), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 867 F.2d 47 (1st Cir.1989), including proof of all elements of the crime for which the defendant has been brought to trial.  The prosecution ordinarily may not be forced to eliminate gruesome details of a killing, the quantity of drugs, or the degree of malevolence exhibited by the defendant through a defense-proffered stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This well-established right of the government to present its case as it sees fit is in no fashion weakened by requiring a stipulation to establish the defendant's status as a felon.  The status element is a discrete and independent component of the crime, a requirement reflecting a Congressional policy that possession of a firearm is categorically prohibited for those individuals who have been convicted of a wide assortment of crimes calling for a punishment of over a year's imprisonment.  A defendant falls within the category simply by virtue of past conviction for any crime ranging from possession of short lobsters, see 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3372, to the most aggravated murder.  The predicate crime is significant only to demonstrate status, and a full picture of that offense is--even if not prejudicial--beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a situation in which there is only one way to prove this status, e.g., by the full record conviction including the nature of the offense.  Other ways include a redacted record, testimony by a clerk, stipulation, a defendant's affidavit, or even, in the absence of controversy, judicial notice of the prior conviction.  None of these alternatives is tainted by the inclusion of the prejudicial information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that, beyond establishing status, the predicate crime serves to crystallize the culpability of the defendant as a serious offender.  It asserts that knowledge of the nature of the predicate crime in this way bears on the jury's ability to evaluate the defendant's guilt on the felon-in-possession charge, and thus is relevant to its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to see this connection.  Relevant evidence, we are told by Federal Rule of Evidence 401, \"means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   The fact concerning defendant's prior criminal record that Sec. 922(g)(1) explicitly makes \"of consequence\" is whether it includes a crime carrying a penalty of more than a year's imprisonment.  It does not embrace additional facts such as a particular kind of felony.  Congress required no gradation for seriousness, numerosity or recency, although such distinctions have in other contexts been given significance.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (penalizing use of firearm in connection with crime of violence or drug trafficking crime);  Sec. 924(e)(1) (increasing firearms possession penalty for defendant convicted of multiple violent felonies or \"serious\" drug offenses).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, we understand the government to claim relevance in revelation of a crime that is particularly egregious (murder), socially opprobrious (pornography), systemically dangerous (organized crime), or similar to the crime occasioning the present prosecution (possession of firearms).  It is, of course, highly likely that such evidence would influence the jury's perception of the defendant, suggesting that he is a sufficient threat to society to warrant additional incarceration.  Such information, however, has no tendency to make more or less probable the existence of the fact of a prior conviction, which is the only information that Congress has deemed of consequence concerning the defendant's criminal record.  And it is precisely the tendency of such evidence to prejudice the jury's deliberations that makes it suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the government's right to introduce the nature of a particularly prejudicial prior felony would have to be matched by the defendant's right to introduce evidence that his prior conviction was for a technical, nonviolent or white collar crime.  In such a case, the jury might tend to minimize the defendant's culpability and be less inclined to impose the severe penalty associated with a felon-in-possession conviction.  This would be no more appropriate than the reverse tendency.  Either way, Congressional policy would be subverted.  The neutral role intended to be played by the prior felony element of Sec. 922(g)(1) would be replaced by a two-tier system of guilt determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, because the nature of the predicate felony is wholly unrelated to the crime for which the defendant is on trial, excluding the extraneous information concerning its nature should create no burden for either the court or the government.  The defendant's unadorned stipulation could be read to the jury or, if the government preferred, a redacted judgment of conviction could be introduced into evidence.  Severing the admissible evidence from the inadmissible thus would require neither sensitive nor difficult judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have focused here only on the kind of case represented at bar, where there exists no reason, other than the government's desire to color the jury's perception of the defendant's character, for revealing the nature of the defendant's prior felony.  Although we cannot now conceive of circumstances in which the probativeness of the facts surrounding the prior conviction would outweigh the prejudice to the defendant from admission of those details, there may be permutations that presently escape our vision.  We therefore do not announce a per se rule of exclusion.  Even in such unusual circumstances, however, evidence beyond the fact of the prior conviction is inadmissible absent adequate trial court findings that its noncumulative relevance is sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403.  (\"[E]vidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion on this issue is supported by a considerable number, though not all, of the other circuits.  The Eleventh Circuit applies the same abuse of discretion standard that we adopt today.  See United States v. O'Shea, 724 F.2d 1514, 1516-17 (11th Cir.1984).  The D.C. Circuit also has held in a felon-in-possession case that \"the Government's right to introduce its proof is always subject to the trial court's responsibility under Fed.R.Evid. 403 to limit unduly prejudicial or cumulative evidence.\"   See United States v. Dockery, 955 F.2d 50, 54 (D.C.Cir.1992).  And the Fifth and Tenth Circuits similarly have recognized the district court's authority to decide on the admissibility of prior crimes evidence.  See United States v. Brinklow, 560 F.2d 1003, 1006 (10th Cir.1977) (case involving interstate transportation of explosives by a convicted felon);  United States v. Spletzer, 535 F.2d 950, 955-56 (5th Cir.1976) (case involving escape).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second and Fourth Circuits affirmatively reject admission of evidence concerning the nature of the prior crime, see United States v. Gilliam, 994 F.2d 97, 103 (2d Cir.1993);  United States v. Poore, 594 F.2d 39, 41-43 (4th Cir.1979), while panels in both the Ninth and Seventh Circuits have signalled that it is within a court's discretion to accept a defense stipulation to the fact of a prior felony conviction, see United States v. Barker, 1 F.3d 957, 959 n. 3 (9th Cir.1993) (underlying facts of prior conviction irrelevant);  United States v. Pirovolos, 844 F.2d 415, 420 (7th Cir.1988) (defense's proffered stipulation to prior felony sufficient).  But see United States v. Breitkreutz, 8 F.3d 688, 692 (9th Cir.1993) (rejecting stipulation as an alternative form of proof and noting \"the rule that the prosecution has a right to refuse a stipulation\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On the other side, as noted earlier, are the Sixth and Eighth Circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We want to be crystal clear about what we are not saying.  First, we are not saying that the fact of the prior predicate felony can be kept from the jury.  Second, the prosecution ordinarily cannot be forced to accept a stipulation if it prefers to introduce a judgment of conviction properly redacted.  The trial court would retain the discretion, however, to exclude this document if the nature or number of redactions would invest it with prejudicial overtones.  In some circumstances, where documentary evidence is unavailable, properly circumscribed oral testimony would be permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, in response to the government's apprehension that a defendant might, in closing argument or otherwise, insinuate that the prior felony conviction was benign, we note the inappropriateness of limiting our options based upon a concern that counsel irresponsibly would contrive to abuse our chosen procedure.  We add that any such conduct would be subject to the trial court's sanctioning power.  We have every confidence in the court's ability to convey in neutral fashion both Congress's determination that any prior felony provides a sufficient basis for subsequent punishment for possession of firearms, and the jury's obligation to accept that judgment and not speculate on the nature of the earlier crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, we acknowledge that in some cases evidence concerning the nature of the prior conviction will be admissible for impeachment or other reasons, despite its lack of probative value on the prior conviction element of the crime.  See O'Shea, 724 F.2d at 1516-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the notion that the course we set here is a risky one, setting the stage for similar reasoning to be applied in contexts where greater hazards might lie.  In the first place, a stipulation to a defendant's status as a felon is easily and obviously distinguishable from those relating to his actions or state of mind in committing the crime.  In the second place, the evidence we exclude has no legitimate claim to relevance.  In the third place, the unnecessary risk of unfair prejudice looms as clear and likely in this context.  Finally, our holding allows the trial court to recognize and articulate any special circumstances justifying admission of evidence of the nature of the predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government has added the claim that admitting evidence of the nature of the predicate crime, if error, was harmless.  We cannot agree.  The government's case rested heavily on the testimony of two witnesses, Blake and Hunt, who identified Tavares as the gun-wielding assailant.  Tavares's defense strategy relied on challenging the credibility of these witnesses and suggesting that the actual perpetrators were connected to Blake's drug dealing.  The fact that defendant's prior conviction involved the unlawful acquisition of a firearm could not help but influence the jurors' attitude toward his claim that, this time, someone else had the gun.  See United States v. Torres, 610 F.Supp. 1089, 1093 (E.D.N.Y.1985) (in felon-in-possession case, evidence of prior convictions for manslaughter with a gun and illegal possession of a gun \"would surely prejudice almost any jury, no matter how conscientious\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adding to our conviction that the error was harmful is the fact that two close evidentiary points were resolved against the defendant, resulting in admission of other prejudicial facts about his criminal disposition.  Over defendant's objection, the court allowed testimony from a witness who claimed to have seen defendant steal the car radio and testimony about defendant's destructive behavior at the police station after his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not this evidence was properly allowed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> there is little doubt that the inadmissible testimony concerning Tavares's prior felony added fuel to an already brewing fire and increased the risk that the jury drew upon defendant's disposition in reaching its verdict.  In these circumstances, we cannot say that \"it is ' \"highly probable\" ' that the error did not contribute to the verdict,\" United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1455 (1st Cir.1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of conviction is therefore VACATED, and the case remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concurrence follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge, with whom LEVIN H. CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, joins (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I write separately, not because I harbor reservations about the result reached in this case, but because I fear that the court's opinion may be read by some to recalibrate the balance that Fed.R.Evid. 403 demands.  I have three qualms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  I think that the court, in endeavoring to distinguish between the fact of a prior conviction and the basic facts necessary to give that conviction content, suggests an uncomfortably cramped--and somewhat artificial--definition of relevance.  In my view, the disputed evidence is relevant--albeit perhaps marginally so--but nonetheless inadmissible under a proper application of Rule 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  I question the court's approach to Rule 403 in this situation.  The rule does not state, nor should it be construed to mean, that prejudicial evidence may be admitted at trial only if its harmful effect is substantially outweighed by its relevance.  Rather, the presumption works the other way, mandating the admissibility of relevant evidence unless good reason appears for its exclusion.  See United States v. Foley, 871 F.2d 235, 238 (1st Cir.1989).  The court here seems to reverse this presumption, see, e.g., ante at 4, 5, thereby putting the shoe on the wrong foot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  I fervently believe that the Rule 403 balance is best struck on a case by case basis, and that, in almost all instances, the strikers of the balance should be the district courts as opposed to the court of appeals.  See, e.g., Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\").  I worry that today's opinion undervalues this discretion and that the court's words, though correct in the context of the case before us, may be taken by some as a command that will prompt the district courts to micro-manage trials and thereby dispense justice of a superficial variety (which is to say, dispense injustice).  In the last analysis, a trial is not an exercise in computer science, but, rather, a recreation of flesh-and-blood events for the edification of the factfinder.  The law is not so fastidious as to demand that all taste be squeezed from a piece of evidence before a jury can chew on it.  To the contrary, although \"[a] controlled environment for the reception of proof is essential, ... an artificially sterile environment is neither necessary nor desirable.\"  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 217 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while I agree that this is the rare situation in which evidence, though relevant, is unfairly prejudicial and must be excluded, and while I share many of Judge Coffin's sentiments, I think the district courts would be well advised to avoid any attempt to extrapolate a general rule from the court's case-specific holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the predicate crime may not be a felony, the common reference which we adopt is a \"felon-in-possession\" offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that the court endeavored to minimize any prejudice.

Williams, 612 F.2d 735, 740 (3d Cir.1979), also facially supports the government's position.  The stipulation at issue there, however, concerned the fact of the prior conviction, and the decision therefore simply may reflect agreement with our conclusion in Collamore that a defendant may not modify a statute by eliminating one of its elements from the jury's consideration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Both the eyewitness testimony explicitly identifying Tavares as the radio thief and the testimony about defendant's police station behavior create some risk of injecting unfair prejudice for the defendant without adding significant weight to the prosecution's case.  If the government seeks to re-introduce this evidence in a new trial, we urge the district court to \"remain vigilant\" as to whether it survives the Rule 403 balancing, see United States v.

Sec. 922(g)(1).  The statute makes it a crime for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ... possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At trial, defendant offered to stipulate to the fact that he had such a prior conviction.

We now conclude that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government to reject the offered stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth only the facts essential for understanding the basic issue that concerns us.  The government's evidence at trial indicated that the defendant was involved in three escalating confrontations, culminating with a shooting incident, on the night of August 28-29, 1991, at a Mashpee, Massachusetts apartment complex.  The first two confrontations involved acrimonious discussions in which Tavares was accused of stealing a car radio.  The government also alleged that Tavares was involved in a third incident, in which he accosted with a gun another acquaintance who had engaged in a discussion with him about the radio theft, and then fired at the outside of this individual's apartment building.  Damage was done to two automobiles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares was shortly thereafter seen running in a wooded area and arrested.  An officer assisted by a police tracking dog subsequently located a shotgun and rifle in nearby woods.  Forensic evidence showed that the shotgun had fired shells found near the damaged cars.  Tavares was convicted following a three-day trial.  As noted earlier, the prosecutor was allowed to introduce evidence that Tavares had been convicted of a prior crime, larceny of a firearm, and had received a two-year sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first task is to reexamine our two cases on which the district court relied, Collamore and Donlon, to determine whether they remain compelling authority.  As we have indicated, the district court determined that it was constrained under these cases to accord the government the absolute right to reject the defendant's proffered stipulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Donlon, our more recent opinion, we dealt at length with the defendant's claim that grand jury testimony had been unlawfully admitted at trial.  Then, as to a number of secondary issues, we briefly indicated their disposition and our reasoning.  On the issue of the government's right to introduce evidence of the nature of the predicate crime, we merely cited Collamore.   In Collamore, decided a year earlier, the question before us was whether the court could bifurcate a felon-in-possession trial by requiring the government to prove the possession element of the charge before presenting to the jury proof of the defendant's criminal record.  We held that a court may not do so and reversed.  We observed that barring the government from presenting any evidence of a prior felony in a felon-in-possession case effectively \"eliminated an essential element of the government's case,\" 868 F.2d at 27, and thus improperly deprived the government of a jury trial on the crime as charged, id. at 28.   In support of our conclusion, we added by way of dictum that \"even in the face of an offer to stipulate, the government may choose to present evidence on the one felony necessary to prove the crime charged,\" id. at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we stand by and reaffirm the proposition central in Collamore, that a defendant may not use a stipulation or any other procedural device, including bifurcation, to remove from his felon-in-possession prosecution the fact of his prior conviction, we now realize upon reconsideration that our dictum rested on a shaky foundation.

A decision to honor a stipulation concerning the predicate crime in a felon-in-possession case in no way trenches upon the right of the prosecution to make a full presentation of the crime currently charged.  We fully concede the government's \"right to 'present to the jury a picture of the events relied upon,' \" United States v. Doherty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1637965\"><a href=\"/opinion/1637965/united-states-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The prosecution ordinarily may not be forced to eliminate gruesome details of a killing, the quantity of drugs, or the degree of malevolence exhibited by the defendant through a defense-proffered stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This well-established right of the government to present its case as it sees fit is in no fashion weakened by requiring a stipulation to establish the defendant's status as a felon.  The status element is a discrete and independent component of the crime, a requirement reflecting a Congressional policy that possession of a firearm is categorically prohibited for those individuals who have been convicted of a wide assortment of crimes calling for a punishment of over a year's imprisonment.  A defendant falls within the category simply by virtue of past conviction for any crime ranging from possession of short lobsters, see 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3372, to the most aggravated murder.  The predicate crime is significant only to demonstrate status, and a full picture of that offense is--even if not prejudicial--beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a situation in which there is only one way to prove this status, e.g., by the full record conviction including the nature of the offense.  Other ways include a redacted record, testimony by a clerk, stipulation, a defendant's affidavit, or even, in the absence of controversy, judicial notice of the prior conviction.  None of these alternatives is tainted by the inclusion of the prejudicial information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that, beyond establishing status, the predicate crime serves to crystallize the culpability of the defendant as a serious offender.  It asserts that knowledge of the nature of the predicate crime in this way bears on the jury's ability to evaluate the defendant's guilt on the felon-in-possession charge, and thus is relevant to its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to see this connection.  Relevant evidence, we are told by Federal Rule of Evidence 401, \"means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   The fact concerning defendant's prior criminal record that Sec. 922(g)(1) explicitly makes \"of consequence\" is whether it includes a crime carrying a penalty of more than a year's imprisonment.  It does not embrace additional facts such as a particular kind of felony.  Congress required no gradation for seriousness, numerosity or recency, although such distinctions have in other contexts been given significance.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (penalizing use of firearm in connection with crime of violence or drug trafficking crime);  Sec. 924(e)(1) (increasing firearms possession penalty for defendant convicted of multiple violent felonies or \"serious\" drug offenses).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, we understand the government to claim relevance in revelation of a crime that is particularly egregious (murder), socially opprobrious (pornography), systemically dangerous (organized crime), or similar to the crime occasioning the present prosecution (possession of firearms).  It is, of course, highly likely that such evidence would influence the jury's perception of the defendant, suggesting that he is a sufficient threat to society to warrant additional incarceration.  Such information, however, has no tendency to make more or less probable the existence of the fact of a prior conviction, which is the only information that Congress has deemed of consequence concerning the defendant's criminal record.  And it is precisely the tendency of such evidence to prejudice the jury's deliberations that makes it suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the government's right to introduce the nature of a particularly prejudicial prior felony would have to be matched by the defendant's right to introduce evidence that his prior conviction was for a technical, nonviolent or white collar crime.  In such a case, the jury might tend to minimize the defendant's culpability and be less inclined to impose the severe penalty associated with a felon-in-possession conviction.  This would be no more appropriate than the reverse tendency.  Either way, Congressional policy would be subverted.  The neutral role intended to be played by the prior felony element of Sec. 922(g)(1) would be replaced by a two-tier system of guilt determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, because the nature of the predicate felony is wholly unrelated to the crime for which the defendant is on trial, excluding the extraneous information concerning its nature should create no burden for either the court or the government.  The defendant's unadorned stipulation could be read to the jury or, if the government preferred, a redacted judgment of conviction could be introduced into evidence.  Severing the admissible evidence from the inadmissible thus would require neither sensitive nor difficult judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have focused here only on the kind of case represented at bar, where there exists no reason, other than the government's desire to color the jury's perception of the defendant's character, for revealing the nature of the defendant's prior felony.  Although we cannot now conceive of circumstances in which the probativeness of the facts surrounding the prior conviction would outweigh the prejudice to the defendant from admission of those details, there may be permutations that presently escape our vision.  We therefore do not announce a per se rule of exclusion.  Even in such unusual circumstances, however, evidence beyond the fact of the prior conviction is inadmissible absent adequate trial court findings that its noncumulative relevance is sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403.  (\"[E]vidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion on this issue is supported by a considerable number, though not all, of the other circuits.  The Eleventh Circuit applies the same abuse of discretion standard that we adopt today.  See United States v. O'Shea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429660\"><a href=\"/opinion/429660/united-states-v-john-patrick-oshea/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1514</span></a></span>, 1516-17 (11th Cir.1984).  The D.C. Circuit also has held in a felon-in-possession case that \"the Government's right to introduce its proof is always subject to the trial court's responsibility under Fed.R.Evid. 403 to limit unduly prejudicial or cumulative evidence.\"   See United States v. Dockery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577000\"><a href=\"/opinion/577000/united-states-v-johnny-dockery-aka-lynden-dockery-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (D.C.Cir.1992).  And the Fifth and Tenth Circuits similarly have recognized the district court's authority to decide on the admissibility of prior crimes evidence.  See United States v. Brinklow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348464\"><a href=\"/opinion/348464/united-states-v-jerry-f-brinklow/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1006 (10th Cir.1977) (case involving interstate transportation of explosives by a convicted felon);  United States v.

Barker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627464\"><a href=\"/opinion/627464/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-alvin-barker/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 959 n. 3 (9th Cir.1993) (underlying facts of prior conviction irrelevant);  United States v.

But see United States v. Breitkreutz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656186\"><a href=\"/opinion/656186/united-states-v-douglas-paul-breitkreutz/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 692 (9th Cir.1993) (rejecting stipulation as an alternative form of proof and noting \"the rule that the prosecution has a right to refuse a stipulation\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On the other side, as noted earlier, are the Sixth and Eighth Circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We want to be crystal clear about what we are not saying.  First, we are not saying that the fact of the prior predicate felony can be kept from the jury.  Second, the prosecution ordinarily cannot be forced to accept a stipulation if it prefers to introduce a judgment of conviction properly redacted.  The trial court would retain the discretion, however, to exclude this document if the nature or number of redactions would invest it with prejudicial overtones.  In some circumstances, where documentary evidence is unavailable, properly circumscribed oral testimony would be permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, in response to the government's apprehension that a defendant might, in closing argument or otherwise, insinuate that the prior felony conviction was benign, we note the inappropriateness of limiting our options based upon a concern that counsel irresponsibly would contrive to abuse our chosen procedure.  We add that any such conduct would be subject to the trial court's sanctioning power.  We have every confidence in the court's ability to convey in neutral fashion both Congress's determination that any prior felony provides a sufficient basis for subsequent punishment for possession of firearms, and the jury's obligation to accept that judgment and not speculate on the nature of the earlier crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, we acknowledge that in some cases evidence concerning the nature of the prior conviction will be admissible for impeachment or other reasons, despite its lack of probative value on the prior conviction element of the crime.  See O'Shea, 724 F.2d at 1516-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the notion that the course we set here is a risky one, setting the stage for similar reasoning to be applied in contexts where greater hazards might lie.  In the first place, a stipulation to a defendant's status as a felon is easily and obviously distinguishable from those relating to his actions or state of mind in committing the crime.  In the second place, the evidence we exclude has no legitimate claim to relevance.  In the third place, the unnecessary risk of unfair prejudice looms as clear and likely in this context.  Finally, our holding allows the trial court to recognize and articulate any special circumstances justifying admission of evidence of the nature of the predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government has added the claim that admitting evidence of the nature of the predicate crime, if error, was harmless.  We cannot agree.  The government's case rested heavily on the testimony of two witnesses, Blake and Hunt, who identified Tavares as the gun-wielding assailant.  Tavares's defense strategy relied on challenging the credibility of these witnesses and suggesting that the actual perpetrators were connected to Blake's drug dealing.  The fact that defendant's prior conviction involved the unlawful acquisition of a firearm could not help but influence the jurors' attitude toward his claim that, this time, someone else had the gun.  See United States v. Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1469237\"><a href=\"/opinion/1469237/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1093 (E.D.N.Y.1985) (in felon-in-possession case, evidence of prior convictions for manslaughter with a gun and illegal possession of a gun \"would surely prejudice almost any jury, no matter how conscientious\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adding to our conviction that the error was harmful is the fact that two close evidentiary points were resolved against the defendant, resulting in admission of other prejudicial facts about his criminal disposition.

I have three qualms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  I think that the court, in endeavoring to distinguish between the fact of a prior conviction and the basic facts necessary to give that conviction content, suggests an uncomfortably cramped--and somewhat artificial--definition of relevance.  In my view, the disputed evidence is relevant--albeit perhaps marginally so--but nonetheless inadmissible under a proper application of Rule 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  I question the court's approach to Rule 403 in this situation.  The rule does not state, nor should it be construed to mean, that prejudicial evidence may be admitted at trial only if its harmful effect is substantially outweighed by its relevance.  Rather, the presumption works the other way, mandating the admissibility of relevant evidence unless good reason appears for its exclusion.  See United States v. Foley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520583\"><a href=\"/opinion/520583/united-states-v-richard-e-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 238 (1st Cir.1989).  The court here seems to reverse this presumption, see, e.g., ante at 4, 5, thereby putting the shoe on the wrong foot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  I fervently believe that the Rule 403 balance is best struck on a case by case basis, and that, in almost all instances, the strikers of the balance should be the district courts as opposed to the court of appeals.  See, e.g., Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\").  I worry that today's opinion undervalues this discretion and that the court's words, though correct in the context of the case before us, may be taken by some as a command that will prompt the district courts to micro-manage trials and thereby dispense justice of a superficial variety (which is to say, dispense injustice).  In the last analysis, a trial is not an exercise in computer science, but, rather, a recreation of flesh-and-blood events for the edification of the factfinder.  The law is not so fastidious as to demand that all taste be squeezed from a piece of evidence before a jury can chew on it.  To the contrary, although \"[a] controlled environment for the reception of proof is essential, ... an artificially sterile environment is neither necessary nor desirable.\"  Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 217 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while I agree that this is the rare situation in which evidence, though relevant, is unfairly prejudicial and must be excluded, and while I share many of Judge Coffin's sentiments, I think the district courts would be well advised to avoid any attempt to extrapolate a general rule from the court's case-specific holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the predicate crime may not be a felony, the common reference which we adopt is a \"felon-in-possession\" offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that the court endeavored to minimize any prejudice.
