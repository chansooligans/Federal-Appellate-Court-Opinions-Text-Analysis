Appellant  Jorge  Hernando  Hoyos-Medina\n                     \n\nappeals the denial of  his 28 U.S.C.    2255 petition to  reverse\n\nhis  conviction.  He claims ineffective  assistance of counsel in\n\nviolation   of  the   sixth  amendment   of  the   United  States\n\nConstitution.  For  the reasons  stated below, we  find that  the\n\ndistrict court properly denied the petition.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Appellant  was convicted  of  violations  of 21  U.S.C.\n\n   952(a), 841(a)(1), 955 for possession and importation into the\n\nUnited  States,  of 10.4  kilograms  of cocaine.    Appellant was\n\narrested  while  traveling  from  Bogot ,  Colombia   to  Geneva,\n\nSwitzerland on Iberia Airlines.   The plane stopped in  San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico and  was searched by United States Customs officials.\n\nThe  inspectors  isolated  what  was alleged  to  be  appellant's\n\nsuitcase  because it was heavy and had irregular stitching on the\n\noutside  that  suggested the  bag had  a  secret compartment.   A\n\nsearch of its contents revealed a stash of cocaine.  The suitcase\n\nbore  a  baggage claim  ticket; a  plastic  name tag,  written in\n\nappellant's handwriting and  identifying the bag  as his; and  an\n\nIberia  Airlines control number.  The control number is placed on\n\nthe baggage, the airline ticket, and the boarding pass, to insure\n\nthat  the passenger who checked-in  a particular piece of luggage\n\nboards  the aircraft.    Every  bag  must  be  accompanied  by  a\n\npassenger  or  it  is removed  from  the  plane  before take-off.\n\nBecause the control number  is an antiterrorist safeguard,  it is\n\nattached without  the passenger's knowledge.   Appellant's ticket\n\nand boarding pass corresponded to  the control number attached to\n\nthe  suspect  luggage.    Customs  officials  arrested  appellant\n\nprimarily on the basis of this matching control number.\n\n          Appellant maintains that he was traveling to Madrid and\n\nGeneva for pleasure, and to purchase dental equipment for the son\n\nof a friend.  While appellant admitted writing the identification\n\ntag, he  denies ownership  of the  suspect  suitcase.   Appellant\n\nclaims that when he  approached the Iberia counter in  the Bogot \n\nairport, he  was asked  by the  female attendant  to fill  out an\n\nidentification tag for his carry-on bag and to pay the  exit tax.\n\nHe  contends  that he  left his  bag  and the  identification tag\n\nunattended at the counter to  get exact change to pay the  tax at\n\nthe direction of the Iberia check-in official.  When he returned,\n\nthe female attendant had been replaced by another individual, who\n\ninstructed appellant  to  hurry to  the gate  since boarding  had\n\nbegun.   Appellant argues that  during the mix-up,  while his bag\n\nwas  out  of   his  sight,   an  employee  must   have  put   the\n\nidentification tag he filled out on someone else's baggage.\n\n          After a  jury convicted appellant,  his court-appointed\n\ntrial  counsel moved  to withdraw  from the  case.   The district\n\ncourt granted the motion, appointed  a federal public defender to\n\nrepresent  appellant  at   sentencing,  and  sentenced  appellant\n\naccording to the guidelines.  \n\n          In United States v. Hoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d 21 (1st Cir.\n                                          \n\n1989), we  affirmed the conviction but allowed appellant to raise\n\nthe  ineffective  assistance of  counsel  claim  in a  collateral\n\nproceeding, since it  was not  properly before the  court at  the\n\n                               -3-\n\ntime  of the  first appeal.   Appellant  unsuccessfully presented\n\nthis  ineffective assistance  of  counsel claim  in the  district\n\ncourt.  We now turn to the merits of his claim.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          In Strickland  v. Washington, 466 U.S.  668 (1984), the\n                                      \n\nSupreme  Court  established  a  two-prong  test  for  ineffective\n\nassistance  of   counsel  claims.    The   first  prong  requires\n\npetitioners  to demonstrate  that \"counsel's  representation fell\n\nbelow  an objective standard of reasonableness.\"  Id. at 688; see\n                                                                 \n\nalso L pez-Nieves v. United  States, 917 F.2d 645, 648  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990).  This aspect of the test  presents a formidable hurdle, as\n\nthe  court begins  with the  presumption that  \"counsel's conduct\n\nfalls within the wide rage of reasonable professional assistance;\n\nthat is, the defendant must overcome the  presumption that, under\n\nthe  circumstances, the  challenged action  'might be  considered\n\nsound  trial strategy.'\"   Id.  at 669  (citation omitted).   The\n                              \n\nsecond  prong   demands  a   showing  that  defendant   has  been\n\nprejudiced.   More specifically, defendant must  show that \"there\n\nis   a   reasonable   probability   that,   but   for   counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors,  the result  of the proceeding  would have\n\nbeen different.\"   Id. at 694; see also L pez-Nieves, 917 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n648.\n\n          Appellant alleges  several errors on the  part of trial\n\ncounsel.   He contends that counsel improperly (1) failed to seek\n\na continuance to secure  witnesses and documents that  would have\n\nbolstered  appellant's version  of  the facts;  (2) attempted  to\n\n                               -4-\n\ncoerce  appellant  into  pleading  guilty;  and  (3)  acted  with\n\narrogance towards  appellant and  indifference towards  his case.\n\nWe begin  by  analyzing  the  specific pieces  of  evidence  that\n\nappellant claims trial counsel negligently failed  to investigate\n\nand introduce into evidence.  \n\n          First,  appellant  maintains  that, had  trial  counsel\n\nsought a continuance, he would have  presented testimony from his\n\nwife and friends regarding his good character.  We note, however,\n\nthat counsel reasonably may have  decided not to call appellant's\n\nwife.   The  two were  separated at  the time  of the  trial, and\n\ncross-examination  of   the   wife  might   have  ventured   into\n\ncompromising matters for defendant.   Therefore, the decision not\n\nto call her was  within \"sound trial strategy.\"   Strickland, 466\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 669.  \n\n          With  respect to  other character  witnesses, we  admit\n\nthat if appellant wished to have  such witnesses testify, counsel\n\nshould have  called them.   At the   2255  hearing, trial counsel\n\noffered no  explanation for failing to  call character witnesses.\n\nBut, assuming arguendo that such omission constitutes objectively\n                      \n\nunreasonable professional  conduct, we cannot say  that 'but for'\n\nthe  failure to  offer  testimony of  good  character, the  trial\n\nprobably would have  turned out  differently.   Id. at  694.   In\n                                                   \n\nlight  of the strong  evidence linking appellant  to the luggage,\n\nthe omission of character witnesses was not prejudicial. \n\n          Second, appellant  claims that he would  have offered a\n\nletter  from  an  official   at  Iberia  Airlines,  stating  that\n\n                               -5-\n\nappellant checked one piece of luggage weighing 21 kilograms  for\n\nwhich he did not have to pay an overweight charge.  Putting aside\n\nthe  question of admissibility,1 such a letter would be of little\n\nassistance to appellant unless the disputed bag weighed in excess\n\nof 21  kilos.  Since the record shows no evidence with respect to\n\nthe weight  of the suitcase  seized by the  government, counsel's\n\nfailure   to   introduce   the  document   was   not  objectively\n\nunreasonable.  It is unhelpful to argue that trial counsel should\n\nhave attempted to get evidence that the disputed suitcase weighed\n\nmore than defendant's luggage.   To grant such an  argument would\n\nrequire that  we reverse  a conviction  based on  the defendant's\n\nunsupported allegation  of the possible  existence of exculpatory\n\nevidence.  In the context of a   2255 collateral attack, in order\n\nto  succeed, appellant  must be  able to  point to  some concrete\n\nevidence that the trial counsel should have presented.  \n\n          The defect  in appellant's line of  argument is readily\n\napparent.    At the  hearing on  this  appeal, counsel  said that\n\nappellant  was not given the opportunity to show that his version\n\nof  the story  was true.   He maintained  that he  filled out the\n\nidentification  tag in  front  of a  female  check-in clerk;  was\n\nseparated from his  bags at  her direction; and  returned to  the\n\ncounter,  only  to  be hustled  off  to  the  gate.   He  further\n\nmaintained  that  during  his  absence  the  identification  tag,\n\n                    \n\n1  The district court opined that much of appellant's documentary\nevidence would have been  inadmissible without foundation or live\ntestimony.   Hoyos-Medina v. United States, No. 92-1373, slip op.\n                                          \nat 4 n.3, 5 n.4 (D.P.R. July 22, 1992).\n\n                               -6-\n\nwritten in his hand-writing, had been attached to someone  else's\n\nsuitcase  filled with cocaine.   When asked by  the court whether\n\ncounsel  could  produce  a  witness  to  corroborate  appellant's\n\nversion, or whether the record showed whether such a witness ever\n\nexisted,  counsel replied  only  that trial  counsel should  have\n\nfound  one.  Such a bald  assertion cannot support a reversal for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel because we  do not know whether\n\nthere was a witness that trial counsel unprofessionally failed to\n\ndiscover.\n\n          Third, appellant claims that counsel failed to obtain a\n\nletter  or  testimony  from  the  son  of a  friend  (who  is  an\n\northodontist) corroborating appellant's story that the purpose of\n\nthe trip was, in  part, to purchase dental equipment on the son's\n\nbehalf.   While  corroboration of  this purpose  would have  been\n\nhelpful  to him,  appellant testified  as to  the purpose  of his\n\ntrip.  But,  like the  failure to bring  character witnesses,  we\n\ncannot  say that 'but for'  the failure to  solicit and introduce\n\nthe letter, there is a  reasonable probability -- one \"sufficient\n\nto undermine confidence in the outcome\" -- that the verdict would\n\nhave been different.  Id. at 694.  Thus, appellant failed to make\n                         \n\nthe required showing of prejudice.  \n\n          The overall object of  the inquiry at this stage  is to\n\nensure  that  some significant  piece  of  evidence (which  would\n\nsupport  appellant's claim  of  innocence) was  not entered  into\n\nevidence because  of trial  counsel's unprofessional errors.   At\n\nthis  late  date appellant  has failed  to  show any  evidence to\n\n                               -7-\n\nundermine  the  critical piece  of  evidence linking  him  to the\n\nsuspect  baggage:  the control number 145 which connected the bag\n\nwith Hoyos-Medina's ticket and boarding pass.\n\n          We  now  turn  to  appellant's  allegations that  trial\n\ncounsel attempted to coerce  a guilty plea, and that  counsel was\n\nindifferent towards the case.   Trial counsel purportedly visited\n\nHoyos-Medina at  the penitentiary  and falsely informed  him that\n\nthe judge was \"rip roaring mad\" at him.  In addition, he promised\n\nthat the judge would be lenient if appellant pled guilty and told\n\nhim  to  \"go to  hell\"  when appellant  protested  his innocence.\n\nEvidence  of  counsel's  indifference  includes:  (1) failure  to\n\nvigorously  argue a Rule 29  Motion for Judgment  of Acquittal at\n\nthe close of the government's case; and (2) voluntary suppression\n\nof  a  document  from   the  Colombian  Government  attesting  to\n\nappellant's clean criminal record.\n\n          At  the    2255  hearing, trial  counsel admitted  that\n\n\"often  times one  has to  prod [defendants]  for the  purpose of\n\nhelping them  help themselves, so to speak.\"  He also stated that\n\nhe told Hoyos-Medina  that \"if the jury does not  believe you and\n\nif the judge believes that  you have lied, the judge is  going to\n\nscrew you.\"\n\n          To  begin with,  we do  not condone  any  pressure from\n\ndefense counsel to plead  guilty.  Defendant's choice of  plea is\n\nentirely   his  own.     Our   criminal  justice   system  exerts\n\nconsiderable pressure  to  induce guilty  pleas without  improper\n\ninfluence from court-appointed attorneys charged with the duty to\n\n                               -8-\n\ndefend accused.\n\n          Nonetheless, it is unnecessary to delve too deeply into\n\nappellant's final allegations of ineffective assistance.  Because\n\ntrial  counsel  was  unsuccessful  in  his  attempt  to  pressure\n\nappellant to  plead  guilty, the  purported  coercion is  but  an\n\nexample of  counsel's alleged  negative  or indifferent  attitude\n\ntowards his case.   We  find these claims  without merit  because\n\noutward indicia of trial  counsel's effort suggests the contrary.\n\nHe  filed the  appropriate motions  in a  timely manner  and kept\n\nabreast  of  appellant's  case.     For  example,  trial  counsel\n\nsucceeded  in excluding  a damaging  document that  appellant now\n\nargues  should have been admitted.  Indeed, the document from the\n\nColombian government regarding appellant's criminal history would\n\nhave  shown no convictions, but it also would have indicated that\n\nhe  had been tried and  acquitted of extortion.   This seems like\n\nsound  trial  strategy to  us.   Appellant's vague  assertions of\n\nineffectiveness  and indifference  do not  constitute objectively\n\nreasonable  professional misconduct, nor  do they demonstrate the\n\nnecessary  prejudice.    In  this  case,  we  do  not  find  that\n\nineffective representation caused a break-down of the adversarial\n\nprocess such that defendant did not receive a fair trial.\n\n          Finally, we  need not  consider appellant's  request to\n\nremand the  case to the district court for a ruling on the merits\n\nof his  Motion Requesting Amendments and Further Findings of Fact\n\nto the Judgment,  submitted pursuant  to Fed. R.  Civ. P.  52(b),\n\nbecause  the motion  offers substantially  the same  arguments as\n\n                               -9-\n\nappellant's  brief  on appeal.    We have  amply  canvassed these\n\narguments.\n\n          The district court's decision is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -10-\n",

The suitcase\n\nbore  a  baggage claim  ticket; a  plastic  name tag,  written in\n\nappellant's handwriting and  identifying the bag  as his; and  an\n\nIberia  Airlines control number.  The control number is placed on\n\nthe baggage, the airline ticket, and the boarding pass, to insure\n\nthat  the passenger who checked-in  a particular piece of luggage\n\nboards  the aircraft.    Every  bag  must  be  accompanied  by  a\n\npassenger  or  it  is removed  from  the  plane  before take-off.\n\nBecause the control number  is an antiterrorist safeguard,  it is\n\nattached without  the passenger's knowledge.   Appellant's ticket\n\nand boarding pass corresponded to  the control number attached to\n\nthe  suspect  luggage.    Customs  officials  arrested  appellant\n\nprimarily on the basis of this matching control number.\n\n          Appellant maintains that he was traveling to Madrid and\n\nGeneva for pleasure, and to purchase dental equipment for the son\n\nof a friend.  While appellant admitted writing the identification\n\ntag, he  denies ownership  of the  suspect  suitcase.   Appellant\n\nclaims that when he  approached the Iberia counter in  the Bogot \n\nairport, he  was asked  by the  female attendant  to fill  out an\n\nidentification tag for his carry-on bag and to pay the  exit tax.\n\nHe  contends  that he  left his  bag  and the  identification tag\n\nunattended at the counter to  get exact change to pay the  tax at\n\nthe direction of the Iberia check-in official.  When he returned,\n\nthe female attendant had been replaced by another individual, who\n\ninstructed appellant  to  hurry to  the gate  since boarding  had\n\nbegun.   Appellant argues that  during the mix-up,  while his bag\n\nwas  out  of   his  sight,   an  employee  must   have  put   the\n\nidentification tag he filled out on someone else's baggage.\n\n          After a  jury convicted appellant,  his court-appointed\n\ntrial  counsel moved  to withdraw  from the  case.   The district\n\ncourt granted the motion, appointed  a federal public defender to\n\nrepresent  appellant  at   sentencing,  and  sentenced  appellant\n\naccording to the guidelines.  \n\n          In United States v.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), the\n                                      \n\nSupreme  Court  established  a  two-prong  test  for  ineffective\n\nassistance  of   counsel  claims.    The   first  prong  requires\n\npetitioners  to demonstrate  that \"counsel's  representation fell\n\nbelow  an objective standard of reasonableness.\"  Id. at 688; see\n                                                                 \n\nalso L pez-Nieves v. United  States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550641\"><a href=\"/opinion/550641/jose-valentin-lopez-nieves-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990).  This aspect of the test  presents a formidable hurdle, as\n\nthe  court begins  with the  presumption that  \"counsel's conduct\n\nfalls within the wide rage of reasonable professional assistance;\n\nthat is, the defendant must overcome the  presumption that, under\n\nthe  circumstances, the  challenged action  'might be  considered\n\nsound  trial strategy.'\"   Id.  at 669  (citation omitted).   The\n                              \n\nsecond  prong   demands  a   showing  that  defendant   has  been\n\nprejudiced.   More specifically, defendant must  show that \"there\n\nis   a   reasonable   probability   that,   but   for   counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors,  the result  of the proceeding  would have\n\nbeen different.\"   Id. at 694; see also L pez-Nieves, 917 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n648.\n\n          Appellant alleges  several errors on the  part of trial\n\ncounsel.   He contends that counsel improperly (1) failed to seek\n\na continuance to secure  witnesses and documents that  would have\n\nbolstered  appellant's version  of  the facts;  (2) attempted  to\n\n                               -4-\n\ncoerce  appellant  into  pleading  guilty;  and  (3)  acted  with\n\narrogance towards  appellant and  indifference towards  his case.\n\nWe begin  by  analyzing  the  specific pieces  of  evidence  that\n\nappellant claims trial counsel negligently failed  to investigate\n\nand introduce into evidence.  \n\n          First,  appellant  maintains  that, had  trial  counsel\n\nsought a continuance, he would have  presented testimony from his\n\nwife and friends regarding his good character.  We note, however,\n\nthat counsel reasonably may have  decided not to call appellant's\n\nwife.   The  two were  separated at  the time  of the  trial, and\n\ncross-examination  of   the   wife  might   have  ventured   into\n\ncompromising matters for defendant.   Therefore, the decision not\n\nto call her was  within \"sound trial strategy.\"   Strickland, 466\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 669.  \n\n          With  respect to  other character  witnesses, we  admit\n\nthat if appellant wished to have  such witnesses testify, counsel\n\nshould have  called them.   At the   2255  hearing, trial counsel\n\noffered no  explanation for failing to  call character witnesses.\n\nBut, assuming arguendo that such omission constitutes objectively\n                      \n\nunreasonable professional  conduct, we cannot say  that 'but for'\n\nthe  failure to  offer  testimony of  good  character, the  trial\n\nprobably would have  turned out  differently.   Id. at  694.   In\n                                                   \n\nlight  of the strong  evidence linking appellant  to the luggage,\n\nthe omission of character witnesses was not prejudicial. \n\n          Second, appellant  claims that he would  have offered a\n\nletter  from  an  official   at  Iberia  Airlines,  stating  that\n\n                               -5-\n\nappellant checked one piece of luggage weighing 21 kilograms  for\n\nwhich he did not have to pay an overweight charge.  Putting aside\n\nthe  question of admissibility,1 such a letter would be of little\n\nassistance to appellant unless the disputed bag weighed in excess\n\nof 21  kilos.  Since the record shows no evidence with respect to\n\nthe weight  of the suitcase  seized by the  government, counsel's\n\nfailure   to   introduce   the  document   was   not  objectively\n\nunreasonable.  It is unhelpful to argue that trial counsel should\n\nhave attempted to get evidence that the disputed suitcase weighed\n\nmore than defendant's luggage.   To grant such an  argument would\n\nrequire that  we reverse  a conviction  based on  the defendant's\n\nunsupported allegation  of the possible  existence of exculpatory\n\nevidence.  In the context of a   2255 collateral attack, in order\n\nto  succeed, appellant  must be  able to  point to  some concrete\n\nevidence that the trial counsel should have presented.  \n\n          The defect  in appellant's line of  argument is readily\n\napparent.    At the  hearing on  this  appeal, counsel  said that\n\nappellant  was not given the opportunity to show that his version\n\nof  the story  was true.   He maintained  that he  filled out the\n\nidentification  tag in  front  of a  female  check-in clerk;  was\n\nseparated from his  bags at  her direction; and  returned to  the\n\ncounter,  only  to  be hustled  off  to  the  gate.   He  further\n\nmaintained  that  during  his  absence  the  identification  tag,\n\n                    \n\n1  The district court opined that much of appellant's documentary\nevidence would have been  inadmissible without foundation or live\ntestimony.   Hoyos-Medina v. United States, No. 92-1373, slip op.\n                                          \nat 4 n.3, 5 n.4 (D.P.R. July 22, 1992).\n\n                               -6-\n\nwritten in his hand-writing, had been attached to someone  else's\n\nsuitcase  filled with cocaine.   When asked by  the court whether\n\ncounsel  could  produce  a  witness  to  corroborate  appellant's\n\nversion, or whether the record showed whether such a witness ever\n\nexisted,  counsel replied  only  that trial  counsel should  have\n\nfound  one.  Such a bald  assertion cannot support a reversal for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel because we  do not know whether\n\nthere was a witness that trial counsel unprofessionally failed to\n\ndiscover.\n\n          Third, appellant claims that counsel failed to obtain a\n\nletter  or  testimony  from  the  son  of a  friend  (who  is  an\n\northodontist) corroborating appellant's story that the purpose of\n\nthe trip was, in  part, to purchase dental equipment on the son's\n\nbehalf.   While  corroboration of  this purpose  would have  been\n\nhelpful  to him,  appellant testified  as to  the purpose  of his\n\ntrip.  But,  like the  failure to bring  character witnesses,  we\n\ncannot  say that 'but for'  the failure to  solicit and introduce\n\nthe letter, there is a  reasonable probability -- one \"sufficient\n\nto undermine confidence in the outcome\" -- that the verdict would\n\nhave been different.  Id. at 694.  Thus, appellant failed to make\n                         \n\nthe required showing of prejudice.  \n\n          The overall object of  the inquiry at this stage  is to\n\nensure  that  some significant  piece  of  evidence (which  would\n\nsupport  appellant's claim  of  innocence) was  not entered  into\n\nevidence because  of trial  counsel's unprofessional errors.   At\n\nthis  late  date appellant  has failed  to  show any  evidence to\n\n                               -7-\n\nundermine  the  critical piece  of  evidence linking  him  to the\n\nsuspect  baggage:  the control number 145 which connected the bag\n\nwith Hoyos-Medina's ticket and boarding pass.\n\n          We  now  turn  to  appellant's  allegations that  trial\n\ncounsel attempted to coerce  a guilty plea, and that  counsel was\n\nindifferent towards the case.   Trial counsel purportedly visited\n\nHoyos-Medina at  the penitentiary  and falsely informed  him that\n\nthe judge was \"rip roaring mad\" at him.  In addition, he promised\n\nthat the judge would be lenient if appellant pled guilty and told\n\nhim  to  \"go to  hell\"  when appellant  protested  his innocence.\n\nEvidence  of  counsel's  indifference  includes:  (1) failure  to\n\nvigorously  argue a Rule 29  Motion for Judgment  of Acquittal at\n\nthe close of the government's case; and (2) voluntary suppression\n\nof  a  document  from   the  Colombian  Government  attesting  to\n\nappellant's clean criminal record.\n\n          At  the    2255  hearing, trial  counsel admitted  that\n\n\"often  times one  has to  prod [defendants]  for the  purpose of\n\nhelping them  help themselves, so to speak.\"  He also stated that\n\nhe told Hoyos-Medina  that \"if the jury does not  believe you and\n\nif the judge believes that  you have lied, the judge is  going to\n\nscrew you.\"\n\n          To  begin with,  we do  not condone  any  pressure from\n\ndefense counsel to plead  guilty.  Defendant's choice of  plea is\n\nentirely   his  own.     Our   criminal  justice   system  exerts\n\nconsiderable pressure  to  induce guilty  pleas without  improper\n\ninfluence from court-appointed attorneys charged with the duty to\n\n                               -8-\n\ndefend accused.\n\n          Nonetheless, it is unnecessary to delve too deeply into\n\nappellant's final allegations of ineffective assistance.  Because\n\ntrial  counsel  was  unsuccessful  in  his  attempt  to  pressure\n\nappellant to  plead  guilty, the  purported  coercion is  but  an\n\nexample of  counsel's alleged  negative  or indifferent  attitude\n\ntowards his case.   We  find these claims  without merit  because\n\noutward indicia of trial  counsel's effort suggests the contrary.\n\nHe  filed the  appropriate motions  in a  timely manner  and kept\n\nabreast  of  appellant's  case.     For  example,  trial  counsel\n\nsucceeded  in excluding  a damaging  document that  appellant now\n\nargues  should have been admitted.  Indeed, the document from the\n\nColombian government regarding appellant's criminal history would\n\nhave  shown no convictions, but it also would have indicated that\n\nhe  had been tried and  acquitted of extortion.   This seems like\n\nsound  trial  strategy to  us.   Appellant's vague  assertions of\n\nineffectiveness  and indifference  do not  constitute objectively\n\nreasonable  professional misconduct, nor  do they demonstrate the\n\nnecessary  prejudice.    In  this  case,  we  do  not  find  that\n\nineffective representation caused a break-down of the adversarial\n\nprocess such that defendant did not receive a fair trial.\n\n          Finally, we  need not  consider appellant's  request to\n\nremand the  case to the district court for a ruling on the merits\n\nof his  Motion Requesting Amendments and Further Findings of Fact\n\nto the Judgment,  submitted pursuant  to Fed. R.  Civ. P.  52(b),\n\nbecause  the motion  offers substantially  the same  arguments as\n\n                               -9-\n\nappellant's  brief  on appeal.    We have  amply  canvassed these\n\narguments.\n\n          The district court's decision is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -10-\n</pre>",
