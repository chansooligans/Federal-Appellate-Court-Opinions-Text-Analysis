Povich, Assistant  United States  Attorney,  with whom  A.\n                                                                 \nJohn Pappalardo, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n          \n\n                                        \n\n                      January 18, 1994\n                                        \n\n         ALDRICH,  Senior  Circuit  Judge.    Defendant  was\n                                         \n\nindicted in two counts:  Count One, \"On or about February 26,\n\n1991,  at Boston  . . . defendant  herein  did knowingly  and\n\nintentionally possess with intent to distribute . . . cocaine\n\n. . .  in violation of Title 21,  United States Code, Section\n\n841(a)(1).\"   Count Two, \"On  or about February 26,  1991, at\n\nBoston . . . defendant herein did knowingly and intentionally\n\nuse  a firearm  . . .  during  and in  relation  to the  drug\n\ntrafficking crime  alleged in  Count One  of this  Indictment\n\n. . . in violation  of Title 18, United States  Code, Section\n\n924(c).\"  A  jury found him guilty on both counts.  The court\n\nsentenced him to 21 months on Count One, including points for\n\npossession of  a firearm  under Sentencing  Guidelines.1   It\n\nordered an acquittal on Count  Two.  From this the government\n\nappeals.   Defendant  appeals in  other respects.    The only\n\nerror we find is the acquittal.  We start there.\n\n         Section  924(c) provides,  \"Whoever  during and  in\n\nrelation to any crime  of violence or drug  trafficking crime\n\n. . .  uses or carries  a firearm\" shall  receive a mandatory\n\nsentence  of  five years,  to  be  served  on and  after  the\n\nsentence for  the principal  offense.   The seriousness  with\n\nwhich Congress viewed this conduct  is emphasized by the fact\n\n                   \n\n1.  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1) calls for a two level enhancement,\n\"[i]f   a  dangerous   weapon  (including   a   firearm)  was\npossessed.\"   This is  an alternative  to a  conviction under\n 924(c).  U.S.S.G.   2K2.4 (commentary).\n\n                            -3-\n\nthat it  denied parole at  a time when parole  was ordinarily\n\navailable  as  a matter  of  course.    If this  may  suggest\n\napprehension of violence (see also    924(c)(2) and (3)), the\n                                 \n\nCourt has  not so  restricted the statute.   Smith  v. United\n                                                            \n\nStates,  113  S.Ct.  2050  (1993)  (gun  bartered  for  drugs\n     \n\nconstitutes \"use\" in relation to drug trafficking).\n\n         Before  discussing the  statute further,  we review\n\nthe  facts in  the light,  of course,  most favorable  to the\n\ngovernment.  United States v.  McNatt, 813 F.2d 499, 502 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1987).   Defendant, an  18 year  old student,  dealt in\n\n\"twenties,\" $20 single packs of  crack cocaine.2  On February\n\n26, 1991, two undercover officers, armed with a warrant, rang\n\nthe downstairs doorbell  to his apartment, and  asked for two\n\ntwenties.  Defendant  brought down two from his  room and the\n\ntransaction, concededly, all took place  in the foyer.  As an\n\nofficer  sought  thereafter  to  seize   him,  declaring  his\n\nidentity, defendant  fled upstairs,  locking his  door.   The\n\nofficers broke  down the door  and conducted a search.   This\n\nrevealed their marked money under his mattress, together with\n\nan unloaded  shotgun.   Under the bed,  in a  container, were\n\nmore money and packs.   Was this use of the  gun \"in relation\n\nto the crime\"?\n\n                   \n\n2.  At sentencing it appeared that the government had weighed\nseven of eighteen packs and that they totalled .83 gram.\n\n                            -4-\n\n         That the gun was unloaded, and no ammunition found,\n\ncould be evidence in defendant'sfavor, but unloaded guns can \n\nbe used aggressively.  McLaughlin v. United States, 476  U.S.\n                                                 \n\n16,  17-18 (1986)  (unloaded gun  is  \"dangerous weapon\"  for\n\npurposes of 18 U.S.C.   2113(d)).   Nor would use be rebutted\n\nby  lack of ownership.  See  United States v. Wight, 968 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1393  (1st  Cir.  1992).   The  jury,  further,  could reject\n\ndefendant's  claim  that  the gun  belonged  to  his sister's\n\nformer boyfriend, and  that he was merely hiding  it from his\n\nnephews.     While  mere  possession  is  not  a  crime,  the\n\ngovernment properly asked the jury, why did he keep it?\n\n         We  agree with defendant that the word \"uses\" calls\n\nfor something  more than \"possesses.\"   We may  further agree\n\nthat in defendant's transaction with the officers he  did not\n\nuse the gun,  and had no intent  to.  The difficulty  is that\n\nthe  drug  trafficking   crime,  as  defined  in   21  U.S.C.\n\n 841(a)(1),  with which he  was charged was  possession with\n\nintent,  not the  sale.  We  have held that  mere presence of\n\narms for  the protection  of drugs for  sale is  present use.\n\nUnited States v.  Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22 (1st  Cir.) (guns in\n                          \n\nduffel  bag  with cocaine),  cert.  denied, 111  S.  Ct. 2813\n                                         \n\n(1991); United  States v.  Hadfield, 918  F.2d 987  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1990) (guns on  the drug premises), cert. denied,  111 S. Ct.\n                                               \n\n2062  (1991).   Wilkinson's  taking  guns with  the  drugs to\n\nsomeone else's house would seem  active use.  And it is  true\n\n                            -5-\n\nthat defendant Hadfield publicly advertised that he had guns,\n\nclearly a present use  as a deterrent.  However, we based our\n\nopinion  broadly,  on  simple  presence  for protection,  the\n\nmaintenance of a \"fortress.\"\n\n         It could be said that mere maintenance of  a secret\n\nfortress is  not a  present use, but  is an  intent regarding\n\npossible future use.   However, we did not,  and the majority\n\nof the  circuits do not,  draw that distinction.   See United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v.

But  see  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nRobinson, 997  F.2d 884 (D.C.  Cir. 1993);  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nDerr, 990 F.2d 1330 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\n   \n\n         There is, of  course, a difference between  a large\n\nquantity  of cocaine  with a  \"fortress\" of  guns, and  a $20\n\ndealer with two grams of cocaine and an unloaded shotgun, but\n\nit is a difference in degree, not in kind.  It can not be for\n\nthe court  to control the  U.S. Attorney's use of  this truly\n\nfortress of  a statute; a  defendant's only hope is  the U.S.\n\nAttorney's judgment, and the jury.  Here he failed.\n\n         Alternatively,  defendant seeks  a new  trial.   We\n\nhave examined  his several  contentions with  care, but  they\n\nrequire little  comment.   Defendant's complaints  as to  the\n\ncharge, and to the weight of the evidence, are in accord with\n\nhis  claims on  the acquittal,  and must  fail equally.   The\n\ncourt's adjustments  and failure  to adjust  the sentence  on\n\nCount One were, routinely, within its discretion.\n\n         A word  as to the  dissent.  We share  in approving\n\nthe flexibility of  the Sentencing Guidelines, but  we see no\n\ngive, and no surrender, in this monolith of a statute, on the\n\nbooks for many  years and not  disturbed when the  Guidelines\n\nwere enacted.  Moreover, how does one measure  for this?  And\n\n                            -7-\n\nin what way do our differing facts, on a case by  case basis,\n\nindicate that we are  taking a new approach?   Only one  gun?\n\nPossible  lack  of   title?    No   ammunition?3    Lack   of\n\nexhibiting?   No  instant access?   Under  our cases  none of\n\nthese failures  is fatal.   The reason  for this is  that the\n\ndifference between mere possession and  use is in the mind of\n\nthe user.   United States v.  Payero, 888 F.2d  928, 929 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1989)  (possession lending  courage is  use); Wilkinson,\n                                                           \n\n926  F.2d  at  25 (\"emboldening,\"  quoting  United  States v.\n                                                         \n\nStewart, 779 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir. 1985)); United States v.\n                                                         \n\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983  (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied\n                                                            \n\nsub  nom Sarraff  v.

Even without defendant's admission,\n\n\"It's good  protection for anyone in the neighborhood to have\n\na  gun in  their house  also because  people get  robbed,\" we\n\ncannot think that $360 in drugs  plus $510 in cash, would not\n\nwarrant a jury's finding  that defendant's thinking  included\n\n                   \n\n3.  While  other circuits have  held that lack  of ammunition\ndoes  not prevent conviction  in a \"drug  trafficking crime,\"\ne.g., United States v. Martinez, 912 F.2d 419, 421 (10th Cir.\n                              \n1990), cited with  approval in United States  v.

We\nsee no distinction.\n\n                            -8-\n\nthe gun.   The statute does not measure  the crime.  In light\n\nof  the accounts  we read  daily of  mayhem over  trifles, we\n\nadopt  what we  said  in  Wilkinson,  (and  remembering  what\n                                  \n\nWilkinson itself said was \"help\"), \"[U]ltimately, whether  or\n        \n\nnot the  gun[ ] helped appellant  commit the drug crime  is a\n\nmatter  for a jury,  applying common-sense theories  of human\n\nnature and  causation.\"  926 F.2d at 26.   This is not to say\n\nthat it need  \"automatically\" find it.

The  narrow\n                              \n\nlegal question before  this panel is not  whether possession\n                                                 \n\nof  a gun (\"in relation to the [drug] crime\") means a longer\n\nsentence for  a convicted drug  dealer.   It most  certainly\n\ndoes.  Nor is the question whether the \"possession\" here was\n\n\"in  relation to\"  the  drug  crime, ante  at  4.   It  was.\n                                         \n\nRather,  the  question  concerns  which  sentencing  statute\n                                                            \n\ngoverns the precise length of the  extra term of punishment,\n\na blunt \"mandatory  minimum\" gun \"use\" statute, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c) (mandatory five-year sentence), or the somewhat  more\n\nsophisticated  sentencing  guideline statutes,  under  which\n\nextra punishment for drug-related gun possession varies with\n\nthe  seriousness of the drug crime.   U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1)\n\n(2-level sentence enhancement).                 The   answer\n\nto this  question turns on the  meaning of a single  word in\n\nthe \"mandatory  minimum\" statute, the word \"use.\"  Does that\n\nword \"use\" include  simple \"possession\" of a  gun \"connected\n         \n\nwith\"  a drug crime?   If so,  the majority is  right, for I\n\nhave  no  doubt  that  the  jury  here  could  find  both  a\n\n\"possession\"  and some  kind of  \"relation\" or  \"connection\"\n\nbetween gun and  crime.  But, in  my view, prior cases,  and\n\nlikely congressional intent,  indicate that the word  \"use,\"\n\nin this particular statute, carries a more active meaning --\n\nameaning thatexcludes simple(drug-crime-related) possession.\n\n                            -10-\n\n          Let me be  more specific.  The  special \"mandatory\n\nminimum\"  sentencing statute says  that anyone who  \"uses or\n                                                            \n\ncarries\" a gun  \"during and in  relation to any  . . .  drug\n       \n\ntrafficking crime\" must receive a mandatory five-year prison\n\nterm  added on  to his  drug crime  sentence.   18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c).   At  the  same  time,  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,\n\npromulgated under the  authority of a different  statute, 28\n\nU.S.C.   994, provide for a  two-level (i.e., a 30% to  40%)\n\nsentence enhancement where a  \"firearm . . .  was possessed\"\n\nby  a  drug  offender, U.S.S.G.     2D1.1(b)(1),  unless the\n\npossession  clearly  was  not  \"connected  with  the  [drug]\n\noffense.\"   Id. app.  n.3.   The  Guideline enhancement  for\n               \n\ndrug-crime-related gun possession  may amount  to less  than\n\nfive  additional years,  as  it would  here.   The  specific\n\nquestion  before us  is  whether, for  sentencing  purposes,\n\ncourts should try to distinguish between a gun's drug-crime-\n\nrelated  \"use\"  and   its  drug-crime-related  \"possession,\"\n\nparticularly when  the predicate  drug crime  is \"possession\n\nwith intent to distribute.\"\n\n          Courts  might   have  simplified  the   matter  by\n\nanswering this question  in the negative.   They might  have\n\nreasoned  that, at least in drug possession cases, virtually\n                                           \n\nany possession of a gun  amounts to \"use\" within the meaning\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nof   924(c).  Arguably, any gun that is both possessed  by a\n                           \n\ndrug offender,  and present at  or near the  site of a  drug\n\npossession  crime, helps  the offender  carry  out the  drug\n\ncrime.  It might do this by \"emboldening\" him, or perhaps by\n\nbeing available, should  the need arise, to  frighten others\n\nor to  protect the  drugs possessed.   Cf. United  States v.\n                                                         \n\nStewart, 779  F.2d 538, 540  (9th Cir. 1985).   Until today,\n       \n\nhowever,  courts  have  not taken  this  approach.    On the\n                           \n\ncontrary,  they have  insisted on maintaining  a significant\n\ndistinction  between \"possession\" and \"use\" of a gun by drug\n\noffenders in  the context  of prosecutions  under    924(c).\n\nUnited States v.  Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d  976, 983 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1992), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 2935  (1993); United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Payero, 888 F.2d 928,  929 (1st Cir. 1989); United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Robinson,  997 F.2d  884, 887  (D.C. Cir. 1993)  (statute\n           \n\n\"conspicuously fails to criminalize mere possession\").  \n\n          Traditional  tools  of   statutory  interpretation\n\nsupport the  near-universal judicial effort to  maintain the\n\ndistinction between  (drug-related) \"use\"  and \"possession.\"\n\nFirst,   the  ordinary  meanings  of  the  words  \"use\"  and\n\n\"carry\" -- the language in the \"mandatory minimum\" statute -\n\n- connote activity  beyond simple possession.   Cf. Smith v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 113 S. Ct.  2050, 2054 (1993) (the term \"use\"\n             \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nis  to  be  given  its  \"ordinary  or  natural  meaning\"  in\n\nconstruing   924(c)).  Second, Congress wrote those words in\n\nthe context of gun crime statutes that often use the broader\n\nword  \"possess\"  to   describe  the  prohibited  gun-related\n\nconduct.   See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.   922(g), (q)(1)(A).  As the\n                    \n\nsomewhat  hackneyed  judicial aphorism  goes,  when Congress\n\nwants to criminalize gun possession,  it knows how to do so.\n\nThird, a House Report  accompanying the 1986 amendment to   \n\n924(c)  (which extended the statute to drug crimes) provides\n\nsome indication  of Congress's expectation about the meaning\n\nof  the  word  \"use.\"    In the  course  of  discussing  the\n\n\"carrying\"  part of  the  statute,  the  Report  offers  the\n\nexample of a  drug trafficker who \"carrie[s]\"  a weapon \"for\n\nprotection  against rival traffickers.\"  Such a person quite\n\nclearly  \"possesses\"  the  weapon with  the  intent  to make\n\nactive use of it if necessary; yet, the Report adds, \"he did\n\nnot  actually use  the weapon.\"    H.R. Rep.  No. 495,  99th\n                 \n\nCong.,  2d Sess. 10  (1986), reprinted in  1986 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n                                         \n\n1327, 1336.\n\n          Most importantly,  courts  normally  try  to  read\n\nlanguage in different, but related, statutes, so as best  to\n\nreconcile those statutes, in light  of their purposes and of\n\ncommon  sense.  In this instance,  one relevant statute, the\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nstatute creating the Sentencing Guidelines, reflects a major\n\ncongressional  effort  to  create  a  fairly   sophisticated\n\nSentencing  Guidelines   system  that   distinguishes  among\n\ndifferent   kinds   of   criminal  behavior   and   punishes\n\naccordingly.    The  other statute,  the  mandatory  minimum\n\nstatute,  represents  an  ad hoc  deviation  from  that more\n\ngeneral policy.  Given the  importance (to Congress) of  the\n\nGuidelines  system, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n361,   363-370  (1989),  courts  should  take  care  not  to\n\ninterpret other  statutes that  represent ad hoc  deviations\n\nfrom   the   basic    congressionally-directed   effort   to\n\nrationalize sentencing with unnecessary breadth.  Yet, here,\n                                       \n\nto interpret the word \"use\"  to encompass \"possession\" is to\n\nswallow  up a guideline  that distinguishes,  for punishment\n\npurposes,  among different  kinds  of drug-  and gun-related\n\ncriminal  behavior.    Moreover,  it is  to  swallow  up the\n\nguideline  unnecessarily, for  neither the  language  of the\n                        \n\nmandatory  minimum  statute  nor its  purpose  (the  need to\n\npunish drug offenders with guns) requires that it do so.\n\n          I confess  that it  is easier to  see the  need to\n\ndistinguish  (drug-crime-related)  \"use\"  from  \"possession\"\n\nthan it is  to explain  just how to  make the distinction.  \n\nCourts  might  have  interpreted  \"use\"  by  insisting  upon\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nactivity with the gun, such  as firing it or brandishing it,\n        \n\nor, at least,  displaying it (or even trading  it for drugs,\n\nsee Smith,  supra).  But they  have not done this.   Rather,\n                 \n\nthey have  held that  the word  \"use\" sometimes  encompasses\n\nmore passive  activity, such as \"possession,\"  but sometimes\n\nit  does  not.    Thus,   we  must  try  to  articulate  the\n\ndistinguishing line they have drawn.\n\n          As I read the case law, when courts have held that\n\n\"use\" encompasses \"possession,\"  they have always  found (1)\n\npossession, (2)  in connection  with a drug  crime, and  (3)\n\nsomething more.  See United  States v. Wilson, 884 F.2d 174,\n                                             \n\n177  (5th  Cir.  1989)  (except  in  \"drug  fortress\"  cases\n\ninvolving  large amounts of drugs and money, \"something more\n\nthan  strategic proximity of drugs and firearms is necessary\n\nto honor Congress'  concerns.\").  And,  they have tended  to\n\ndescribe this \"something more\" as possession of the guns for\n                                                            \n\nprotection of the drugs,  thereby \"facilitat[ing]\" the  drug\n          \n\ncrime.  See, e.g., United  States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22,\n                                              \n\n26  (1st  Cir.)

If,\n\nfor example,  courts simply said  that possession  of a  gun\n\nwhen  drugs are  around means  a  fortiori that  the gun  is\n                                          \n\npresent \"for protection\" of the drugs, the mandatory minimum\n\nstatute's  word  \"use\"  would (once  again)  swallow  up the\n\nGuideline and  eradicate the  distinction between  \"use\" and\n\n\"possession\"  that courts  have tried  to  maintain.   It is\n\ntherefore   not   surprising  that   the  courts   have  not\n                                                            \n\ninterpreted or  applied this  language broadly.   They  have\n\navoided  the   \"swallowing  up\"  result   by  applying   the\n\n\"possession for protection\" concept only where circumstances\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\ndemonstrate  that  a  drug offender,  possessing  a  gun (in\n\nconnection  with the  crime), would  likely put  the gun  to\n                                           \n\nactive use  (such as firing  or brandishing it, or  at least\n\ndisplaying it in  an effort to intimidate) were  the need to\n                                                            \n\narise.   In determining whether  this later,  active use  is\n     \n\nlikely (i.e., in separating a theoretical possibility from a\n\nreal risk), courts have looked  at such factors as the gun's\n\naccessibility, whether  it is  loaded, the  amount of  drugs\n\npossessed, the presence  of other  guns, and  the extent  to\n\nwhich  dangerous transactions likely take place nearby, as a\n\nway of deciding whether the \"circumstances of the case show\"\n\nthat the gun  was present for protection.

Ct. 350  (1992); see,  e.g., Robinson,  997 F.2d  at 887\n                                         \n\n(listing factors);  United States  v.

Cir. 1993).\n\n          Examined in light of the case law's possession/use\n\ndistinction, the record  before us indicates that  this drug\n\noffender's \"possession\" of  the gun, even if related  to the\n\ndrug  crime, does  not rise to  the level  of a \"use.\"   The\n\ndefendant here was  a small-time drug dealer,  selling drugs\n\nin  $20 packages.   The  police found  a shotgun,  unloaded,\n\nwrapped in  a cloth bag,  hidden between his  bed's mattress\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nand its box spring (but next to $40 the police had paid him,\n\nand above a  strongbox on the floor containing  two grams of\n\ncocaine and  $510 cash).  They found  no ammunition anywhere\n\nin  the   apartment.    The  defendant   testified,  without\n\ncontradiction and  consistently with  an earlier  government\n\naffidavit, that the  gun belonged to someone else.   The gun\n\nwas   not  visible,   so  its   mere   presence  could   not\n\nautomatically  have frightened  a buyer  or  intruder.   The\n\ndefendant did not  brandish, display, touch, or  mention the\n\ngun  during the transaction  with police, nor  was there any\n\nevidence  that  he had  ever  done  so  during the  time  he\n\npossessed  drugs.    To  make  active  use  of  the  gun  in\n\nprotecting his drugs or intimidating a buyer or intruder, he\n\nwould  have had  to lift  the mattress,  seize the  gun, and\n\nunwrap it.  To fire the gun, the defendant would have had to\n\nfind  ammunition, bring it  to the  apartment, and  load the\n\ngun.   The  small  amount  of  cocaine  possessed  makes  it\n\nsomewhat less likely  that, in fact, he had  (or would have)\n\ndone  either.  In context, the defendant's \"admission,\" ante\n                                                            \n\nat 8, does not seem particularly relevant.  \n\n          Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility that\n\nany gun that is present, the way this gun was present, might\n\nbe put to active \"use.\"  But that is so virtually whenever a\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\ngun is present  near the scene of  a drug crime.   To find a\n\n\"possession  for protection\"  (i.e., a  \"use\")  here is,  in\n\neffect, to find that possession of  a gun (when related to a\n\ndrug crime) automatically means a  \"use.\"  It thereby erases\n                         \n\nthe line  that the statutes,  and the courts, have  tried to\n\ndraw, and again  allows the \"use\" statute to  swallow up the\n\n\"possession\" Guideline.\n\n          A  brief review  of  these cases  indicates rather\n\nstrong support for the  distinction I am drawing.   Consider\n\ncases in which courts have permitted a jury to infer that  a\n\ndefendant \"used\" nearby guns to  \"protect\" a stash of drugs.\n\nThey  involve  drug-related  risks  of  actually  firing  or\n\nbrandishing (or \"carry[ing]\") the gun that are significantly\n\ngreater  than the  risks  present here.   In  this circuit's\n\nHadfield  case, for  example,  the  inference  --  that  the\n        \n\ndefendant \"used\"  the  guns to  \"protect\" the  drugs --  was\n\nneither uncertain nor theoretical:  it was inescapable.  The\n\ndefendants ran a  massive drug  operation from  a barn  that\n\ncontained hundred of marijuana  plants, thousands of dollars\n\nin  cash, and  several  guns,  at least  two  of which  were\n\nloaded, standing on a nearby gun rack or hanging on the barn\n\nwalls.  A sign  near the barn said,  \"This house guarded  by\n\nshotgun three nights per week.  You guess which three.\"  918\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nF.2d at 991.  A clearer case of using guns for protection is\n\nhard to imagine.  \n\n          Our Wilkinson case,  although closer, presented  a\n                       \n\nsomewhat  different legal  question.   There, the  defendant\n\n\"carr[ied]\" with him  to a friend's house a  duffel bag that\n\ncontained two loaded  guns (wrapped in a towel)  and a cache\n\nof  drugs (although the  Wilkinson opinion is  silent on the\n                                  \n\npoint, the record indicates that the guns were loaded).  The\n\nproximity of loaded guns to the drugs  and the fact that the\n\ndefendant was  carrying them  together from  place to  place\n\npermitted the jury to infer that the defendant \"intended the\n\nguns for  protection,\" and  thus  that he  carried them  \"in\n\nrelation  to\"  his  drug  crime.

(Since\n                                      \n\nWilkinson  involved  the  statutory  terms  \"carry\" and  \"in\n         \n\nrelation  to,\"  strictly  speaking  it  did  not  raise  the\n\n\"use/possession\" problem here discussed.)\n\n          Similarly, other  cases allowing  an inference  of\n\npresence \"for protection\" have  involved close proximity and\n\nloaded  guns, or large drug operations, or multiple weapons,\n                                                   \n\nor easy accessibility, or some factor suggesting more than a\n                              \n\ntheoretical  possibility  that  the guns  might  be  used to\n\nprotect the drugs if necessary.

Id. at  1432 &amp; n.45.  In United  States v. Derr,\n                                                           \n\n990 F.2d 1330  (D.C.

The\n\ntheoretical  possibility of active use was always present in\n\nthese cases,  but the  courts  considered it  too remote  to\n\nallow a  jury to find,  beyond a reasonable doubt,  that the\n\ngun was present \"for protection.\"\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\n          Of course, one might simply argue that these cases\n\nare not all consistent with each other.  However, whether or\n\nnot that is so  seems to me beside the point.   The division\n\nin  the case law indicates a  perceived need to draw a legal\n\nline  between simple  possession of a  gun and its  use.  In\n\norder to  draw that line, one  must say that at  some point,\n\nthe risk that a defendant  will actually fire or brandish or\n\ndisplay a nearby  gun \"to protect\" a drug  stash becomes too\n\nsmall to permit the jury to infer an intent to protect.  Our\n\nprevious cases  lie on one side of that  line.  If we are to\n\nmaintain the  legal distinction  that courts  have tried  to\n\ndraw  (and if  we are to  avoid collapsing  the \"possession\"\n\nGuideline into  the mandatory  five-year term  of the  \"use\"\n\nstatute), this case, as the district court held, must lie on\n\nthe other.\n\n          For  these reasons, I would affirm the decision of\n\nthe district court.\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n",

The court sentenced him to 21 months on Count One, including points for possession of a firearm under Sentencing Guidelines.<sup>1</sup>  It ordered an acquittal on Count Two.

The seriousness with which Congress viewed this conduct is emphasized by the fact that it denied parole at a time when parole was ordinarily available as a matter of course.  If this may suggest apprehension of violence (see also Secs. 924(c)(2) and (3)), the Court has not so restricted the statute.  Smith v.

United States v. McNatt, 813 F.2d 499, 502 (1st Cir.1987). Defendant, an 18 year old student, dealt in \"twenties,\" $20 single packs of crack cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On February 26, 1991, two undercover officers, armed with a warrant, rang the downstairs doorbell to his apartment, and asked for two twenties.  Defendant brought down two from his room and the transaction, concededly, all took place in the foyer.  As an officer sought thereafter to seize him, declaring his identity, defendant fled upstairs, locking his door.  The officers broke down the door and conducted a search.  This revealed their marked money under his mattress, together with an unloaded shotgun.  Under the bed, in a container, were more money and packs.  Was this use of the gun \"in relation to the crime\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the gun was unloaded, and no ammunition found, could be evidence in defendant's favor, but unloaded guns can be used aggressively.  McLaughlin v. United States, 476 U.S. 16, 17-18, 106 S.Ct. 1677, 1678, 90 L.Ed.2d 15 (1986) (unloaded gun is \"dangerous weapon\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(d)).  Nor would use be rebutted by lack of ownership.  See United States v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393 (1st Cir.1992).  The jury, further, could reject defendant's claim that the gun belonged to his sister's former boyfriend, and that he was merely hiding it from his nephews.  While mere possession is not a crime, the government properly asked the jury, why did he keep it?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendant that the word \"uses\" calls for something more than \"possesses.\"   We may further agree that in defendant's transaction with the officers he did not use the gun, and had no intent to.  The difficulty is that the drug trafficking crime, as defined in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1), with which he was charged was possession with intent, not the sale.  We have held that mere presence of arms for the protection of drugs for sale is present use.  United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22 (1st Cir.)  (guns in duffel bag with cocaine), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2813, 115 L.Ed.2d 985 (1991);  United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987 (1st Cir.1990) (guns on the drug premises), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991).  Wilkinson's taking guns with the drugs to someone else's house would seem active use.  And it is true that defendant Hadfield publicly advertised that he had guns, clearly a present use as a deterrent.  However, we based our opinion broadly, on simple presence for protection, the maintenance of a \"fortress.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It could be said that mere maintenance of a secret fortress is not a present use, but is an intent regarding possible future use.  However, we did not, and the majority of the circuits do not, draw that distinction.  See United States v. Wesley, 990 F.2d 360, 365 (8th Cir.1993) (\"presence and ready availability of a firearm at a house where drugs are dealt\" is sufficient);  United States v.

It can not be for the court to control the U.S. Attorney's use of this truly fortress of a statute;  a defendant's only hope is the U.S. Attorney's judgment, and the jury.

We have examined his several contentions with care, but they require little comment.  Defendant's complaints as to the charge, and to the weight of the evidence, are in accord with his claims on the acquittal, and must fail equally.  The court's adjustments and failure to adjust the sentence on Count One were, routinely, within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A word as to the dissent.  We share in approving the flexibility of the Sentencing Guidelines, but we see no give, and no surrender, in this monolith of a statute, on the books for many years and not disturbed when the Guidelines were enacted.  Moreover, how does one measure for this?   And in what way do our differing facts, on a case by case basis, indicate that we are taking a new approach?   Only one gun?   Possible lack of title?   No ammunition?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Lack of exhibiting?   No instant access?   Under our cases none of these failures is fatal.  The reason for this is that the difference between mere possession and use is in the mind of the user.  United States v. Payero, 888 F.2d 928, 929 (1st Cir.1989) (possession lending courage is use);  Wilkinson, 926 F.2d at 25 (\"emboldening,\" quoting United States v. Stewart, 779 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir.1985));  United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied sub nom Sarraff v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993) (possession with \"intent to have it available for possible use\");  Wilkinson at 26 (\"intended the guns for protection\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Was the stash too small to make intent more than a theoretical possibility?   Even without defendant's admission, \"It's good protection for anyone in the neighborhood to have a gun in their house also because people get robbed,\" we cannot think that $360 in drugs plus $510 in cash, would not warrant a jury's finding that defendant's thinking included the gun.  The statute does not measure the crime.  In light of the accounts we read daily of mayhem over trifles, we adopt what we said in Wilkinson, (and remembering what Wilkinson itself said was \"help\"), \"[U]ltimately, whether or not the gun[ ] helped appellant commit the drug crime is a matter for a jury, applying common-sense theories of human nature and causation.\"  926 F.2d at 26.   This is not to say that it need \"automatically\" find it.  Nor is it to say that we like the inflexibility of this statute, or the judgment of the United States Attorney in invoking it for such a minor defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded to the district court to vacate the acquittal;  reinstate the verdict of guilty on Count Two;  to sentence on Count Two, and to readjust the sentence on Count One appropriately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BREYER, Chief Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow legal question before this panel is not whether possession of a gun (\"in relation to the [drug] crime\") means a longer sentence for a convicted drug dealer.  It most certainly does.  Nor is the question whether the \"possession\" here was \"in relation to\" the drug crime,  ante at 464-65.  It was.  Rather, the question concerns which sentencing statute governs the precise length of the extra term of punishment, a blunt \"mandatory minimum\" gun \"use\" statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (mandatory five-year sentence), or the somewhat more sophisticated sentencing guideline statutes, under which extra punishment for drug-related gun possession varies with the seriousness of the drug crime.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) (2-level sentence enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this question turns on the meaning of a single word in the \"mandatory minimum\" statute, the word \"use.\"   Does that word \"use \" include simple \"possession\" of a gun \"connected with\" a drug crime?   If so, the majority is right, for I have no doubt that the jury here could find both a \"possession\" and some kind of \"relation\" or \"connection\" between gun and crime.  But, in my view, prior cases, and likely congressional intent, indicate that the word \"use,\" in this particular statute, carries a more active meaning--a meaning that excludes simple (drug-crime-related) possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me be more specific.  The special \"mandatory minimum\" sentencing statute says that anyone who \"uses or carries \" a gun \"during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime\" must receive a mandatory five-year prison term added on to his drug crime sentence.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  At the same time, the Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated under the authority of a different statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994, provide for a two-level (i.e., a 30% to 40%) sentence enhancement where a \"firearm ... was possessed\" by a drug offender, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), unless the possession clearly was not \"connected with the [drug] offense.\"   Id. app. n. 3.  The Guideline enhancement for drug-crime-related gun possession may amount to less than five additional years, as it would here.  The specific question before us is whether, for sentencing purposes, courts should try to distinguish between a gun's drug-crime-related \"use\" and its drug-crime-related \"possession,\" particularly when the predicate drug crime is \"possession with intent to distribute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts might have simplified the matter by answering this question in the negative.  They might have reasoned that, at least in drug possession cases, virtually any possession of a gun amounts to \"use\" within the meaning of Sec. 924(c).  Arguably, any gun that is both possessed by a drug offender, and present at or near the site of a drug possession crime, helps the offender carry out the drug crime.  It might do this by \"emboldening\" him, or perhaps by being available, should the need arise, to frighten others or to protect the drugs possessed.  Cf. United States v. Stewart, 779 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir.1985).  Until today, however, courts have not taken this approach.  On the contrary, they have insisted on maintaining a significant distinction between \"possession\" and \"use\" of a gun by drug offenders in the context of prosecutions under Sec. 924(c).    United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993);   United States v. Payero, 888 F.2d 928, 929 (1st Cir.1989);   United States v. Robinson, 997 F.2d 884, 887 (D.C.Cir.1993) (statute \"conspicuously fails to criminalize mere possession\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditional tools of statutory interpretation support the near-universal judicial effort to maintain the distinction between (drug-related) \"use\" and \"possession.\"   First, the ordinary meanings of the words \"use\" and \"carry\"--the language in the \"mandatory minimum\" statute--connote activity beyond simple possession.  Cf. Smith v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2054, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (the term \"use\" is to be given its \"ordinary or natural meaning\" in construing Sec. 924(c)).  Second, Congress wrote those words in the context of gun crime statutes that often use the broader word \"possess\" to describe the prohibited gun-related conduct.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g), (q)(1)(A).  As the somewhat hackneyed judicial aphorism goes, when Congress wants to criminalize gun possession, it knows how to do so.  Third, a House Report accompanying the 1986 amendment to Sec. 924(c) (which extended the statute to drug crimes) provides some indication of Congress's expectation about the meaning of the word \"use.\"   In the course of discussing the \"carrying\" part of the statute, the Report offers the example of a drug trafficker who \"carrie[s]\" a weapon \"for protection against rival traffickers.\"   Such a person quite clearly \"possesses\" the weapon with the intent to make active use of it if necessary;  yet, the Report adds, \"he did not actually use the weapon.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 495, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1327, 1336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, courts normally try to read language in different, but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile those statutes, in light of their purposes and of common sense.  In this instance, one relevant statute, the statute creating the Sentencing Guidelines, reflects a major congressional effort to create a fairly sophisticated Sentencing Guidelines system that distinguishes among different kinds of criminal behavior and punishes accordingly.  The other statute, the mandatory minimum statute, represents an ad hoc deviation from that more general policy.  Given the importance (to Congress) of the Guidelines system, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 363-370, 109 S.Ct. 647, 650-654, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), courts should take care not to interpret other statutes that represent ad hoc deviations from the basic congressionally-directed effort to rationalize sentencing with unnecessary breadth.  Yet, here, to interpret the word \"use\" to encompass \"possession\" is to swallow up a guideline that distinguishes, for punishment purposes, among different kinds of drug- and gun-related criminal behavior.  Moreover, it is to swallow up the guideline unnecessarily, for neither the language of the mandatory minimum statute nor its purpose (the need to punish drug offenders with guns) requires that it do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I confess that it is easier to see the need to distinguish (drug-crime-related) \"use\" from \"possession\" than it is to explain just how to make the distinction.  Courts might have interpreted \"use\" by insisting upon activity with the gun, such as firing it or brandishing it, or, at least, displaying it (or even trading it for drugs, see Smith, supra ).   But they have not done this.  Rather, they have held that the word \"use\" sometimes encompasses more passive activity, such as \"possession,\" but sometimes it does not.  Thus, we must try to articulate the distinguishing line they have drawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I read the case law, when courts have held that \"use\" encompasses \"possession,\" they have always found (1) possession, (2) in connection with a drug crime, and (3) something more.  See United States v. Wilson, 884 F.2d 174, 177 (5th Cir.1989) (except in \"drug fortress\" cases involving large amounts of drugs and money, \"something more than strategic proximity of drugs and firearms is necessary to honor Congress' concerns.\").  And, they have tended to describe this \"something more\" as possession of the guns for protection of the drugs, thereby \"facilitat[ing]\" the drug crime.  See, e.g., United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.)  (conviction sustained where circumstances allowed jury to find that defendant \"intended the guns for protection\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2813, 115 L.Ed.2d 985 (1991);  United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 998 (1st Cir.1990) (conviction sustained \"so long as one purpose in situating the weapon nearby was to protect the narcotics enterprise\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991);  United States v. Payero, 888 F.2d 928, 929 (1st Cir.1989) (conviction possible where firearm gave defendant courage by allowing him to protect himself);  United States v. Bruce, 939 F.2d 1053, 1055 (D.C.Cir.1991) (guns may be \"used\" in relation to a possession crime \"because they are intended to protect the stash of drugs that will subsequently be distributed\");   ante at 465 (\"mere presence of arms for the protection of drugs for sale is present use\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, language such as \"possession for protection\" would not help the problem very much if that language itself were broadly interpreted or applied.  If, for example, courts simply said that possession of a gun when drugs are around means a fortiori that the gun is present \"for protection\" of the drugs, the mandatory minimum statute's word \"use\" would (once again) swallow up the Guideline and eradicate the distinction between \"use\" and \"possession\" that courts have tried to maintain.  It is therefore not surprising that the courts have not interpreted or applied this language broadly.  They have avoided the \"swallowing up\" result by applying the \"possession for protection\" concept only where circumstances demonstrate that a drug offender, possessing a gun (in connection with the crime), would likely put the gun to active use (such as firing or brandishing it, or at least displaying it in an effort to intimidate) were the need to arise.   In determining whether this later, active use is likely (i.e., in separating a theoretical possibility from a real risk), courts have looked at such factors as the gun's accessibility, whether it is loaded, the amount of drugs possessed, the presence of other guns, and the extent to which dangerous transactions likely take place nearby, as a way of deciding whether the \"circumstances of the case show\" that the gun was present for protection.  United States v. Plummer, 964 F.2d 1251, 1254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 350, 121 L.Ed.2d 265 (1992);  see, e.g., Robinson, 997 F.2d at 887 (listing factors);  United States v. Derr, 990 F.2d 1330, 1338 (D.C.Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examined in light of the case law's possession/use distinction, the record before us indicates that this drug offender's \"possession\" of the gun, even if related to the drug crime, does not rise to the level of a \"use.\"   The defendant here was a small-time drug dealer, selling drugs in $20 packages.  The police found a shotgun, unloaded, wrapped in a cloth bag, hidden between his bed's mattress and its box spring (but next to $40 the police had paid him, and above a strongbox on the floor containing two grams of cocaine and $510 cash).  They found no ammunition anywhere in the apartment.  The defendant testified, without contradiction and consistently with an earlier government affidavit, that the gun belonged to someone else.  The gun was not visible, so its mere presence could not automatically have frightened a buyer or intruder.  The defendant did not brandish, display, touch, or mention the gun during the transaction with police, nor was there any evidence that he had ever done so during the time he possessed drugs.  To make active use of the gun in protecting his drugs or intimidating a buyer or intruder, he would have had to lift the mattress, seize the gun, and unwrap it.  To fire the gun, the defendant would have had to find ammunition, bring it to the apartment, and load the gun.  The small amount of cocaine possessed makes it somewhat less likely that, in fact, he had (or would have) done either.  In context, the defendant's \"admission,\"  ante at 466, does not seem particularly relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility that any gun that is present, the way this gun was present, might be put to active \"use.\"   But that is so virtually whenever a gun is present near the scene of a drug crime.  To find a \"possession for protection\" (i.e., a \"use\") here is, in effect, to find that possession of a gun (when related to a drug crime) automatically means a \"use.\"   It thereby erases the line that the statutes, and the courts, have tried to draw, and again allows the \"use\" statute to swallow up the \"possession\" Guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A brief review of these cases indicates rather strong support for the distinction I am drawing.  Consider cases in which courts have permitted a jury to infer that a defendant \"used\" nearby guns to \"protect\" a stash of drugs.  They involve drug-related risks of actually firing or brandishing (or \"carry[ing]\") the gun that are significantly greater than the risks present here.  In this circuit's Hadfield case, for example, the inference--that the defendant \"used\" the guns to \"protect\" the drugs--was neither uncertain nor theoretical:  it was inescapable.  The defendants ran a massive drug operation from a barn that contained hundreds of marijuana plants, thousands of dollars in cash, and several guns, at least two of which were loaded, standing on a nearby gun rack or hanging on the barn walls.  A sign near the barn said, \"This house guarded by shotgun three nights per week.  You guess which three.\"  918 F.2d at 991.   A clearer case of using guns for protection is hard to imagine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Wilkinson case, although closer, presented a somewhat different legal question.  There, the defendant \"carr[ied]\" with him to a friend's house a duffel bag that contained two loaded guns (wrapped in a towel) and a cache of drugs (although the Wilkinson opinion is silent on the point, the record indicates that the guns were loaded).  The proximity of loaded guns to the drugs and the fact that the defendant was carrying them together from place to place permitted the jury to infer that the defendant \"intended the guns for protection,\" and thus that he carried them \"in relation to\" his drug crime.  Id. at 25-26.  (Since Wilkinson involved the statutory terms \"carry\" and \"in relation to,\" strictly speaking it did not raise the \"use/possession\" problem here discussed.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, other cases allowing an inference of presence \"for protection\" have involved close proximity and loaded guns, or large drug operations, or multiple weapons, or easy accessibility, or some factor suggesting more than a theoretical possibility that the guns might be used to protect the drugs if necessary.  See, e.g., Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 983 (gun was \"near a large sum of cash, in close proximity to live ammunition\" while defendant was \"taking delivery of a sizable quantity of cocaine\");  Plummer, 964 F.2d at 1254 (gun in defendant's car with ammunition in easy reach of driver;  evidence that defendant \"had moved\" the gun);  United States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1466 (1st Cir.)  (five weapons in apartment with \"significant amount\" of drugs;  testimony and palmprint connected the guns to defendants' drug operation), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1695, 118 L.Ed.2d 406 (1992);  see also United States v. Wesley, 990 F.2d 360 (8th Cir.1993) (fully loaded gun found on floor within reach of sleeping defendant);  United States v. Hager, 969 F.2d 883 (10th Cir.)  (three guns, at least one loaded, found near 2.8 kilograms of cocaine in apartment), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 437, 121 L.Ed.2d 357 (1992);  United States v. Torres-Medina, 935 F.2d 1047 (9th Cir.1991) (loaded gun found next to cocaine);  United States v. Boyd, 885 F.2d 246 (5th Cir.1989) (loaded shotgun in arm's reach of defendant near methamphetamine manufacturing operation;  agent testified that defendant had taken shotgun from car with drug paraphernalia and took it with him during a subsequent journey);  United States v. Acosta-Cazares, 878 F.2d 945 (6th Cir.)  (\"numerous loaded weapons,\" thousands of dollars in cash, and two kilograms of cocaine found in two apartments used by coconspirators;  coconspirator testified that defendant carried weapons while engaging in drug transactions), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 899, 110 S.Ct. 255, 107 L.Ed.2d 204 (1989);  United States v. Anderson, 881 F.2d 1128 (D.C.Cir.1989) (crack house contained several loaded weapons, large quantities of crack cocaine, cocaine powder, and cash;  expert testimony indicated that weapons frequently protect \"crack houses\");  United States v. Matra, 841 F.2d 837 (8th Cir.1988) (fortress contained numerous loaded weapons, ammunition, thousands of dollars of cash, and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consider, by way of contrast, cases in which courts have refused to permit the jury to infer that the defendant \"used\" nearby guns to protect a stash of drugs.  Many seem to involve risks of firing or brandishing (or displaying) a gun at least as great as those present here;  in some, the risk seems greater.  In United States v. Robinson, the D.C.Circuit refused to permit a \"used for protection\" inference where a defendant kept an unloaded pistol and drugs in a locked footlocker in a closet (the footlocker, in contrast with Wilkinson, apparently was not \"carried\" from place to place).  997 F.2d 884, 887-88 (D.C.Cir.1993).  In United States v. Sullivan, 919 F.2d 1403 (10th Cir.1990), even though defendant kept an unregistered gun in her home where she also maintained a drug laboratory (and was convicted for possession of an unregistered firearm), the court refused to permit the \"protection\" inference because no additional evidence supported an intent to use the weapon in that way with respect to the drug operation.  Id. at 1432 &amp; n. 45.   In United States v. Derr, 990 F.2d 1330 (D.C.Cir.1993), the court would not permit the inference where the defendant kept an unloaded pistol and his drug supply in a locked closet.  See also, e.g., United States v. Matthews, 942 F.2d 779, 783-84 (10th Cir.1991) (reversing Sec. 924(c) conviction where, despite presence of weapons in plain view in an apartment containing drugs, evidence did not suggest that defendant \"intended to avail himself of the firearms\");  United States v. Bruce, 939 F.2d 1053, 1055-56 (D.C.Cir.1991) (reversing Sec. 924(c) conviction because presence of loaded gun in one pocket and drugs in other pockets of defendant's raincoat indicated intent to use the gun in connection with future distribution, not protection of present possession).  The theoretical possibility of active use was always present in these cases, but the courts considered it too remote to allow a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the gun was present \"for protection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one might simply argue that these cases are not all consistent with each other.  However, whether or not that is so seems to me beside the point.  The division in the case law indicates a perceived need to draw a legal line between simple possession of a gun and its use.  In order to draw that line, one must say that at some point, the risk that a defendant will actually fire or brandish or display a nearby gun \"to protect\" a drug stash becomes too small to permit the jury to infer an intent to protect.  Our previous cases lie on one side of that line.  If we are to maintain the legal distinction that courts have tried to draw (and if we are to avoid collapsing the \"possession\" Guideline into the mandatory five-year term of the \"use\" statute), this case, as the district court held, must lie on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n        <p>1 U.S.S.G.

The statute does not measure the crime.  In light of the accounts we read daily of mayhem over trifles, we adopt what we said in Wilkinson, (and remembering what Wilkinson itself said was \"help\"), \"[U]ltimately, whether or not the gun[ ] helped appellant commit the drug crime is a matter for a jury, applying common-sense theories of human nature and causation.\"  926 F.2d at 26.

It most certainly does.  Nor is the question whether the \"possession\" here was \"in relation to\" the drug crime,  ante at 464-65.  It was.  Rather, the question concerns which sentencing statute governs the precise length of the extra term of punishment, a blunt \"mandatory minimum\" gun \"use\" statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) (mandatory five-year sentence), or the somewhat more sophisticated sentencing guideline statutes, under which extra punishment for drug-related gun possession varies with the seriousness of the drug crime.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) (2-level sentence enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this question turns on the meaning of a single word in the \"mandatory minimum\" statute, the word \"use.\"   Does that word \"use \" include simple \"possession\" of a gun \"connected with\" a drug crime?   If so, the majority is right, for I have no doubt that the jury here could find both a \"possession\" and some kind of \"relation\" or \"connection\" between gun and crime.  But, in my view, prior cases, and likely congressional intent, indicate that the word \"use,\" in this particular statute, carries a more active meaning--a meaning that excludes simple (drug-crime-related) possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me be more specific.  The special \"mandatory minimum\" sentencing statute says that anyone who \"uses or carries \" a gun \"during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime\" must receive a mandatory five-year prison term added on to his drug crime sentence.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  At the same time, the Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated under the authority of a different statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994, provide for a two-level (i.e., a 30% to 40%) sentence enhancement where a \"firearm ... was possessed\" by a drug offender, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), unless the possession clearly was not \"connected with the [drug] offense.\"   Id. app. n. 3.  The Guideline enhancement for drug-crime-related gun possession may amount to less than five additional years, as it would here.  The specific question before us is whether, for sentencing purposes, courts should try to distinguish between a gun's drug-crime-related \"use\" and its drug-crime-related \"possession,\" particularly when the predicate drug crime is \"possession with intent to distribute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts might have simplified the matter by answering this question in the negative.  They might have reasoned that, at least in drug possession cases, virtually any possession of a gun amounts to \"use\" within the meaning of Sec. 924(c).  Arguably, any gun that is both possessed by a drug offender, and present at or near the site of a drug possession crime, helps the offender carry out the drug crime.  It might do this by \"emboldening\" him, or perhaps by being available, should the need arise, to frighten others or to protect the drugs possessed.  Cf. United States v. Stewart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462359\"><a href=\"/opinion/462359/united-states-v-richard-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 540 (9th Cir.1985).  Until today, however, courts have not taken this approach.  On the contrary, they have insisted on maintaining a significant distinction between \"possession\" and \"use\" of a gun by drug offenders in the context of prosecutions under Sec. 924(c).

Cf. Smith v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span> (1993) (the term \"use\" is to be given its \"ordinary or natural meaning\" in construing Sec. 924(c)).  Second, Congress wrote those words in the context of gun crime statutes that often use the broader word \"possess\" to describe the prohibited gun-related conduct.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g), (q)(1)(A).  As the somewhat hackneyed judicial aphorism goes, when Congress wants to criminalize gun possession, it knows how to do so.  Third, a House Report accompanying the 1986 amendment to Sec. 924(c) (which extended the statute to drug crimes) provides some indication of Congress's expectation about the meaning of the word \"use.\"   In the course of discussing the \"carrying\" part of the statute, the Report offers the example of a drug trafficker who \"carrie[s]\" a weapon \"for protection against rival traffickers.\"   Such a person quite clearly \"possesses\" the weapon with the intent to make active use of it if necessary;  yet, the Report adds, \"he did not actually use the weapon.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 495, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1327, 1336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, courts normally try to read language in different, but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile those statutes, in light of their purposes and of common sense.  In this instance, one relevant statute, the statute creating the Sentencing Guidelines, reflects a major congressional effort to create a fairly sophisticated Sentencing Guidelines system that distinguishes among different kinds of criminal behavior and punishes accordingly.  The other statute, the mandatory minimum statute, represents an ad hoc deviation from that more general policy.  Given the importance (to Congress) of the Guidelines system, see Mistretta v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 363-370, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1989), courts should take care not to interpret other statutes that represent ad hoc deviations from the basic congressionally-directed effort to rationalize sentencing with unnecessary breadth.  Yet, here, to interpret the word \"use\" to encompass \"possession\" is to swallow up a guideline that distinguishes, for punishment purposes, among different kinds of drug- and gun-related criminal behavior.  Moreover, it is to swallow up the guideline unnecessarily, for neither the language of the mandatory minimum statute nor its purpose (the need to punish drug offenders with guns) requires that it do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I confess that it is easier to see the need to distinguish (drug-crime-related) \"use\" from \"possession\" than it is to explain just how to make the distinction.  Courts might have interpreted \"use\" by insisting upon activity with the gun, such as firing it or brandishing it, or, at least, displaying it (or even trading it for drugs, see Smith, supra ).   But they have not done this.  Rather, they have held that the word \"use\" sometimes encompasses more passive activity, such as \"possession,\" but sometimes it does not.  Thus, we must try to articulate the distinguishing line they have drawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I read the case law, when courts have held that \"use\" encompasses \"possession,\" they have always found (1) possession, (2) in connection with a drug crime, and (3) something more.  See United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span>, 177 (5th Cir.1989) (except in \"drug fortress\" cases involving large amounts of drugs and money, \"something more than strategic proximity of drugs and firearms is necessary to honor Congress' concerns.\").  And, they have tended to describe this \"something more\" as possession of the guns for protection of the drugs, thereby \"facilitat[ing]\" the drug crime.  See, e.g., United States v. Wilkinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556387\"><a href=\"/opinion/556387/united-states-v-robert-j-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.)

If, for example, courts simply said that possession of a gun when drugs are around means a fortiori that the gun is present \"for protection\" of the drugs, the mandatory minimum statute's word \"use\" would (once again) swallow up the Guideline and eradicate the distinction between \"use\" and \"possession\" that courts have tried to maintain.  It is therefore not surprising that the courts have not interpreted or applied this language broadly.  They have avoided the \"swallowing up\" result by applying the \"possession for protection\" concept only where circumstances demonstrate that a drug offender, possessing a gun (in connection with the crime), would likely put the gun to active use (such as firing or brandishing it, or at least displaying it in an effort to intimidate) were the need to arise.   In determining whether this later, active use is likely (i.e., in separating a theoretical possibility from a real risk), courts have looked at such factors as the gun's accessibility, whether it is loaded, the amount of drugs possessed, the presence of other guns, and the extent to which dangerous transactions likely take place nearby, as a way of deciding whether the \"circumstances of the case show\" that the gun was present for protection.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></span> (1992);  see, e.g., Robinson, 997 F.2d at 887 (listing factors);  United States v. Derr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604764\"><a href=\"/opinion/604764/united-states-v-tyrone-derr/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1330</span></a></span>, 1338 (D.C.Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examined in light of the case law's possession/use distinction, the record before us indicates that this drug offender's \"possession\" of the gun, even if related to the drug crime, does not rise to the level of a \"use.\"   The defendant here was a small-time drug dealer, selling drugs in $20 packages.  The police found a shotgun, unloaded, wrapped in a cloth bag, hidden between his bed's mattress and its box spring (but next to $40 the police had paid him, and above a strongbox on the floor containing two grams of cocaine and $510 cash).  They found no ammunition anywhere in the apartment.  The defendant testified, without contradiction and consistently with an earlier government affidavit, that the gun belonged to someone else.  The gun was not visible, so its mere presence could not automatically have frightened a buyer or intruder.  The defendant did not brandish, display, touch, or mention the gun during the transaction with police, nor was there any evidence that he had ever done so during the time he possessed drugs.  To make active use of the gun in protecting his drugs or intimidating a buyer or intruder, he would have had to lift the mattress, seize the gun, and unwrap it.  To fire the gun, the defendant would have had to find ammunition, bring it to the apartment, and load the gun.  The small amount of cocaine possessed makes it somewhat less likely that, in fact, he had (or would have) done either.  In context, the defendant's \"admission,\"  ante at 466, does not seem particularly relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility that any gun that is present, the way this gun was present, might be put to active \"use.\"   But that is so virtually whenever a gun is present near the scene of a drug crime.  To find a \"possession for protection\" (i.e., a \"use\") here is, in effect, to find that possession of a gun (when related to a drug crime) automatically means a \"use.\"   It thereby erases the line that the statutes, and the courts, have tried to draw, and again allows the \"use\" statute to swallow up the \"possession\" Guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A brief review of these cases indicates rather strong support for the distinction I am drawing.  Consider cases in which courts have permitted a jury to infer that a defendant \"used\" nearby guns to \"protect\" a stash of drugs.  They involve drug-related risks of actually firing or brandishing (or \"carry[ing]\") the gun that are significantly greater than the risks present here.  In this circuit's Hadfield case, for example, the inference--that the defendant \"used\" the guns to \"protect\" the drugs--was neither uncertain nor theoretical:  it was inescapable.  The defendants ran a massive drug operation from a barn that contained hundreds of marijuana plants, thousands of dollars in cash, and several guns, at least two of which were loaded, standing on a nearby gun rack or hanging on the barn walls.  A sign near the barn said, \"This house guarded by shotgun three nights per week.  You guess which three.\"  918 F.2d at 991.   A clearer case of using guns for protection is hard to imagine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Wilkinson case, although closer, presented a somewhat different legal question.  There, the defendant \"carr[ied]\" with him to a friend's house a duffel bag that contained two loaded guns (wrapped in a towel) and a cache of drugs (although the Wilkinson opinion is silent on the point, the record indicates that the guns were loaded).  The proximity of loaded guns to the drugs and the fact that the defendant was carrying them together from place to place permitted the jury to infer that the defendant \"intended the guns for protection,\" and thus that he carried them \"in relation to\" his drug crime.  Id. at 25-26.  (Since Wilkinson involved the statutory terms \"carry\" and \"in relation to,\" strictly speaking it did not raise the \"use/possession\" problem here discussed.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, other cases allowing an inference of presence \"for protection\" have involved close proximity and loaded guns, or large drug operations, or multiple weapons, or easy accessibility, or some factor suggesting more than a theoretical possibility that the guns might be used to protect the drugs if necessary.  See, e.g., Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 983 (gun was \"near a large sum of cash, in close proximity to live ammunition\" while defendant was \"taking delivery of a sizable quantity of cocaine\");  Plummer, 964 F.2d at 1254 (gun in defendant's car with ammunition in easy reach of driver;  evidence that defendant \"had moved\" the gun);  United States v.

Many seem to involve risks of firing or brandishing (or displaying) a gun at least as great as those present here;  in some, the risk seems greater.  In United States v. Robinson, the D.C.Circuit refused to permit a \"used for protection\" inference where a defendant kept an unloaded pistol and drugs in a locked footlocker in a closet (the footlocker, in contrast with Wilkinson, apparently was not \"carried\" from place to place).  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610794\"><a href=\"/opinion/610794/united-states-v-candisha-s-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 887-88 (D.C.Cir.1993).  In United States v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552246\"><a href=\"/opinion/552246/united-states-v-russell-sullivan-mary-ann-sullivan-eugene-lewis-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1990), even though defendant kept an unregistered gun in her home where she also maintained a drug laboratory (and was convicted for possession of an unregistered firearm), the court refused to permit the \"protection\" inference because no additional evidence supported an intent to use the weapon in that way with respect to the drug operation.  Id. at 1432 &amp; n. 45.   In United States v. Derr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604764\"><a href=\"/opinion/604764/united-states-v-tyrone-derr/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1330</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1993), the court would not permit the inference where the defendant kept an unloaded pistol and his drug supply in a locked closet.  See also, e.g., United States v. Matthews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566915\"><a href=\"/opinion/566915/united-states-v-byron-w-matthews/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span>, 783-84 (10th Cir.1991) (reversing Sec. 924(c) conviction where, despite presence of weapons in plain view in an apartment containing drugs, evidence did not suggest that defendant \"intended to avail himself of the firearms\");  United States v. Bruce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565150\"><a href=\"/opinion/565150/united-states-v-bernardo-bruce/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1055-56 (D.C.Cir.1991) (reversing Sec. 924(c) conviction because presence of loaded gun in one pocket and drugs in other pockets of defendant's raincoat indicated intent to use the gun in connection with future distribution, not protection of present possession).  The theoretical possibility of active use was always present in these cases, but the courts considered it too remote to allow a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the gun was present \"for protection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one might simply argue that these cases are not all consistent with each other.  However, whether or not that is so seems to me beside the point.  The division in the case law indicates a perceived need to draw a legal line between simple possession of a gun and its use.  In order to draw that line, one must say that at some point, the risk that a defendant will actually fire or brandish or display a nearby gun \"to protect\" a drug stash becomes too small to permit the jury to infer an intent to protect.  Our previous cases lie on one side of that line.  If we are to maintain the legal distinction that courts have tried to draw (and if we are to avoid collapsing the \"possession\" Guideline into the mandatory five-year term of the \"use\" statute), this case, as the district court held, must lie on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n        <p>1 U.S.S.G.
