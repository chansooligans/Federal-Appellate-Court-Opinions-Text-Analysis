Appellant José Morales-de Jesús (\"Morales-de\n\nJesús\") filed a complaint against Metropolitan Life Insurance\n\nCompany (\"MetLife\"), the administrator of his employer's long term\n\ndisability    pension    plan      (the   \"Plan\"),      for   violations        of   the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.         Morales-de Jesús filed his claim after the\n\nthree-year contractual limitations period provided for under the\n\nPlan had expired.       He now appeals the district court's decision to\n\ndismiss his claims with prejudice based on the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommendation concluding that the claims were time barred.\n\n            Morales-de Jesús argues that the district court erred by\n\nnot   applying    the   doctrine     of     equitable    estoppel     to   preclude\n\nMetLife's reliance on its untimeliness defense.                 To establish that\n\nthe court should apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the\n\nparty asserting the estoppel must show: 1) the party to be estopped\n\nfrom asserting an untimeliness defense knew the facts; 2) the party\n\nto be estopped intended that his conduct be acted on or acted in a\n\nway that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it\n\nwas   so   intended;    3)   the    party    requesting       the   application      of\n\nestoppel    was   ignorant    of    the     true   facts;     and    4)   the    party\n\nrequesting the application of estoppel relied on the other party's\n\nconduct to his detriment.          Vistamar, Inc. v. Fagundo-Fagundo, 430\n\nF.3d 66, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).                We adopt the reasoning of the\n\ndistrict court, which adopted the persuasive reasoning of the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fmagistrate judge, to the extent it concluded that Morales-de Jesús\n\nfailed to establish the elements required for the application of\n\nequitable estoppel.\n\n          After a careful review of the record and the parties'\n\nbriefs, we conclude that \"no substantial question is presented.\"\n\n1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).    We therefore affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
