He appeals the\n\ncourt's finding  that he was subject  to sentence enhancement\n\nas  an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.   924(e)(1), the\n\nsentencing range calculation under    4B1.4 of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, and  the  imposition upon  him  of the  costs  of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n          The brief filed by defendant's attorney states that\n\nthe first two grounds on appeal are raised in accordance with\n\nAnders v.

As we agree that\n\nthe Anders-briefed  issues are indeed frivolous,  and we find\n          \n\nno other  arguable legal  issues after reviewing  the record,\n\nthe  case  may  be  determined  without  further  adversarial\n\npresentation.  Penson, 488 U.S. at 82, 83-84.\n                     \n\n                             -2-\n\n          Under    924(e) a  person convicted of  violating  \n\n922(g) is  subject to  sentence enhancement if  he has  three\n\nprevious convictions for  a violent felony or  a serious drug\n\noffense  or both.  Defendant  concedes that two  of his prior\n\noffenses were properly classified as \"violent\" felonies under\n\n18  U.S.C.    924(e).1   He  takes  issue, however,  with the\n\ncourt's   classification  of   three   other   prior   felony\n\nconvictions  as \"violent.\"   Two of the  three convictions at\n\nissue  were entered on pleas of nolo contendere to charges of\n\nbreaking  and entering under R.I. Gen. Laws   11-8-3  (1969),\n\nR.I. Gen.  Laws   11-8-3 (1981);  the third was on  a plea of\n\nguilty to  assault with  a dangerous  weapon under  R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws   11-5-2 (1969).  \n\n          As to  the two  breaking and  entering convictions,\n\ndefendant  argues  that  these   crimes  do  not  qualify  as\n\npredicate  \"violent\" offenses  because the  state's statutory\n\n                    \n\n1.      924(e)(2)(B) defines \"violent\" felony as: \n          ... any crime punishable  by imprisonment\n          for a term exceeding one year, or any act\n          of juvenile delinquency involving the use\n          or  carrying  of  a  firearm,  knife,  or\n          destructive   device    that   would   be\n          punishable by imprisonment for  such term\n          if committed by an adult, that --\n               (i)   has  as  an element  the  use,\n          attempted  use  or   threatened  use   of\n          physical  force  against  the  person  of\n          another; or\n               (ii)   is    burglary,   arson,   or\n          extortion,    involves    the   use    of\n          explosives, or otherwise involves conduct\n          that presents a serious potential risk of\n          physical injury to another ....\n\n                             -3-\n\ndefinition  refers to  several offenses,  some of  which fall\n\noutside the  generic definition  of \"burglary.\"   The state's\n\ndefinition also does not  include a separately stated element\n\nof violence.  The charging documents in these cases, however,\n\nclearly reveal that in each case defendant was convicted of a\n\nfelony that fell squarely  within the \"generic\" definition of\n\nburglary  (unlawful entry of an  apartment with the intent of\n\ncommitting larceny, and unlawful entry of a building with the\n\nintent of  committing larceny). Taylor v.  United States, 495\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 575, 598 (1990); see United States v. Paleo, 967 F.2d 7,\n                                                \n\n10  (1st Cir. 1992)  (when statute includes  both generic and\n\nnon-generic  burglaries,  sentencing  court may  look  to the\n\ncharging  documents).   Despite the  absence of  a separately\n\nstated element  of violence,  Congress included  these crimes\n\namong the  predicate \"violent\" crimes under    924(e) because\n\nof  their \"inherent potential for  harm to persons.\"  Taylor,\n                                                            \n\n495 U.S. at 588; Paleo, 967 F.2d at 10.            \n                      \n\n          Defendant's conviction for assault with a dangerous\n\nweapon  is also  properly included  as a  predicate \"violent\"\n\ncrime for  sentence enhancement  purposes under    924(e)(1).\n\nBy  definition,  this  crime  \"has as  an  element  the  use,\n\nattempted use,  or threatened  use of physical  force against\n\nthe person of another.\"  18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B)(i); Taylor,\n                                                            \n\n495  U.S. at 600-601.   Accordingly, we need  not look beyond\n\nthe  fact of  conviction to  determine that  the crime  is an\n\n                             -4-\n\nappropriate predicate offense.   United  States v.  Bregnard,\n                                                            \n\n951  F.2d  457, 459  (1st  Cir.  1991) (Taylor's  categorical\n                                                \n\napproach extends  to the entire  enhancement statute),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112  S. Ct. 2939 (1992).2   Defendant's argument that\n      \n\n   924(e)(2)(B)   defines    assaults  as  violent  predicate\n\noffenses  only if they are accomplished with a \"gun, knife or\n\ndestructive device\" misreads the federal statute.  The quoted\n\nlanguage qualifies only crimes of juvenile delinquency; it is\n\nirrelevant to crimes committed by adult offenders.  \n\n          We also find  no error  in the  application of  the\n\nsentencing  guidelines.    As  defendant was  subject  to  an\n\nenhanced  sentence  under    924(e),  his  offense level  was\n\nproperly determined  under  4B1.4(a)(b)(3) to be 33.   With a\n\ndecrease of  two points  for acceptance of  responsibility to\n\n31, and a criminal  history level of VI, the  court correctly\n\nfound the guideline range to be 188-235 months.  As an aside,\n\n                    \n\n2.    Defendant  seemingly argues that  since he was  charged\nwith using an object  that was not inherently dangerous,  \"to\nwit,   a  stick,\"  the  state  statute  necessarily  includes\npotentially \"unharmful\"  types of assault.   This argument is\nbelied by  the statutory definition itself,  which requires a\n\"dangerous\" weapon,  and by the Rhode  Island courts' reading\nof the statute as requiring \"an unlawful offer to do corporal\ninjury to  another under such  circumstances as may  create a\nreasonable apprehension of immediate  injury ... coupled with\na present  ability to carry the offer into effect.\"  State v.\n                                                          \nJeremiah, 546 A.2d 183,  186 (R.I. 1988).  The  object itself\n        \nmust be either an inherently dangerous object or used in such\na way that serious bodily  harm may have resulted.  State  v.\n                                                         \nMercier, 415 A.2d  465, 467  (R.I. 1980).   Compare with  the\n                                                   \nstatute discussed in  United States v. Harris, 964  F.2d 1234\n                                             \n(1st Cir. 1992), and Bregnard, 951 F.2d at 459-60.  \n                             \n\n                             -5-\n\nwe note a typographical error on  the sentencing report, page\n\n5, where,  despite a correct computational  result, the total\n\noffense  level is reported as  \"23.\"  The  district court may\n\ncorrect this error at any time under Fed. R. Crim. P. 36.\n\n          Lastly,  defendant argues,  and the  government now\n\nconcedes, that  in light of  this court's decision  in United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Corral, 964 F.2d 83, 84 (1st Cir. 1992), issued one\n                \n\nday after the sentence imposed here, the  costs of supervised\n\nrelease should  not have been  imposed on the  defendant, who\n\nwas  found  indigent.   We thus  vacate  that portion  of the\n\nsentence.           In   accordance   with  Anders   we  have\n                                                  \n\nexamined  the entire  record  and find  no other  meritorious\n\nissues for  appeal.  Counsel's attention is  directed to Loc.\n\nR. 45.6.\n\n          Accordingly the judgment below is  affirmed in part\n                                                             \n\nand  vacated   and  remanded  in  part   for  corrections  in\n                                      \n\naccordance with this opinion.   \n\n                             -6-\n",

The charging documents in these cases, however,\n\nclearly reveal that in each case defendant was convicted of a\n\nfelony that fell squarely  within the \"generic\" definition of\n\nburglary  (unlawful entry of an  apartment with the intent of\n\ncommitting larceny, and unlawful entry of a building with the\n\nintent of  committing larceny).

The quoted\n\nlanguage qualifies only crimes of juvenile delinquency; it is\n\nirrelevant to crimes committed by adult offenders.  \n\n          We also find  no error  in the  application of  the\n\nsentencing  guidelines.    As  defendant was  subject  to  an\n\nenhanced  sentence  under    924(e),  his  offense level  was\n\nproperly determined  under  4B1.4(a)(b)(3) to be 33.   With a\n\ndecrease of  two points  for acceptance of  responsibility to\n\n31, and a criminal  history level of VI, the  court correctly\n\nfound the guideline range to be 188-235 months.  As an aside,\n\n                    \n\n2.    Defendant  seemingly argues that  since he was  charged\nwith using an object  that was not inherently dangerous,  \"to\nwit,   a  stick,\"  the  state  statute  necessarily  includes\npotentially \"unharmful\"  types of assault.   This argument is\nbelied by  the statutory definition itself,  which requires a\n\"dangerous\" weapon,  and by the Rhode  Island courts' reading\nof the statute as requiring \"an unlawful offer to do corporal\ninjury to  another under such  circumstances as may  create a\nreasonable apprehension of immediate  injury ... coupled with\na present  ability to carry the offer into effect.\"  State v.\n                                                          \nJeremiah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291968\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291968/state-v-jeremiah/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  186 (R.I. 1988).
