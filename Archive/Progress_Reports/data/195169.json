On  April  9,   1992,  law\n                             \n\nenforcement  agents armed with  a search warrant  entered the\n\nhome  of Pasquale  and Lisa Alosa  in Loudon,  New Hampshire.\n\nThe  search  uncovered   substantial  amounts  of  marijuana,\n\nmarijuana plants,  a  basement  \"garden\"  for  growing  them,\n\nscales,  plastic  bags,  two loaded  handguns,  and  16 other\n\nunloaded firearms.  Also found were two different collections\n\nof  papers which,  for simplicity,  have been referred  to as\n\nledgers.   A man named Robb Hamilton  was also present on the\n\npremises and was later implicated.\n\n     Both   Alosas  and  Hamilton  were  later  named  in  an\n\nindictment that,  as expanded  by  a superseding  indictment,\n\ncharged   Pasquale  and   Lisa  in   four   counts:  unlawful\n\nmanufacture of a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C.   841 (count\n\nI); possession with intent to distribute, id. (count II); use\n                                             \n\nof  a  firearm--namely,  the  two   handguns--during  and  in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime (count III), 18 U.S.C.  \n\n924(c)(1);  and   conspiracy  to  possess   with  intent   to\n\ndistribute, 21 U.S.C.   846 (count IV).  Hamilton was charged\n\nonly in count IV.\n\n     Prior to  trial Pasquale twice moved to  sever his trial\n\non the gun  count from his trial  on the other three  counts.\n\nThe first  request merely said  that Pasquale  \"may\" want  to\n\ntestify on the gun  count but remain silent on the others and\n\nwould be  prejudiced by  joinder of the  counts.   The second\n\n                             -2-\n\nrequest  said that  he did  not want  to testify  on anything\n\nother than the gun charge and was entitled to testify on that\n\ncharge to refute  the suggestions that the guns  were used in\n\ndrug trafficking.   This request also pointed to  its list of\n\nwitnesses  who would testify for Pasquale concerning his \"use\n\nand possession of  firearms.\"  The district court denied both\n\nrequests for severance.\n\n     Then,  during jury  selection in  August 1992,  Pasquale\n\nfiled a motion  in limine requesting  the court to  \"preclude\n                         \n\nthe government  or any  of the  co-defendants' counsel  [from\n\neliciting testimony  from him] regarding  matters outside the\n\nscope of his  [contemplated direct] testimony.\"   That direct\n\ntestimony,  the motion  said,  would  describe  his  longtime\n\ninvolvement  with firearms,  explain  his  reasons for  their\n\npossession,  and show  that they  were  not for  use in  drug\n\ntrafficking.  Pasquale also now  pled guilty to the first two\n\ncounts--manufacture and possession with intent to distribute-\n\n-and  he argued that this further diminished the government's\n\nneed to cross-examine him about his drug activities.\n\n     The district  court denied  the in  limine request.   It\n                                               \n\nreaffirmed this denial  when the request  was renewed at  the\n\nclose of  the government's  case in chief.   In  this renewed\n\nrequest,  Pasquale provided further detail as to his proposed\n\ntestimony, explaining that he would testify that the handguns\n\nwere  purchased  and  used  \"for   fun\"  and  not  for   drug\n\n                             -3-\n\ntrafficking.   In a post-trial order, the district court said\n\nthat it  refused to grant  the in limine requests  because \"a\n                                        \n\ndefendant's  testimony  invites cross  examination  on topics\n\nmade relevant by his direct testimony.\"\n\n     The  defendants  were  tried  together  using   multiple\n\njuries.1  Pasquale  did not testify  but did offer  witnesses\n\nwho  described his sporting and collector's interest in guns.\n\nOn August 31, 1992, the jury convicted Pasquale on counts III\n\nand  IV--the two  counts on  which  he had  not already  pled\n\nguilty--and  he now appeals from those convictions.  Lisa was\n\nconvicted  on counts  II and  IV and  acquitted on  the other\n\ncounts, but died in an automobile accident before sentencing.\n\nHamilton  was convicted of misdemeanor possession and has not\n\nappealed.\n\n     Pasquale's first argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred  in denying  his motions to  sever the  gun count\n\nfrom the  other counts.   Severance for undue prejudice  is a\n\nmatter committed to the sound discretion  of the trial judge,\n\nand a refusal  to sever will be overturned only  for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  E.g.,  United States v. Olivo-Infante,  938 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1406,  1409 (1st  Cir. 1991).   Further,  a refusal  to sever\n\n                    \n\n     1Prior to trial Lisa made  a number of admissions to the\nauthorities  concerning  the Alosas'  drug  sources, and  she\ndecoded  various of the  transaction entries in  the ledgers.\nBecause  some  evidence  admissible   against  her  was   not\nadmissible  against Pasquale, his jury was excused while such\nevidence was presented to her jury.\n\n                             -4-\n\nrelated counts, naming  the same defendant, may be  the least\n                                \n\nlikely candidate for  appellate reversal.  Still,  Pasquale's\n\ncounsel--who appears to  have played a  weak hand with  skill\n\nand  foresight--has built a  case somewhat stronger  than the\n\nusual general  claim of  potential  confusion or  \"spillover\"\n\neffects.\n\n     Rather,  Pasquale  has  sought shelter  in  a  doctrine,\n\ndeveloped elsewhere  but cited  approvingly in  this circuit,\n\nthat a defendant may deserve  a severance of counts where the\n\ndefendant  makes  \"a  convincing showing  that  `he  has both\n\nimportant testimony to  give concerning one count  and strong\n\nneed to  refrain from  testifying on the  other.'\"2   This in\n\nturn requires a defendant to  offer in timely fashion \"enough\n\ninformation\"  so that the court can weigh \"the considerations\n\nof  judicial economy\"  against  the  defendant's \"freedom  to\n\nchoose  whether  to  testify\"  as  to  a  particular  charge.\n\nScivola, 766 F.2d at 43.\n       \n\n     It may  be doubtful  whether, prior  to trial,  Pasquale\n\nexplained his position  in adequate detail; his  first motion\n\nwas bland  and conditional  and even  his second  was sparse.\n\nSee United  States v.  Tracy, 989 F.2d  1279, 1283  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1993).   Still, the  second request  suggested that  Pasquale\n\nwanted to testify in  order to deny  that the guns were  used\n\n                    \n\n     2United States  v. Scivola,  766 F.2d  37, 43 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n1985)  (quoting Baker  v. United  States, 401  F.2d 958,  977\n                                        \n(D.C. Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 965 (1970)).\n                              \n\n                             -5-\n\nfor  drug trafficking--a rather  simple proposition.   As for\n\nnot  testifying on other counts, Pasquale has never explained\n\nexactly what he feared.   But we prefer to treat  the case as\n\nif  Pasquale had  said what  we think  is apparent:  that the\n\ngovernment had overwhelming proof against him on counts I and\n\nII but little direct proof of conspiracy, and he did not wish\n\nto help it to close this gap.\n\n     Even  assuming that Pasquale  had said all  this plainly\n\nand at the outset, we think that the denial of  the severance\n\nwould still have  to be sustained.   The limited case  law on\n\nScivola-  type  motions  does  not  greatly  illuminate   the\n       \n\nquestion   just  how  \"important\"  must  be  the  defendant's\n\nproffered  testimony or what kind of \"strong\" reasons explain\n\nthe  need  not to  testify  on  other  counts.   But  obvious\n\nconsiderations of judicial economy support trying all related\n\ncounts against the same defendant at one time.  And while the\n\ncourts  zealously guard a  defendant's Fifth  Amendment right\n\nnot to testify at  all, the case law is less  protective of a\n\ndefendant's  right to  testify  selectively, addressing  some\n\nissues  while   withholding  testimony  on  others  that  are\n\nrelated.   See Brown v.  United States, 356 U.S.  148, 155-56\n                                      \n\n(1958).\n\n     The  facts of  this case  do  not argue  strongly for  a\n\nseverance.  Pasquale's testimony that the hand guns were \"for\n\nfun\"  might have  been  of  some help  to  him, although  his\n\n                             -6-\n\ngeneral \"gun  enthusiast\" story  was presented  through other\n\nwitnesses.  Even if he had testified, it is still unclear (no\n\nproffer was made)  how he could have explained  the fact that\n\none or  both of the  guns were apparently  loaded, one--found\n\nunder  his bed--was a  semi-automatic pistol and  the other--\n\nfound in  a drawer  near the  front door--was a  high-powered\n\n.357 magnum.   This testimony  is some distance from,  say, a\n\ncredible alibi that only the defendant can supply showing him\n\nto have been elsewhere at the time of the crime.\n\n     As for the  other side of the equation--the  need not to\n\ntestify--we  may  assume  that  honest  testimony  from   the\n\ndefendant on the conspiracy issue would have nailed down that\n\ncharge.   But  (as we  explain below)  the government  needed\n\nlittle help on  this score once the drug  ledgers and related\n\ntestimony  as to Lisa's  connection to them  were considered.\n\nGiven  the  broad  discretion permitted  to  trial  courts in\n\ndeciding severance  questions,  Olivo-Infante,  938  F.2d  at\n                                             \n\n1409, we  think that in this case the denial of severance was\n\nassuredly not an abuse of that discretion.  \n\n     In short, the government  charged Pasquale with  closely\n\nrelated  offenses: drug trafficking, conspiracy, and use of a\n\nfirearm in connection  with trafficking.  If  Pasquale wanted\n\nto testify  on the  firearm charge and  deny the  use of  the\n\nhandguns  in connection with drug trafficking, the nature and\n\nscope of his drug trafficking would normally be a fit subject\n\n                             -7-\n\nfor  cross  examination;  and  it  is  inherent  in  such  an\n\nexamination  that  it  might help  the  government  prove the\n\nconspiracy   charge.    The   Fifth  Amendment  protects  the\n\ndefendant's right to choose whether  to testify.  It does not\n\nassure  that the testimony  will only benefit  the defendant.\n\nMcGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 213 (1971).\n                      \n\n     Turning to Pasquale's other arguments, the second string\n\nto his  bow on  appeal is  a claim  that the  court erred  in\n\nadmitting the drug ledgers.  One set of papers had been found\n\ninside a  stove in  the kitchen;  the other  set  was in  the\n\nliving  room.    They  contained  entries  concerning various\n\ntransactions,  including  amounts and  customer  names.   The\n\ngovernment  not  only  introduced   the  ledgers  but,   over\n\nobjection, offered expert handwriting and print evidence that\n\nassociated both ledgers  in some degree with Lisa  and one of\n\nthem with Hamilton.\n\n     Pasquale's  brief says  that it  was error to  admit the\n\nledgers  because the  government  failed to  offer  evidence,\n\nindependent  of the ledgers,  to show that  they qualified as\n\nco-conspirator  statements   made  in   furtherance  of   the\n\nconspiracy.   Under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E),  a statement\n\navoids  hearsay objections  if  the trial  judge  finds by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that  an out-of-court statement\n\nwas made by  a co-conspirator and was made  in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.  See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171\n                                               \n\n                             -8-\n\n(1987).   It  may lessen  the  confusion that  surrounds drug\n\nledger evidence to point out that what needs to be proved for\n\nadmissibility  depends  upon  the  use  to  be  made  of  the\n\nevidence.\n\n     First,  if records manifestly are or  are shown by other\n\nevidence  to be  drug  records,  they  are  admissible  \"real\n\nevidence\" tending to make it more likely that a drug business\n\nwas being  conducted, see United  States v. Tejada,  886 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n483,  487  (1st  Cir.  1989),  and  for  this  use  there  is\n\nordinarily  no hearsay problem  to be overcome.   Rather, the\n\nrecords  help to  show \"the  character and  use of  the place\n\nwhere the notebooks were found,\" United States v. Wilson, 532\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 641,  645 (8th Cir.  1976), just like drugs,  scales and\n\nguns.  Here, the nature of the ledgers was indicated not only\n\nby the type  of entry--which would have  been sufficient--but\n\nalso  by expert  testimony  from  a DEA  agent  who gave  his\n\nopinion that the records related to drug transactions.3\n\n     Second,  in this  case the  ledgers  served the  further\n\npurpose  of helping to  prove the existence  of a conspiracy.\n\n                    \n\n     3Using the entries to show the character  of the ledgers\nas drug records does, of course, present some of the risks of\nhearsay; but under the  modern definition of hearsay, such  a\nuse does not  render the entries hearsay  because the entries\nare not being used to prove  the truth of the matter asserted\nin the entries (e.g., that a specific transaction  took place\n                    \non a particular date).  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)  (hearsay is\nan  out of court statement offered \"to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted\"); 2 J. Strong,  McCormick on Evidence   250,\n                                                      \nat 112 (1992) (collecting cases).\n\n                             -9-\n\nPasquale's  own involvement in  drugs was established  by his\n\npleas and much  other evidence, but relatively  little direct\n\nevidence in his trial showed active participation by Lisa  in\n\nthe business (her own admissions  to the police were not made\n\nknown to  Pasquale's jury).   Most of  the drugs  and related\n\nitems were found  either in Pasquale's areas of  the house or\n\nin  common areas.   But the  ledgers, once they  were tied to\n\nLisa by handwriting and print evidence, made the inference of\n\nconspiracy easy.  \n\n     Once  again this use of the ledgers presented no hearsay\n\nproblem in this  case.  The \"truth\"  of individual statements\n\nin the ledgers is beside the point; all that matters is  that\n\nthe  ledgers are drug records to which  Lisa may be linked by\n\nother  evidence.   Nor is  there a  hearsay problem  posed by\n\ntestimony from a  handwriting or print expert  that connected\n\nLisa to the ledgers.  Thus, for the most important use of the\n\nledgers in  this case--to help show more than one participant\n\nand thus a  conspiracy--there was no  need for a  preliminary\n\nfinding of  likely conspiracy  nor any need  to satisfy  Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E).\n\n     Third,  when it  made  its  proffer  in support  of  the\n\nledgers, the government reserved the right to use the ledgers\n\nto show not only the fact of conspiracy but also, by  relying\n\non specific entries,   the dimensions  of the conspiracy.  To\n\nthe  extent  that  the  prosecutor wanted  to  argue  that an\n\n                             -10-\n\nindividual entry was \"true\"--say, one showing a specific sale\n\nof a specific amount to  a specific person--then some hearsay\n\nexception or exclusion did need  to be satisfied.  Here, Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E) was  invoked.   In admitting  the evidence,  the\n\ndistrict  court expressly  found by  a  preponderance of  the\n\nevidence  that the  ledgers  were  made  by  conspirators  in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n     These findings  were amply supported by  admissible non-\n\nhearsay  evidence.4   Lisa's  presence  in the  home,  with a\n\nmarijuana  garden in the  cellar and drugs  and paraphernalia\n\nthroughout was highly suggestive.  The notion that \"presence\"\n\nat a crime  does not equal guilt is not a ban on common sense\n\ninferences:   the evidence  of pervasive drug  production and\n\ndealing in  Lisa's home was  material evidence that  made her\n\ninvolvement more plausible.  Once  she was linked to the drug\n\nledgers--a linkage  that  also did  not happen  to depend  on\n\nhearsay--the  trial  judge  could  easily  conclude   that  a\n\nconspiracy had been shown and admit the ledgers for the truth\n\nof the statements contained within them.\n\n                    \n\n     4Actually, Fed.  R. Evid.  104(a) permits  the judge  to\nconsider the hearsay statements for their truth in making the\nadmissibility  findings, see Bourjaily,  483 U.S.  at 178-80,\n                                      \nalthough this  court has  recently joined  other circuits  in\nholding  that there  must  be  some  evidence  of  conspiracy\nindependent  of the  hearsay statements  themselves.   United\n                                                             \nStates v.  Sepulveda, Nos.  92-1362 et al.,  slip op.  at 30,\n                    \n(1st  Cir.,  Dec. 20,  1993).

Sec. 841 (count I);  possession with intent to distribute, id.  (count II);  use of a firearm--namely, the two handguns--during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (count III), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1);  and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846 (count IV).

The first request merely said that Pasquale \"may\" want to testify on the gun count but remain silent on the others and would be prejudiced by joinder of the counts.  The second request said that he did not want to testify on anything other than the gun charge and was entitled to testify on that charge to refute the suggestions that the guns were used in drug trafficking.  This request also pointed to its list of witnesses who would testify for Pasquale concerning his \"use and possession of firearms.\"   The district court denied both requests for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, during jury selection in August 1992, Pasquale filed a motion in limine requesting the court to \"preclude the government or any of the co-defendants' counsel [from eliciting testimony from him] regarding matters outside the scope of his [contemplated direct] testimony.\"   That direct testimony, the motion said, would describe his longtime involvement with firearms, explain his reasons for their possession, and show that they were not for use in drug trafficking.  Pasquale also now pled guilty to the first two counts--manufacture and possession with intent to distribute--and he argued that this further diminished the government's need to cross-examine him about his drug activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the in limine request.  It reaffirmed this denial when the request was renewed at the close of the government's case in chief.  In this renewed request, Pasquale provided further detail as to his proposed testimony, explaining that he would testify that the handguns were purchased and used \"for fun\" and not for drug trafficking.  In a post-trial order, the district court said that it refused to grant the in limine requests because \"a defendant's testimony invites cross examination on topics made relevant by his direct testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were tried together using multiple juries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Pasquale did not testify but did offer witnesses who described his sporting and collector's interest in guns.  On August 31, 1992, the jury convicted Pasquale on counts III and IV--the two counts on which he had not already pled guilty--and he now appeals from those convictions.  Lisa was convicted on counts II and IV and acquitted on the other counts, but died in an automobile accident before sentencing.  Hamilton was convicted of misdemeanor possession and has not appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pasquale's first argument on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motions to sever the gun count from the other counts.  Severance for undue prejudice is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and a refusal to sever will be overturned only for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Olivo-Infante, 938 F.2d 1406, 1409 (1st Cir.1991).  Further, a refusal to sever related counts, naming the same defendant, may be the least likely candidate for appellate reversal.  Still, Pasquale's counsel--who appears to have played a weak hand with skill and foresight--has built a case somewhat stronger than the usual general claim of potential confusion or \"spillover\" effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Pasquale has sought shelter in a doctrine, developed elsewhere but cited approvingly in this circuit, that a defendant may deserve a severance of counts where the defendant makes \"a convincing showing that 'he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and strong need to refrain from testifying on the other.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This in turn requires a defendant to offer in timely fashion \"enough information\" so that the court can weigh \"the considerations of judicial economy\" against the defendant's \"freedom to choose whether to testify\" as to a particular charge.  Scivola, 766 F.2d at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be doubtful whether, prior to trial, Pasquale explained his position in adequate detail;  his first motion was bland and conditional and even his second was sparse.  See United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1283 (1st Cir.1993).  Still, the second request suggested that Pasquale wanted to testify in order to deny that the guns were used for drug trafficking--a rather simple proposition.  As for not testifying on other counts, Pasquale has never explained exactly what he feared.  But we prefer to treat the case as if Pasquale had said what we think is apparent:  that the government had overwhelming proof against him on counts I and II but little direct proof of conspiracy, and he did not wish to help it to close this gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Pasquale had said all this plainly and at the outset, we think that the denial of the severance would still have to be sustained.  The limited case law on Scivola-type motions does not greatly illuminate the question just how \"important\" must be the defendant's proffered testimony or what kind of \"strong\" reasons explain the need not to testify on other counts.  But obvious considerations of judicial economy support trying all related counts against the same defendant at one time.  And while the courts zealously guard a defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify at all, the case law is less protective of a defendant's right to testify selectively, addressing some issues while withholding testimony on others that are related.  See Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148, 155-56, 78 S.Ct. 622, 627, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case do not argue strongly for a severance.  Pasquale's testimony that the hand guns were \"for fun\" might have been of some help to him, although his general \"gun enthusiast\" story was presented through other witnesses.  Even if he had testified, it is still unclear (no proffer was made) how he could have explained the fact that one or both of the guns were apparently loaded, one--found under his bed--was a semi-automatic pistol and the other--found in a drawer near the front door--was a high-powered .357 magnum.  This testimony is some distance from, say, a credible alibi that only the defendant can supply showing him to have been elsewhere at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the other side of the equation--the need not to testify--we may assume that honest testimony from the defendant on the conspiracy issue would have nailed down that charge.  But (as we explain below) the government needed little help on this score once the drug ledgers and related testimony as to Lisa's connection to them were considered.  Given the broad discretion permitted to trial courts in deciding severance questions, Olivo-Infante, 938 F.2d at 1409, we think that in this case the denial of severance was assuredly not an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the government charged Pasquale with closely related offenses:  drug trafficking, conspiracy, and use of a firearm in connection with trafficking.  If Pasquale wanted to testify on the firearm charge and deny the use of the handguns in connection with drug trafficking, the nature and scope of his drug trafficking would normally be a fit subject for cross examination;  and it is inherent in such an examination that it might help the government prove the conspiracy charge.  The Fifth Amendment protects the defendant's right to choose whether to testify.  It does not assure that the testimony will only benefit the defendant.  McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 213, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1470, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to Pasquale's other arguments, the second string to his bow on appeal is a claim that the court erred in admitting the drug ledgers.  One set of papers had been found inside a stove in the kitchen;  the other set was in the living room.  They contained entries concerning various transactions, including amounts and customer names.  The government not only introduced the ledgers but, over objection, offered expert handwriting and print evidence that associated both ledgers in some degree with Lisa and one of them with Hamilton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pasquale's brief says that it was error to admit the ledgers because the government failed to offer evidence, independent of the ledgers, to show that they qualified as co-conspirator statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), a statement avoids hearsay objections if the trial judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an out-of-court statement was made by a co-conspirator and was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987).  It may lessen the confusion that surrounds drug ledger evidence to point out that what needs to be proved for admissibility depends upon the use to be made of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, if records manifestly are or are shown by other evidence to be drug records, they are admissible \"real evidence\" tending to make it more likely that a drug business was being conducted, see United States v.  Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 487 (1st Cir.1989), and for this use there is ordinarily no hearsay problem to be overcome.  Rather, the records help to show \"the character and use of the place where the notebooks were found,\"  United States v. Wilson, 532 F.2d 641, 645 (8th Cir.1976), just like drugs, scales and guns.  Here, the nature of the ledgers was indicated not only by the type of entry--which would have been sufficient--but also by expert testimony from a DEA agent who gave his opinion that the records related to drug transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in this case the ledgers served the further purpose of helping to prove the existence of a conspiracy.  Pasquale's own involvement in drugs was established by his pleas and much other evidence, but relatively little direct evidence in his trial showed active participation by Lisa in the business (her own admissions to the police were not made known to Pasquale's jury).  Most of the drugs and related items were found either in Pasquale's areas of the house or in common areas.  But the ledgers, once they were tied to Lisa by handwriting and print evidence, made the inference of conspiracy easy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again this use of the ledgers presented no hearsay problem in this case.  The \"truth\" of individual statements in the ledgers is beside the point;  all that matters is that the ledgers are drug records to which Lisa may be linked by other evidence.  Nor is there a hearsay problem posed by testimony from a handwriting or print expert that connected Lisa to the ledgers.  Thus, for the most important use of the ledgers in this case--to help show more than one participant and thus a conspiracy--there was no need for a preliminary finding of likely conspiracy nor any need to satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, when it made its proffer in support of the ledgers, the government reserved the right to use the ledgers to show not only the fact of conspiracy but also, by relying on specific entries, the dimensions of the conspiracy.  To the extent that the prosecutor wanted to argue that an individual entry was \"true\"--say, one showing a specific sale of a specific amount to a specific person--then some hearsay exception or exclusion did need to be satisfied.  Here, Rule 801(d)(2)(E) was invoked.  In admitting the evidence, the district court expressly found by a preponderance of the evidence that the ledgers were made by conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings were amply supported by admissible non-hearsay evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lisa's presence in the home, with a marijuana garden in the cellar and drugs and paraphernalia throughout was highly suggestive.  The notion that \"presence\" at a crime does not equal guilt is not a ban on common sense inferences:  the evidence of pervasive drug production and dealing in Lisa's home was material evidence that made her involvement more plausible.  Once she was linked to the drug ledgers--a linkage that also did not happen to depend on hearsay--the trial judge could easily conclude that a conspiracy had been shown and admit the ledgers for the truth of the statements contained within them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the evidence of joint drug dealing by husband and wife satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E)--which requires only a probability or likelihood of conspiracy--but the evidence amply satisfied the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for conviction.  Although Pasquale purports to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of conspiracy, we think that this is not a serious argument and requires no further discussion.  Other claims of error have been considered but need no separate comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to trial Lisa made a number of admissions to the authorities concerning the Alosas' drug sources, and she decoded various of the transaction entries in the ledgers.

Scivola, 766 F.2d at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be doubtful whether, prior to trial, Pasquale explained his position in adequate detail;  his first motion was bland and conditional and even his second was sparse.  See United States v. Tracy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603771\"><a href=\"/opinion/603771/united-states-v-john-l-tracy-united-states-of-america-v-john-l-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span>, 1283 (1st Cir.1993).  Still, the second request suggested that Pasquale wanted to testify in order to deny that the guns were used for drug trafficking--a rather simple proposition.  As for not testifying on other counts, Pasquale has never explained exactly what he feared.  But we prefer to treat the case as if Pasquale had said what we think is apparent:  that the government had overwhelming proof against him on counts I and II but little direct proof of conspiracy, and he did not wish to help it to close this gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Pasquale had said all this plainly and at the outset, we think that the denial of the severance would still have to be sustained.  The limited case law on Scivola-type motions does not greatly illuminate the question just how \"important\" must be the defendant's proffered testimony or what kind of \"strong\" reasons explain the need not to testify on other counts.  But obvious considerations of judicial economy support trying all related counts against the same defendant at one time.  And while the courts zealously guard a defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify at all, the case law is less protective of a defendant's right to testify selectively, addressing some issues while withholding testimony on others that are related.  See Brown v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105661\"><a href=\"/opinion/105661/brown-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105661\"><a href=\"/opinion/105661/brown-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 627, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105661\"><a href=\"/opinion/105661/brown-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span> (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case do not argue strongly for a severance.  Pasquale's testimony that the hand guns were \"for fun\" might have been of some help to him, although his general \"gun enthusiast\" story was presented through other witnesses.  Even if he had testified, it is still unclear (no proffer was made) how he could have explained the fact that one or both of the guns were apparently loaded, one--found under his bed--was a semi-automatic pistol and the other--found in a drawer near the front door--was a high-powered .357 magnum.  This testimony is some distance from, say, a credible alibi that only the defendant can supply showing him to have been elsewhere at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the other side of the equation--the need not to testify--we may assume that honest testimony from the defendant on the conspiracy issue would have nailed down that charge.  But (as we explain below) the government needed little help on this score once the drug ledgers and related testimony as to Lisa's connection to them were considered.  Given the broad discretion permitted to trial courts in deciding severance questions, Olivo-Infante, 938 F.2d at 1409, we think that in this case the denial of severance was assuredly not an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the government charged Pasquale with closely related offenses:  drug trafficking, conspiracy, and use of a firearm in connection with trafficking.  If Pasquale wanted to testify on the firearm charge and deny the use of the handguns in connection with drug trafficking, the nature and scope of his drug trafficking would normally be a fit subject for cross examination;  and it is inherent in such an examination that it might help the government prove the conspiracy charge.  The Fifth Amendment protects the defendant's right to choose whether to testify.  It does not assure that the testimony will only benefit the defendant.  McGautha v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108329\"><a href=\"/opinion/108329/mcgautha-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 213, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108329\"><a href=\"/opinion/108329/mcgautha-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span> (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to Pasquale's other arguments, the second string to his bow on appeal is a claim that the court erred in admitting the drug ledgers.  One set of papers had been found inside a stove in the kitchen;  the other set was in the living room.  They contained entries concerning various transactions, including amounts and customer names.  The government not only introduced the ledgers but, over objection, offered expert handwriting and print evidence that associated both ledgers in some degree with Lisa and one of them with Hamilton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pasquale's brief says that it was error to admit the ledgers because the government failed to offer evidence, independent of the ledgers, to show that they qualified as co-conspirator statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), a statement avoids hearsay objections if the trial judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an out-of-court statement was made by a co-conspirator and was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See Bourjaily v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2775</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1987).  It may lessen the confusion that surrounds drug ledger evidence to point out that what needs to be proved for admissibility depends upon the use to be made of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, if records manifestly are or are shown by other evidence to be drug records, they are admissible \"real evidence\" tending to make it more likely that a drug business was being conducted, see United States v.  Tejada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529942\"><a href=\"/opinion/529942/united-states-v-alberto-tejada-united-states-of-america-v-juan-ignacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 487 (1st Cir.1989), and for this use there is ordinarily no hearsay problem to be overcome.  Rather, the records help to show \"the character and use of the place where the notebooks were found,\"  United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334185\"><a href=\"/opinion/334185/united-states-v-isreal-wilson-aka-junior-wilson-aka-big-man-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 645 (8th Cir.1976), just like drugs, scales and guns.  Here, the nature of the ledgers was indicated not only by the type of entry--which would have been sufficient--but also by expert testimony from a DEA agent who gave his opinion that the records related to drug transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in this case the ledgers served the further purpose of helping to prove the existence of a conspiracy.  Pasquale's own involvement in drugs was established by his pleas and much other evidence, but relatively little direct evidence in his trial showed active participation by Lisa in the business (her own admissions to the police were not made known to Pasquale's jury).  Most of the drugs and related items were found either in Pasquale's areas of the house or in common areas.  But the ledgers, once they were tied to Lisa by handwriting and print evidence, made the inference of conspiracy easy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again this use of the ledgers presented no hearsay problem in this case.  The \"truth\" of individual statements in the ledgers is beside the point;  all that matters is that the ledgers are drug records to which Lisa may be linked by other evidence.  Nor is there a hearsay problem posed by testimony from a handwriting or print expert that connected Lisa to the ledgers.  Thus, for the most important use of the ledgers in this case--to help show more than one participant and thus a conspiracy--there was no need for a preliminary finding of likely conspiracy nor any need to satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, when it made its proffer in support of the ledgers, the government reserved the right to use the ledgers to show not only the fact of conspiracy but also, by relying on specific entries, the dimensions of the conspiracy.  To the extent that the prosecutor wanted to argue that an individual entry was \"true\"--say, one showing a specific sale of a specific amount to a specific person--then some hearsay exception or exclusion did need to be satisfied.  Here, Rule 801(d)(2)(E) was invoked.  In admitting the evidence, the district court expressly found by a preponderance of the evidence that the ledgers were made by conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings were amply supported by admissible non-hearsay evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lisa's presence in the home, with a marijuana garden in the cellar and drugs and paraphernalia throughout was highly suggestive.  The notion that \"presence\" at a crime does not equal guilt is not a ban on common sense inferences:  the evidence of pervasive drug production and dealing in Lisa's home was material evidence that made her involvement more plausible.  Once she was linked to the drug ledgers--a linkage that also did not happen to depend on hearsay--the trial judge could easily conclude that a conspiracy had been shown and admit the ledgers for the truth of the statements contained within them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the evidence of joint drug dealing by husband and wife satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E)--which requires only a probability or likelihood of conspiracy--but the evidence amply satisfied the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for conviction.  Although Pasquale purports to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of conspiracy, we think that this is not a serious argument and requires no further discussion.  Other claims of error have been considered but need no separate comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to trial Lisa made a number of admissions to the authorities concerning the Alosas' drug sources, and she decoded various of the transaction entries in the ledgers.
