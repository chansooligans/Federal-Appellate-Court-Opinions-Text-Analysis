Appellant David Yeadon appeals the grant of\n               \n\na motion  for summary  judgment in favor  of appellee,  Pizza\n\nHut,  in  regard  to  Yeadon's   claim  that  Pizza  Hut  was\n\nvicariously liable for damages incurred by him in an accident\n\ncaused by Dwight Spaulding,  an employee of Pizza Hut.   This\n\ndiversity  action  is  governed  by Massachusetts  law.    We\n\nsummarily affirm.\n\n                              I\n\n     In  April  1990, Yeadon  was  injured  in an  automobile\n\naccident  when a  vehicle driven  by Spaulding  collided with\n\nYeadon's car.   At the  time of the  accident, Spaulding  was\n\nacting within the scope of his employment with Pizza Hut.  In\n\nMarch 1991, Yeadon, in  return for a payment of  $15,000 from\n\nSpaulding's  insurance  carrier,  Arbella   Mutual  Insurance\n\nCompany, executed a release which reads as follows:\n\n     In consideration of  FIFTEEN THOUSAND  ($15,000.00)\n     dollars to be paid  by ARBELLA MUTUAL INSURANCE CO.\n     the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged I hereby\n     remise,  release and  forever  discharge  the  said\n     Arbella Mutual and Dwight  J. Spaulding of and from\n     all  debts,  demands,  actions,  causes  of action,\n     suits, accounts,  covenants, contracts, agreements,\n     damages,  and  any  and  all  claims,  demands  and\n     liabilities  whatsoever of  every name  and nature,\n     both  in LAW and in  EQUITY, which against the said\n     Dwight J. Spaulding or his  heirs and assigns I now\n     have or ever had from the beginning of the world to\n     this date  and more  especially on account  of [an]\n     automobile  accident   on  April  11,  1990.    The\n     undersigned  specifically  reserves  all rights  as\n     against Pizza  Hut and  Dwight J. Spaulding  as its\n     agent.  \n\n                             -2-\n\nThe  release  was  signed  by  Yeadon and  witnessed  by  his\n\nattorney.      In March  1993,  Yeadon brought  suit  against\n\nPizza Hut, on the  ground that it was vicariously  liable for\n\nthe damages from the accident.  The district court found that\n\nYeadon  had released  Spaulding from  all liability  and that\n\nunder  Massachusetts law the release of  an agent precluded a\n\nderivative claim against the  principal.  The court therefore\n\ngranted Pizza Hut's motion for summary judgment.  \n\n                              II\n\n     Yeadon raises two arguments  on appeal. First, he argues\n\nthat  the district court erred in interpreting the March 1991\n\ncontract  as an  unambiguous  release of  Spaulding from  all\n\nliability.  Second, he contends that, even if the contract is\n\nso interpreted, Massachusetts law does not bar a claim in his\n\ncase.\n\n     Yeadon  asserts  that  his  intent  in  the  March  1991\n\ncontract was to grant  an absolute release to Arbella  but to\n\ngrant only a qualified release to Spaulding and to preserve a\n\ncomplete  right  of  action against  Pizza  Hut.   He  relies\n\nprimarily  upon the explicit  language of the  release to the\n\neffect that  he \"specifically reserves all  rights as against\n\nPizza Hut  and Dwight J.  Spaulding as  its agent.\"   He also\n\nseeks   to  support  his   interpretation  by   reference  to\n\ncircumstances surrounding the agreement.   Since, in spite of\n\nthe language referred to by appellant, we find the release to\n\n                             -3-\n\nbe \"unambiguous in  regard to the  question at hand,\"  Hermes\n                                                             \n\nAutomation Technology, Co. v. Hyundai Electronics Industries,\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  915 F.2d 739, 747 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing cases), i.e.,\n                                                           \n\nits  grant  of a  complete  release to  Spaulding,  we eschew\n\nreliance on external evidence  and limit our consideration to\n\nthe plain  meaning  of  the  language of  the  contract,  see\n                                                             \n\nCommercial Union Ins Co.  v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 7  F.3d 1047,\n                                             \n\n1052-53 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying Massachusetts law). \n\n     With the  exception of the last sentence, the March 1991\n\ncontract is a standard preprinted release form filled in with\n\nthe information relevant  to the accident of April  11, 1990.\n\nThe  form is entitled as a  \"Release from All Demand\" and its\n\nlanguage grants a complete release from all liability for the\n\naccident  to  \"Arbella  Mutual   and  Dwight  J.  Spaulding.\"\n                                                           \n\n(emphasis added).   The  only possible qualification  to this\n\nunqualified  release is  the  last sentence  of the  contract\n\nwhich  purports to \"reserve  all rights as  against Pizza Hut\n\nand  Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.\"  Unless this sentence\n\ncan  be  read  as   a  retraction  of  the   release  granted\n\nimmediately above,  it must  mean that appellant  intended to\n\npreserve his right of action against Pizza Hut and to reserve\n\na  right against Spaulding only as a means for reaching Pizza\n\nHut.   However,  if Pizza  Hut were  to be  found vicariously\n\nliable  for any  damages  to Yeadon  due  to the  actions  of\n\n\"Spaulding as its  agent,\" Pizza  Hut would have  a right  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nseek indemnity from  Spaulding.  See  Elias v. Unisys  Corp.,\n                                                           \n\n410 Mass. 479, 483, 573  N.E.2d 946, 949 (1991).   The effect\n\nof  the reference  to Spaulding  in the  final sentence  then\n\nwould be to  subject him  to liability for  the damages  from\n\nwhich  the  contract purports  to  release  him.   Spaulding,\n\ntherefore,  would have  paid,  through  his insurer,  $15,000\n\ncompensation without having acquired complete protection from\n\nfurther liability.  Rather than reading the  last sentence as\n\na negation of the  complete release plainly granted Spaulding\n\nin the remainder of  the document, we find that,  read in the\n\nlight of  the contract  as a whole,  see Cullen  Enterprises,\n                                                             \n\nInc. v. Massachusetts Property  Ins. Underwriting Ass'n,  399\n                                                       \n\nMass. 886, 900, 507 N.E.2d 717, 725 (1987) (\"contract must be\n\ninterpreted  as  a  whole  to  give  effect  to  its  general\n\npurpose\"), the  last sentence preserves a  right only against\n\nPizza Hut and  has no effect on the release of Spaulding from\n\nfurther liability. \n\n     Interpreting the contract  as an unqualified  release of\n\nSpaulding  from all  liability stemming  from the  April 1990\n\naccident,  we  further  find   that  Massachusetts  law  bars\n\nrecovery against Pizza Hut.   In facts analogous to  those of\n\nthis case, the Supreme Judicial Court held that \"the  release\n\nof  an agent precludes a  claim against his  principal who is\n\nliable solely on the theory of respondeat superior.\"   Elias,\n                                                            \n\n410 Mass.  at 484,  573 N.E.2d  at 949.   Yeadon  attempts to\n\n                             -5-\n\ndistinguish  Elias  first on  the  ground that  in  Elias the\n                                                         \n\nplaintiff  had granted  the agent  a general  release whereas\n\nYeadon explicitly reserved his right against Pizza Hut.  This\n\nargument is unavailing since, according to Elias, the release\n                                                \n\nof  Spaulding barred, as a  matter of law,  any claim against\n\nPizza Hut.  Therefore,  the attempt by Yeadon to  reserve his\n\nrights against Pizza Hut was legally meaningless.  \n\n     Yeadon also asserts that the \"essence\" of  Elias is that\n                                                     \n\nan injured party be \"fully compensate[d for] an injury caused\n\nby  the act of a single tortfeasor.\"   Id. at 483, 573 N.E.2d\n                                         \n\nat  948 (citation omitted).   Inasmuch as  Yeadon now alleges\n\nthat he  did not receive  full compensation for  his injuries\n\nfrom  Spaulding,  he claims  that  Elias allows  him  to seek\n                                        \n\nfurther compensation directly from Pizza Hut.    \n\n     According to the rules of vicarious liability, \"[i]f the\n\nultimately responsible  agent  is unavailable  or  lacks  the\n\nability to pay, the innocent victim has  recourse against the\n\nprincipal.\"   Id.  However,  in the instant  case, Spaulding,\n                \n\nthrough his insurer,  had the  ability to  pay $15,000  which\n\nYeadon  accepted as  the price  of a  release.   According to\n\nElias, in  a situation where  \"the agent .  . . has  means to\n     \n\npay, invocation  of the doctrine [of  vicarious liability] is\n\nunnecessary because the  injured party has a  fund from which\n\nto recover.\"   Id.  We find nothing in  Elias, nor has Yeadon\n                                             \n\ncalled  our  attention to  anything,  which  would limit  the\n\n                             -6-\n\neffect  of  an  agent's   release  to  situations  where  the\n\nplaintiff  concedes  after the  fact  to  having been  \"fully\n\ncompensated.\"     Having  granted  Spaulding   a  release  in\n\nconsideration of $15,000 compensation, Yeadon has no recourse\n\nunder   Massachusetts  law   against   Pizza   Hut   in   the\n\ncircumstances at bar.1\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n1.  Of course,  this does  not mean  that the  reservation of\nrights was a nullity  or otherwise illusory.  It  sufficed to\npreserve claims  against Pizza Hut for direct  (as opposed to\n                                             \nvicarious)  liability,  e.g.,  if  Pizza  Hut  had  furnished\n                            \nSpaulding   with  a   defective  vehicle,   and   the  defect\ncontributed  to  the occurrence  of  the accident.    By like\ntoken, the  reservation sufficed  to preserve  claims against\nPizza Hut  arising out of different  accidents or occurrences\n(not involving Spaulding).\n\n                             -7-\n",

This diversity action is governed by Massachusetts law.  We summarily affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In April 1990, Yeadon was injured in an automobile accident when a vehicle driven by Spaulding collided with Yeadon's car.  At the time of the accident, Spaulding was acting within the scope of his employment with Pizza Hut.  In March 1991, Yeadon, in return for a payment of $15,000 from Spaulding's insurance carrier, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company, executed a release which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In consideration of FIFTEEN THOUSAND ($15,000.00) dollars to be paid by ARBELLA MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged I hereby remise, release and forever discharge the said Arbella Mutual and Dwight J. Spaulding of and from all debts, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, damages, and any and all claims, demands and liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in LAW and in EQUITY, which against the said Dwight J. Spaulding or his heirs and assigns I now have or ever had from the beginning of the world to this date and more especially on account of [an] automobile accident on April 11, 1990.  The undersigned specifically reserves all rights as against Pizza Hut and Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The release was signed by Yeadon and witnessed by his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1993, Yeadon brought suit against Pizza Hut, on the ground that it was vicariously liable for the damages from the accident.  The district court found that Yeadon had released Spaulding from all liability and that under Massachusetts law the release of an agent precluded a derivative claim against the principal.  The court therefore granted Pizza Hut's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeadon raises two arguments on appeal.  First, he argues that the district court erred in interpreting the March 1991 contract as an unambiguous release of Spaulding from all liability.

He relies primarily upon the explicit language of the release to the effect that he \"specifically reserves all rights as against Pizza Hut and Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.\"  He also seeks to support his interpretation by reference to circumstances surrounding the agreement.  Since, in spite of the language referred to by appellant, we find the release to be \"unambiguous in regard to the question at hand,\" Hermes Automation Technology, Co. v.  Hyundai Electronics Industries, Co., 915 F.2d 739, 747 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing cases), i.e., its grant of a complete release to Spaulding, we eschew reliance on external evidence and limit our consideration to the plain meaning of the language of the contract, see Commercial Union Ins Co. v.  Walbrook Ins. Co., 7 F.3d 1047, 1052-53 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying Massachusetts law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the exception of the last sentence, the March 1991 contract is a standard preprinted release form filled in with the information relevant to the accident of April 11, 1990.

However, if Pizza Hut were to be found vicariously liable for any damages to Yeadon due to the actions of \"Spaulding as its agent,\" Pizza Hut would have a right to seek indemnity from Spaulding.  See  Elias v. Unisys Corp., 410 Mass. 479, 483, 573 N.E.2d 946, 949 (1991).  The effect of the reference to Spaulding in the final sentence then would be to subject him to liability for the damages from which the contract purports to release him.  Spaulding, therefore, would have paid, through his insurer, $15,000 compensation without having acquired complete protection from further liability.  Rather than reading the last sentence as a negation of the complete release plainly granted Spaulding in the remainder of the document, we find that, read in the light of the contract as a whole,  see Cullen Enterprises, Inc. v. Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass'n, 399 Mass. 886, 900, 507 N.E.2d 717, 725 (1987) (\"contract must be interpreted as a whole to give effect to its general purpose\"), the last sentence preserves a right only against Pizza Hut and has no effect on the release of Spaulding from further liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting the contract as an unqualified release of Spaulding from all liability stemming from the April 1990 accident, we further find that Massachusetts law bars recovery against Pizza Hut.

This diversity action is governed by Massachusetts law.  We summarily affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In April 1990, Yeadon was injured in an automobile accident when a vehicle driven by Spaulding collided with Yeadon's car.  At the time of the accident, Spaulding was acting within the scope of his employment with Pizza Hut.  In March 1991, Yeadon, in return for a payment of $15,000 from Spaulding's insurance carrier, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company, executed a release which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In consideration of FIFTEEN THOUSAND ($15,000.00) dollars to be paid by ARBELLA MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged I hereby remise, release and forever discharge the said Arbella Mutual and Dwight J. Spaulding of and from all debts, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, damages, and any and all claims, demands and liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in LAW and in EQUITY, which against the said Dwight J. Spaulding or his heirs and assigns I now have or ever had from the beginning of the world to this date and more especially on account of [an] automobile accident on April 11, 1990.  The undersigned specifically reserves all rights as against Pizza Hut and Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The release was signed by Yeadon and witnessed by his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1993, Yeadon brought suit against Pizza Hut, on the ground that it was vicariously liable for the damages from the accident.  The district court found that Yeadon had released Spaulding from all liability and that under Massachusetts law the release of an agent precluded a derivative claim against the principal.  The court therefore granted Pizza Hut's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeadon raises two arguments on appeal.  First, he argues that the district court erred in interpreting the March 1991 contract as an unambiguous release of Spaulding from all liability.  Second, he contends that, even if the contract is so interpreted, Massachusetts law does not bar a claim in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeadon asserts that his intent in the March 1991 contract was to grant an absolute release to Arbella but to grant only a qualified release to Spaulding and to preserve a complete right of action against Pizza Hut.  He relies primarily upon the explicit language of the release to the effect that he \"specifically reserves all rights as against Pizza Hut and Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.\"  He also seeks to support his interpretation by reference to circumstances surrounding the agreement.  Since, in spite of the language referred to by appellant, we find the release to be \"unambiguous in regard to the question at hand,\" Hermes Automation Technology, Co. v.  Hyundai Electronics Industries, Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548926\"><a href=\"/opinion/548926/hermes-automation-technology-inc-v-hyundai-electronics-industries-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 747 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing cases), i.e., its grant of a complete release to Spaulding, we eschew reliance on external evidence and limit our consideration to the plain meaning of the language of the contract, see Commercial Union Ins Co. v.  Walbrook Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655503\"><a href=\"/opinion/655503/commercial-union-insurance-co-v-walbrook-insurance-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1052-53 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying Massachusetts law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the exception of the last sentence, the March 1991 contract is a standard preprinted release form filled in with the information relevant to the accident of April 11, 1990.  The form is entitled as a \"Release from All Demand\" and its language grants a complete release from all liability for the accident to \"Arbella Mutual and Dwight J. Spaulding.\"  (emphasis added).  The only possible qualification to this unqualified release is the last sentence of the contract which purports to \"reserve all rights as against Pizza Hut and Dwight J. Spaulding as its agent.\"  Unless this sentence can be read as a retraction of the release granted immediately above, it must mean that appellant intended to preserve his right of action against Pizza Hut and to reserve a right against Spaulding only as a means for reaching Pizza Hut.  However, if Pizza Hut were to be found vicariously liable for any damages to Yeadon due to the actions of \"Spaulding as its agent,\" Pizza Hut would have a right to seek indemnity from Spaulding.  See  Elias v. Unisys Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068227\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068227/elias-v-unisys-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 483, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068227\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068227/elias-v-unisys-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 949 (1991).  The effect of the reference to Spaulding in the final sentence then would be to subject him to liability for the damages from which the contract purports to release him.  Spaulding, therefore, would have paid, through his insurer, $15,000 compensation without having acquired complete protection from further liability.  Rather than reading the last sentence as a negation of the complete release plainly granted Spaulding in the remainder of the document, we find that, read in the light of the contract as a whole,  see Cullen Enterprises, Inc. v. Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043932/cullen-enterprises-v-mass-property-ins-under-assoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 900, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043932/cullen-enterprises-v-mass-property-ins-under-assoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 725 (1987) (\"contract must be interpreted as a whole to give effect to its general purpose\"), the last sentence preserves a right only against Pizza Hut and has no effect on the release of Spaulding from further liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting the contract as an unqualified release of Spaulding from all liability stemming from the April 1990 accident, we further find that Massachusetts law bars recovery against Pizza Hut.  In facts analogous to those of this case, the Supreme Judicial Court held that \"the release of an agent precludes a claim against his principal who is liable solely on the theory of respondeat superior.\"   Elias, 410 Mass. at 484, 573 N.E.2d at 949.  Yeadon attempts to distinguish Elias first on the ground that in Elias the plaintiff had granted the agent a general release whereas Yeadon explicitly reserved his right against Pizza Hut.  This argument is unavailing since, according to Elias, the release of Spaulding barred, as a matter of law, any claim against Pizza Hut.  Therefore, the attempt by Yeadon to reserve his rights against Pizza Hut was legally meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yeadon also asserts that the \"essence\" of Elias is that an injured party be \"fully compensate[d for] an injury caused by the act of a single tortfeasor.\"   Id. at 483, 573 N.E.2d at 948 (citation omitted).  Inasmuch as Yeadon now alleges that he did not receive full compensation for his injuries from Spaulding, he claims that Elias allows him to seek further compensation directly from Pizza Hut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the rules of vicarious liability, \"[i]f the ultimately responsible agent is unavailable or lacks the ability to pay, the innocent victim has recourse against the principal.\"  Id. However, in the instant case, Spaulding, through his insurer, had the ability to pay $15,000 which Yeadon accepted as the price of a release.  According to Elias, in a situation where \"the agent ... has means to pay, invocation of the doctrine [of vicarious liability] is unnecessary because the injured party has a fund from which to recover.\"  Id. We find nothing in Elias, nor has Yeadon called our attention to anything, which would limit the effect of an agent's release to situations where the plaintiff concedes after the fact to having been \"fully compensated.\"  Having granted Spaulding a release in consideration of $15,000 compensation, Yeadon has no recourse under Massachusetts law against Pizza Hut in the circumstances at bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
