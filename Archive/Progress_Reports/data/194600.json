This  is   a\n                                            \n\nSentencing  Guidelines  appeal, in  which defendant-appellant\n\nSantos  Olea  contends that  the  sentencing  court erred  by\n\nconsidering  as relevant  conduct quantities of  cocaine from\n\nsales to which  he did  not plead guilty,  by increasing  his\n\nsentence for  an obstruction of  justice, and by  denying his\n\nrequest   to   reduce   the  sentence   for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.  We affirm the sentence.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Santos Olea  was indicted  in January 1992  on four\n\ncounts: Count I charged  that on December 12, 1991,  Olea and\n\ncodefendant Alberto Gonzalez distributed cocaine in violation\n\nof 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1); Counts II and III charged that the\n\nsame  occurred on December 16 and December 20, 1991; Count IV\n\ncharged that  from a time  unknown until  December 20,  1991,\n\nOlea   and  Gonzalez  conspired   to  distribute  cocaine  in\n\nviolation of 21  U.S.C.   846.   Olea  pleaded guilty in  the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\nto Count I  in return  for the dismissal  of the three  other\n\ncounts.1\n\n          At sentencing  in September  1992, the  court heard\n\ntestimony  from  Detective Gannon  of  the  Providence Police\n\nDepartment,  who presented  his view  of Olea's  role in  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Codefendant  Gonzalez,  who  is  not a  party  here,  was\nindicted  on the same four  counts and pleaded  guilty to the\nfirst three.\n\n                             -2-\n\nthree sales.   A  government informant, \"Luis,\"  arranged for\n\nGannon  to  make  an  undercover  purchase  of  cocaine  from\n\ncodefendants Olea  and Gonzalez at a  shopping center parking\n\nlot in Providence. \n\nOn  December 12,  1991, at  11:30 a.m.,  Olea drove  into the\n\nparking  lot with Gonzalez in the  passenger seat, where they\n\nmet with Detective  Gannon inside the  car.  Luis  introduced\n\ndefendant  Santos Olea  as \"Hector\"  and Alberto  Gonzalez as\n\n\"Jose.\"   Gonzalez  handed  a package  of  cocaine to  Gannon\n\n(weighing approximately  60 grams).   Both Olea  and Gonzalez\n\ntold him  to check it  out.   Gannon gave Gonzalez  $1,450 in\n\ncash,  who counted it and handed  it to Olea who also counted\n\nit.   When Gannon said he would want more cocaine later, Olea\n\nsaid that Gannon could contact him through informant Luis.\n\n          On December  16, 1991,  Gannon called Luis,  who in\n\nturn  called \"Hector,\" and the three men spoke on a three-way\n\ntelephone  line   with  Luis  acting   as  a  Spanish-English\n\ninterpreter.   Gannon said to Hector that he wanted \"the same\n\nthing,\"  to which Hector replied, \"I'm busy today.  I'll send\n\nmy  nephew.\"  Hector also said, \"Same place, same price, same\n\nquantity.\"    Gannon testified  that  the  voice of  \"Hector\"\n\nsounded like the voice of defendant-appellant Olea, and that,\n\nin  his opinion, he was speaking  with Olea.  Later that day,\n\ncodefendant Gonzalez arrived alone at the same parking lot at\n\nthe same time in the same  car, which was registered to Olea.\n\n                             -3-\n\nGonzalez delivered 60.7  grams of cocaine  to Gannon for  the\n\nsame price.  Gonzalez then gave Gannon a phone number to call\n\nfor more cocaine.  The number  was listed to the same address\n\nwhere Olea and Gonzalez  apparently lived and were eventually\n\narrested.\n\n          Three more times in the next few days, Gannon spoke\n\nto  \"Hector\" on  the telephone  in the  same manner:   Gannon\n\ncalled Luis, who in turn established a three-way conversation\n\nwith \"Hector.\"   Luis later  told Gannon that  he established\n\nthe phone contact with  \"Hector\" by dialing the  phone number\n\ngiven  to  Gannon by  Gonzalez.   On  the third  call, Gannon\n\narranged for  a purchase of  double the previous  quantity of\n\ncocaine.  Hector  told Gannon that  his \"nephew\" would  again\n\ndeliver it at the same place.  On December 20, Gonzalez again\n\ncame  to  the parking  lot in  Olea's  car and  completed the\n\ntransaction  for 123.65 grams.  The total weight of the three\n\nsales was  245.20 grams.   Police subsequently  arrested Olea\n\nand Gonzalez  at the  address where  the  telephone line  was\n\nregistered.\n\n          Prior  to sentencing,  Olea wrote  a letter  to the\n\ncourt apologizing for his involvement in the December 12 drug\n\nsale,  to  which  he  had  pleaded  guilty.    However,  Olea\n\nproclaimed  that  he  merely  gave Gonzalez  a  ride  to  the\n\nshopping center  on December 12,  never touched the  money or\n\ndrugs, and  had  nothing  else to  do  with  Gonzalez's  drug\n\n                             -4-\n\ndealing.  Olea also strenuously denied any connection with or\n\nknowledge  of the December 16 and December 20 sales, claiming\n\nthat Gonzalez  merely borrowed  his car without  telling Olea\n\nwhat   he  was  doing.    The  letter  was  included  in  the\n\npresentence report.\n\n          After  hearing  the   evidence  at  the  sentencing\n\nhearing and  considering Olea's letter and  objections to the\n\npresentence  report, the  court  sentenced Olea.   The  court\n\njudged Detective  Gannon to  be a  credible  witness, and  so\n\nfound  that  the  \"Hector\"  on  the  telephone  was  actually\n\ndefendant Olea and that Olea had actively participated in all\n\nthree drug sales.   Based upon the evidence, the  court found\n\nthat  the entire amount of cocaine in the three sales, 245.20\n\ngrams,  should  be  considered  in  calculating  Olea's  base\n\noffense  level.  The court  also found that  Olea's letter to\n\nthe court contained material falsehoods regarding his role in\n\nthe transactions.  After  denying any downward adjustment for\n\na  minor role in the offense, increasing the offense level by\n\ntwo points pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 for obstruction  of\n\njustice, and denying a  two-point reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, the  court calculated\n\nthe offense level as  22.  With criminal history  category I,\n\nthe applicable sentencing  range was  41 to 51  months.   The\n\ncourt sentenced  defendant to  42 months incarceration  and 5\n\nyears supervised  release, along  with other fines  and other\n\n                             -5-\n\nconditions  not  relevant  here.     Olea  appeals  from  his\n\nsentence.\n\n                             -6-\n\n                             II.\n\n          Appellant contends that the sentencing  court erred\n\nin  three particulars:  (1) it  included as  relevant conduct\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   1B1.3 the quantities of cocaine involved  in\n\nthe  December 16  and December  20 sales;  (2) it  found that\n\nappellant obstructed justice under  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1; and (3)\n\nit denied appellant a reduction in sentence for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.2   All of appellant's\n\nthree  arguments turn on the extent of his involvement in the\n\nthree cocaine sales.\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the court made a factual\n\nfinding  that  appellant was  an  active  participant in  the\n\nDecember 12  sale, and was not  a mere driver  as he claimed.\n\nThe court also found that appellant arranged for the December\n\n16 and  20 sales,  even though codefendant  Gonzalez actually\n\ndelivered the drugs to the parking lot.  The court's findings\n\nrested  in large part  on the testimony  of Detective Gannon,\n\nwhom the court found to be a credible witness.  Assessment of\n\nthe  credibility  of  witnesses is  for  the  trier of  fact.\n\nUnited States  v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1989).  We\n                         \n\nmust accept these findings  unless clearly erroneous.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Gerante, 891 F.2d 364, 368 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                 \n\n                    \n\n2.  All references to the United States Sentencing Guidelines\nare  to the November 1,  1991, version, which  is the version\napplicable to appellant's case.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          We  do  not find  clear  error.   Detective  Gannon\n\ntestified  that,  on  December  12, he  met  with  appellant,\n\nidentified as \"Hector,\" and  that appellant spoke with Gannon\n\nabout the quality of the cocaine, counted the money, and told\n\nGannon to contact him  through Luis if he wanted  more drugs.\n\nGannon arranged for each  of the two later sales  by speaking\n\non  the  telephone  to  someone  who  answered  to  the  name\n\n\"Hector.\"   Each  call took  place in  the same  manner, with\n\nGannon  calling Luis,  who  in turn  established a  three-way\n\nconference  call with  \"Hector\" by  dialing the  phone number\n\nsupplied  to Gannon by Gonzalez.  Gannon recognized the voice\n\nof  \"Hector\" each time as  that of appellant  Olea.  \"Hector\"\n\ntold Gannon  to meet his \"nephew\" at the \"same place.\"  After\n\nsuch  phone calls,  the  later two  sales  took place,  under\n\ncircumstances quite  similar to  the first sale,  with Olea's\n\ncodefendant similarly involved, using  Olea's car.  The court\n\nwas  under   no  obligation   to  accept  Olea's   denial  of\n\ninvolvement, which it could have found implausible in all the\n\ncircumstances. \n\n          We turn next to the district court's application of\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a),3  concerning  relevant conduct.   In  a\n\n                    \n\n3.  Section 1B1.3(a) provides:\n\n          Unless otherwise specified, (i)  the base\n          offense   level   where   the   guideline\n          specifies  more  than  one  base  offense\n          level,     (ii)      specific     offense\n          characteristics    and    (iii)     cross\n\n                             -8-\n\ndrug distribution case, quantities  of drugs not specified in\n\nthe count of conviction are to be included in determining the\n\noffense  level if  they  were part  of  the same  \"course  of\n\nconduct  or part of a common scheme  or plan\" as the count of\n\nconviction.   U.S.S.G.    1B1.3  comment.  (backg'd.); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. DiIorio, 948 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1991).  We believe\n                 \n\nthat  the court  reasonably concluded,  based on  its finding\n\nthat appellant had participated in all three drug sales, that\n\nthe relevant amount of cocaine here was the total amount sold\n\nin   the  three   separate   transactions,  the   later   two\n\ntransactions being  relevant even  though  appellant did  not\n\nactually  appear in  person  at the  delivery  of the  drugs.\n\nDiIorio, 948 F.2d at 7.  Finding no clear error, Gerante, 891\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 368,  we thus  reject appellant's  challenge to  the\n\ncourt's determination of the relevant conduct.\n\n                    \n\n          references  in  Chapter  Two,   and  (iv)\n          adjustments  in  Chapter Three,  shall be\n          determined on the basis of the following:\n          . . .\n               (2)  solely with respect to offenses\n                    of  a  character  for  which   \n                    3D1.2(d)  [Groups   of  Closely\n                    Related  Counts] would  require\n                    grouping  of  multiple  counts,\n                    all    acts    and    omissions\n                    described    in    subdivisions\n                    (1)(A)  and  (1)(B) above  that\n                    were part of the same course of\n                    conduct  or  common  scheme  or\n                    plan   as    the   offense   of\n                    conviction; \n          . . . .\n\n                             -9-\n\n          Appellant  also  challenges   the  obstruction   of\n\njustice  enhancement  under  U.S.S.G.      3C1.1.    Such  an\n\nenhancement  is  authorized,  inter  alia,  when  a defendant\n                                         \n\nprovides  \"materially  false   information  to  a   judge  or\n\nmagistrate\"  or  \"to a  probation  officer  in respect  to  a\n\npresentence or other investigation  for the court.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n   3C1.1,  comment.  (n.3(f),  (h)).    The  enhancement  was\n\nproperly applied  here as appellant was  supportably found to\n\nhave misrepresented two material  facts in his letter to  the\n\ndistrict court  (which also  was considered by  the probation\n\nofficer  in  preparing the  presentence  report): he  falsely\n\nportrayed  himself  as  \"an  unwitting  dupe\"  (the  district\n\ncourt's words) in  the December 12  sale, and falsely  stated\n\nthat he had nothing whatsoever to do with the December 16 and\n\n20 sales.  Cf.  United States v. Dunnigan, 61  U.S.L.W. 4180,\n                                         \n\n4183, 1993 U.S.  LEXIS 1779 (U.S.  Feb. 23, 1993)  (upholding\n\nobstruction  of  justice  enhancement  under     3C1.1  where\n\ndefendant committed  perjury  at  trial);  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nAkitoye,  923  F.2d  221,   228-29  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (same;\n       \n\ndefendant falsely  denied any  knowledge of drug  dealing and\n\ncharacterized  codefendant \"as  the villain  of the  piece\").\n\nWhile  the  counts  charging   these  later  two  sales  were\n\ndismissed in connection  with Olea's plea to  Count I, Olea's\n\nfalse assertions  that he had  not participated in  them were\n\n\"material\" for the  purposes of U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 because they\n\n                             -10-\n\n\"would tend to  influence or affect\"  the calculation of  his\n\nbase offense level for his conviction on Count I.  U.S.S.G.  \n\n3C1.1, comment.  (n.5).   The sentencing  court did  not err,\n\ntherefore,  in adding a two-level enhancement for obstruction\n\nof justice.\n\n          Finally, we  turn to  appellant's challenge  to the\n\ncourt's refusal to grant  a two-level decrease for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.   Appellant contends that  he was entitled\n\nto such a decrease because he pleaded guilty to and expressed\n\nsome  remorse for his crime  under Count I.   But a reduction\n\nfor  acceptance of responsibility is not \"a matter of right.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1, comment.  (n.3); United States  v. O'Neil,\n                                                            \n\n936  F.2d 599, 599 (1st Cir. 1991).  Except in \"extraordinary\n\ncases,\" \"[c]onduct resulting in  an enhancement under   3C1.1\n\n(Obstructing  or  Impeding  the  Administration  of  Justice)\n\nordinarily indicates  that  the defendant  has  not  accepted\n\nresponsibility for his criminal conduct . .  . .\"  U.S.S.G.  \n\n3E1.1, comment. (n.4); United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64,\n                                               \n\n69  (1st   Cir.  1991).    The   district  court  justifiably\n\ndetermined that this was not the extraordinary case.  \n\n          Appellant  argues that  the  court improperly  gave\n\nweight to  his statements denying any  responsibility for the\n\ntwo  later drug  sales  that were  charged  in the  dismissed\n\ncounts.   It is true that, under our precedent, appellant was\n\nnot required to have shown remorse for the dismissed charges.\n\n                             -11-\n\nUnited States v.  Perez-Franco, 873 F.2d  455, 463 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1989)  (\"[A] defendant  who has  made  a plea  agreement must\n\naccept responsibility  solely for the  counts to which  he is\n\npleading  guilty.\");  see  also  O'Neil,  936  F.2d  at  599.\n                                       \n\nHowever,  the district court did  not base its  denial of the\n\nacceptance of responsibility decrease solely upon defendant's\n\nstatements relative to  the dismissed charges.  It noted that\n\nhe had also lied in  asserting that he had only a  minor role\n\nin the December 12  sale.  His refusal to  accept appropriate\n\nresponsibility  for that  sale,  to which  he pleaded,  alone\n\nwarranted a  finding that  he did not  accept responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the  court's supported  finding that appellant  had\n\nlied  when denying  involvement in the  two later  sales took\n\nappellant  well beyond  the Perez-Franco  safe harbor,  which\n                                        \n\nallows  a  defendant  to  remain  silent  as  to the  conduct\n\ncontained  in  a dismissed  charge  but does  not  sanction a\n\ndefendant's  giving of materially  false information relative\n\n                             -12-\n\nthereto.4  There was no error in the court's  refusal to find\n\nthat Olea had accepted responsibility.\n\n                             III.\n\n          Finding  no error  in  any of  the court's  rulings\n\nbelow, we affirm appellant's sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.  \n                  \n\n                    \n\n4.  While this  proceeding is  not controlled by  the current\nApplication  Note  1(a)  to  section  3E1.1,  that  note  now\narticulates the  distinction we make.  It reads, in pertinent\npart:\n\n          Note  that a defendant is not required to\n          volunteer,   or    affirmatively   admit,\n          relevant  conduct  beyond the  offense of\n          conviction in order to obtain a reduction\n          under  subsection (a).   A  defendant may\n          remain  silent  in  respect  to  relevant\n          conduct beyond the offense  of conviction\n          without affecting his ability to obtain a\n          reduction    under    this    subsection.\n          However, a defendant who  falsely denies,\n          or frivolously contests, relevant conduct\n          that the court determines  to be true has\n          acted  in  a  manner   inconsistent  with\n          acceptance of responsibility[.]\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1,  comment. (n.1(a))  (as amended,  effective\nNov.  1, 1992).  The  district court here  indicated that had\ndefendant  said nothing  about  the later  sales, instead  of\nfalsely denying all involvement,  it would have been prepared\nto  grant  the  decrease  for  acceptance  of  responsibility\n(assuming truthfulness as to Count I). \n\n                             -13-\n",

This  is   a\n                                            \n\nSentencing  Guidelines  appeal, in  which defendant-appellant\n\nSantos  Olea  contends that  the  sentencing  court erred  by\n\nconsidering  as relevant  conduct quantities of  cocaine from\n\nsales to which  he did  not plead guilty,  by increasing  his\n\nsentence for  an obstruction of  justice, and by  denying his\n\nrequest   to   reduce   the  sentence   for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.  We affirm the sentence.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Santos Olea  was indicted  in January 1992  on four\n\ncounts: Count I charged  that on December 12, 1991,  Olea and\n\ncodefendant Alberto Gonzalez distributed cocaine in violation\n\nof 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1); Counts II and III charged that the\n\nsame  occurred on December 16 and December 20, 1991; Count IV\n\ncharged that  from a time  unknown until  December 20,  1991,\n\nOlea   and  Gonzalez  conspired   to  distribute  cocaine  in\n\nviolation of 21  U.S.C.   846.   Olea  pleaded guilty in  the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\nto Count I  in return  for the dismissal  of the three  other\n\ncounts.1\n\n          At sentencing  in September  1992, the  court heard\n\ntestimony  from  Detective Gannon  of  the  Providence Police\n\nDepartment,  who presented  his view  of Olea's  role in  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Codefendant  Gonzalez,  who  is  not a  party  here,  was\nindicted  on the same four  counts and pleaded  guilty to the\nfirst three.\n\n                             -2-\n\nthree sales.   A  government informant, \"Luis,\"  arranged for\n\nGannon  to  make  an  undercover  purchase  of  cocaine  from\n\ncodefendants Olea  and Gonzalez at a  shopping center parking\n\nlot in Providence. \n\nOn  December 12,  1991, at  11:30 a.m.,  Olea drove  into the\n\nparking  lot with Gonzalez in the  passenger seat, where they\n\nmet with Detective  Gannon inside the  car.  Luis  introduced\n\ndefendant  Santos Olea  as \"Hector\"  and Alberto  Gonzalez as\n\n\"Jose.\"   Gonzalez  handed  a package  of  cocaine to  Gannon\n\n(weighing approximately  60 grams).   Both Olea  and Gonzalez\n\ntold him  to check it  out.   Gannon gave Gonzalez  $1,450 in\n\ncash,  who counted it and handed  it to Olea who also counted\n\nit.   When Gannon said he would want more cocaine later, Olea\n\nsaid that Gannon could contact him through informant Luis.\n\n          On December  16, 1991,  Gannon called Luis,  who in\n\nturn  called \"Hector,\" and the three men spoke on a three-way\n\ntelephone  line   with  Luis  acting   as  a  Spanish-English\n\ninterpreter.   Gannon said to Hector that he wanted \"the same\n\nthing,\"  to which Hector replied, \"I'm busy today.  I'll send\n\nmy  nephew.\"  Hector also said, \"Same place, same price, same\n\nquantity.\"    Gannon testified  that  the  voice of  \"Hector\"\n\nsounded like the voice of defendant-appellant Olea, and that,\n\nin  his opinion, he was speaking  with Olea.  Later that day,\n\ncodefendant Gonzalez arrived alone at the same parking lot at\n\nthe same time in the same  car, which was registered to Olea.\n\n                             -3-\n\nGonzalez delivered 60.7  grams of cocaine  to Gannon for  the\n\nsame price.  Gonzalez then gave Gannon a phone number to call\n\nfor more cocaine.  The number  was listed to the same address\n\nwhere Olea and Gonzalez  apparently lived and were eventually\n\narrested.\n\n          Three more times in the next few days, Gannon spoke\n\nto  \"Hector\" on  the telephone  in the  same manner:   Gannon\n\ncalled Luis, who in turn established a three-way conversation\n\nwith \"Hector.\"   Luis later  told Gannon that  he established\n\nthe phone contact with  \"Hector\" by dialing the  phone number\n\ngiven  to  Gannon by  Gonzalez.   On  the third  call, Gannon\n\narranged for  a purchase of  double the previous  quantity of\n\ncocaine.  Hector  told Gannon that  his \"nephew\" would  again\n\ndeliver it at the same place.  On December 20, Gonzalez again\n\ncame  to  the parking  lot in  Olea's  car and  completed the\n\ntransaction  for 123.65 grams.  The total weight of the three\n\nsales was  245.20 grams.   Police subsequently  arrested Olea\n\nand Gonzalez  at the  address where  the  telephone line  was\n\nregistered.\n\n          Prior  to sentencing,  Olea wrote  a letter  to the\n\ncourt apologizing for his involvement in the December 12 drug\n\nsale,  to  which  he  had  pleaded  guilty.    However,  Olea\n\nproclaimed  that  he  merely  gave Gonzalez  a  ride  to  the\n\nshopping center  on December 12,  never touched the  money or\n\ndrugs, and  had  nothing  else to  do  with  Gonzalez's  drug\n\n                             -4-\n\ndealing.  Olea also strenuously denied any connection with or\n\nknowledge  of the December 16 and December 20 sales, claiming\n\nthat Gonzalez  merely borrowed  his car without  telling Olea\n\nwhat   he  was  doing.    The  letter  was  included  in  the\n\npresentence report.\n\n          After  hearing  the   evidence  at  the  sentencing\n\nhearing and  considering Olea's letter and  objections to the\n\npresentence  report, the  court  sentenced Olea.   The  court\n\njudged Detective  Gannon to  be a  credible  witness, and  so\n\nfound  that  the  \"Hector\"  on  the  telephone  was  actually\n\ndefendant Olea and that Olea had actively participated in all\n\nthree drug sales.   Based upon the evidence, the  court found\n\nthat  the entire amount of cocaine in the three sales, 245.20\n\ngrams,  should  be  considered  in  calculating  Olea's  base\n\noffense  level.  The court  also found that  Olea's letter to\n\nthe court contained material falsehoods regarding his role in\n\nthe transactions.  After  denying any downward adjustment for\n\na  minor role in the offense, increasing the offense level by\n\ntwo points pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 for obstruction  of\n\njustice, and denying a  two-point reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, the  court calculated\n\nthe offense level as  22.  With criminal history  category I,\n\nthe applicable sentencing  range was  41 to 51  months.   The\n\ncourt sentenced  defendant to  42 months incarceration  and 5\n\nyears supervised  release, along  with other fines  and other\n\n                             -5-\n\nconditions  not  relevant  here.     Olea  appeals  from  his\n\nsentence.\n\n                             -6-\n\n                             II.\n\n          Appellant contends that the sentencing  court erred\n\nin  three particulars:  (1) it  included as  relevant conduct\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   1B1.3 the quantities of cocaine involved  in\n\nthe  December 16  and December  20 sales;  (2) it  found that\n\nappellant obstructed justice under  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1; and (3)\n\nit denied appellant a reduction in sentence for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.2   All of appellant's\n\nthree  arguments turn on the extent of his involvement in the\n\nthree cocaine sales.\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the court made a factual\n\nfinding  that  appellant was  an  active  participant in  the\n\nDecember 12  sale, and was not  a mere driver  as he claimed.\n\nThe court also found that appellant arranged for the December\n\n16 and  20 sales,  even though codefendant  Gonzalez actually\n\ndelivered the drugs to the parking lot.  The court's findings\n\nrested  in large part  on the testimony  of Detective Gannon,\n\nwhom the court found to be a credible witness.  Assessment of\n\nthe  credibility  of  witnesses is  for  the  trier of  fact.\n\nUnited States  v.

Detective  Gannon\n\ntestified  that,  on  December  12, he  met  with  appellant,\n\nidentified as \"Hector,\" and  that appellant spoke with Gannon\n\nabout the quality of the cocaine, counted the money, and told\n\nGannon to contact him  through Luis if he wanted  more drugs.\n\nGannon arranged for each  of the two later sales  by speaking\n\non  the  telephone  to  someone  who  answered  to  the  name\n\n\"Hector.\"   Each  call took  place in  the same  manner, with\n\nGannon  calling Luis,  who  in turn  established a  three-way\n\nconference  call with  \"Hector\" by  dialing the  phone number\n\nsupplied  to Gannon by Gonzalez.  Gannon recognized the voice\n\nof  \"Hector\" each time as  that of appellant  Olea.  \"Hector\"\n\ntold Gannon  to meet his \"nephew\" at the \"same place.\"  After\n\nsuch  phone calls,  the  later two  sales  took place,  under\n\ncircumstances quite  similar to  the first sale,  with Olea's\n\ncodefendant similarly involved, using  Olea's car.  The court\n\nwas  under   no  obligation   to  accept  Olea's   denial  of\n\ninvolvement, which it could have found implausible in all the\n\ncircumstances. \n\n          We turn next to the district court's application of\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a),3  concerning  relevant conduct.   In  a\n\n                    \n\n3.

We believe\n                 \n\nthat  the court  reasonably concluded,  based on  its finding\n\nthat appellant had participated in all three drug sales, that\n\nthe relevant amount of cocaine here was the total amount sold\n\nin   the  three   separate   transactions,  the   later   two\n\ntransactions being  relevant even  though  appellant did  not\n\nactually  appear in  person  at the  delivery  of the  drugs.\n\nDiIorio, 948 F.2d at 7.

Such  an\n\nenhancement  is  authorized,  inter  alia,  when  a defendant\n                                         \n\nprovides  \"materially  false   information  to  a   judge  or\n\nmagistrate\"  or  \"to a  probation  officer  in respect  to  a\n\npresentence or other investigation  for the court.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n   3C1.1,  comment.  (n.3(f),  (h)).
