Appellant  Surfact,  Inc.,  a   Florida\n                \n\ncorporation, appeals  the  dismissal for  lack  of  diversity\n\njurisdiction  of its  action  against appellee,  South  Pearl\n\nChemical, Inc.  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n\n     On February 1, 1988,  appellant Surfact, entered into an\n\nexclusive  dealership  agreement with  South  Pearl Chemical,\n\nInc.   According  to appellant,  the agreement  was illegally\n\nterminated on January 31,  1990, in violation of Puerto  Rico\n\nLaw 75,  10 L.P.R.A.    278.  Appellant  brought suit in  the\n\nUnited  States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nand invoked  diversity jurisdiction  pursuant to 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1332.   Appellee  in  turn  moved  to  dismiss  for  lack  of\n\ndiversity.     A  magistrate   judge  issued  a   report  and\n\nrecommendation  that  the  motion  for dismissal  be  granted\n\nbecause  both   parties   to  the   agreement  were   Florida\n\ncorporations.  The district court affirmed.  \n\n                              II\n\n          The dispute in  this case  arises out  of the  fact\n\nthat  there have been  two corporations with  the name \"South\n\nPearl Chemical,  Inc.\"   One corporation [South  Pearl Puerto\n\nRico] was incorporated in 1984 in the Commonwealth of  Puerto\n\nRico.  South Pearl Puerto  Rico amended its corporate charter\n\nin July  1987 to change its corporate name to Ole South Pearl\n\nChemical, Inc.   The other corporation  [South Pearl Florida]\n\n                             -2-\n\nwas incorporated  in 1987 in  the state of  Florida.   In May\n\n1987,  Ole  South  Pearl  transferred  all  its  \"assets  and\n\nbusiness\" to South  Pearl Florida in exchange  for 800 shares\n\nof  South   Pearl  Florida  common  stock.1     However,  the\n\ncorporations  remained  separate  entities.    The  exclusive\n\ndealership   agreement  between   Surfact  and   South  Pearl\n\nChemical,  Inc. was entered into  almost ten months after the\n\ntransfer  of assets between  Ole South Pearl  and South Pearl\n\nFlorida.   \n\n          Surfact asserts that it entered into the  exclusive\n\ndealership  agreement with  Ole  South Pearl.   The  district\n\ncourt, however,  found that the exclusive dealership contract\n\nhad  been entered  into by Surfact  and South  Pearl Florida.\n\nHence, diversity of  parties was absent.   We review findings\n\nof jurisdictional  facts only for  clear error.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nMarshall County Bd.  of Educ. v.  Marshall County Gas  Dist.,\n                                                           \n\n992 F.2d  1171,  1178 (11th  Cir. 1993);  Rocovich v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. Cir. 1991).\n      \n\n          The district  court's finding is supportable in the\n\nrecord.   Prior to  the signing of  the exclusive  dealership\n\nagreement, all  Ole South Pearl's \"assets  and business\" were\n\ntransferred  to South  Pearl Florida.   From this,  the court\n\ncould  have  inferred that,  at  the  time of  the  exclusive\n\n                    \n\n1.  The transfer agreement, dated May 31, 1987, refers to Old\nSouth Pearl, Inc., even though the amendment to the corporate\ncharter changing the name was not filed until July 24, 1987.\n\n                             -3-\n\ndealership agreement, South Pearl Florida was the only active\n\ncorporation  and thus the  only one which  would have entered\n\ninto the agreement with Surfact.  This inference is confirmed\n\nnot  only by  the fact that,  by the  time of  the agreement,\n\nSouth Pearl Puerto  Rico had  changed its name  to Old  South\n\nPearl,  but also by tax  records, which show  that, after the\n\ntransfer  of  assets,  South  Pearl  Florida  was  an  active\n\ncorporation  with net sales  of over  $1,600,000 in  1988 and\n\n$4,000,000 in 1989,  whereas there  is no record  of any  tax\n\nreports  having  been filed  by Ole  South Pearl  after 1987.\n\nFinally, Heraclio Prieto, who  signed the agreement on behalf\n\nof  South  Pearl  Chemical,  Inc., filed  a  sworn  affidavit\n\nstating that he  did so  as a representative  of South  Pearl\n\nFlorida.       Although  other evidence  in the  record might\n\nsupport a  contrary finding, the district  court's finding is\n\nnot  clearly erroneous.   See  Lundquist v.  Precision Valley\n                                                             \n\nAviation,  Inc., 946  F.2d 8,  11 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (no clear\n              \n\nerror  where factfinder chooses between two permissible views\n\nof the evidence).2 \n\n                    \n\n2.  Appellant also contends that  the district court erred in\ndismissing  the case  before  granting appellant  an adequate\nopportunity to  conduct discovery  relevant to the  motion to\ndismiss.   However, this objection was not  raised before the\nmagistrate  judge  or   in  appellant's   objection  to   the\nrecommendation  and  report of  the  magistrate  judge.   It,\ntherefore, cannot be raised before this  court. See Borden v.\n                                                          \nSecretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n1987) (argument which  could have been but was  not presented\nto magistrate in first instance is waived on review).\n\n                             -4-\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -5-\n",
