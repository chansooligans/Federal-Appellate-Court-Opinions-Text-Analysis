Defendant Jorge\n                                         \n\nEliecer Agudelo appeals from his November 29, 1989 conviction\n\nfor possession  with intent  to distribute five  kilograms or\n\nmore of cocaine, 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1), and for conspiracy to\n\ndo the same.  21 U.S.C.   846.  Three co-defendants, Hildardo\n\nAlvarez, Antonio Palacio Calle, and Jorge Ivan Berrio-Londono\n\nwere  also so charged.   The jury convicted  Alvarez, but the\n\ndistrict  court  directed  mistrials  for Calle  and  Berrio-\n\nLondono  after the  jury  failed to  reach  a verdict.1    On\n\nappeal,  Agudelo alleges  that  the court  erred in  allowing\n\nSpecial  Agent Lemon to  testify regarding a  1986 seizure of\n\ncash from the defendant and in allowing him to provide expert\n\nopinion testimony on the same.  We affirm.\n\n          The  story,   taking  it  most  favorably   to  the\n\ngovernment,  United States  v. Echeverri,  982 F.2d  675 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1993),   unfolds   as  follows.      Drug   Enforcement\n\nAdministration  (\"DEA\") agents  learned that  a Lear  jet had\n\nbeen  hired to fly  empty from Detroit  to Boston to  pick up\n\nseveral passengers.  The itinerary called  for a limousine to\n\npick  up the passengers  at room 160 of  a local Holiday Inn,\n\nthe driver to ask  for Steve.  Upon arrival  at Logan Airport\n\nthe  pilot presented the $4,000 rental fee to the agents, and\n\ntheir  trained dog alerted to  a narcotics residue.   The DEA\n\n                    \n\n1.  Calle has since pleaded and Berrio-Londono has been tried\nand convicted.  United States v. Berrio-Londono, 946 F.2d 158\n                                               \n(1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1223 (1992).\n                             \n\n                             -2-\n\nagents  replaced  the  limousine  driver   with  police  Sgt.\n\nTomassi,  who proceeded  to room  160  and knocked.   Agudelo\n\nopened  the door,  and the  three co-defendants  were inside.\n\nWalking down  the corridor to leave, Agudelo  told Alvarez to\n\n\"go get the bag,\" and  Alvarez left by a side exit  while the\n\nothers proceeded to the  limousine outside the main entrance.\n\nOn their reaching  it Agudelo and the other two co-defendants\n\nwere confronted by the agents, and Alvarez was thereafter met\n\ncarrying  a partially  unzipped duffel  bag.  Inside  were 12\n\nkilograms  of cocaine  in  wrapped packages.    Investigation\n\nshowed that the hotel room had been checked into by Calle and\n\nBerrio-Londono at 8  p.m. that  evening.  A  search found  it\n\nempty but for a scrap of paper with Alvarez's phone number.  \n\n          After  his arrest,  Agudelo  told  the police  that\n\nCalle and Berrio-Londono were soccer friends whom he  had not\n\nseen for  years until  a happenstance encounter  earlier that\n\nafternoon.  He added that  he had agreed to meet them  at the\n\nhotel  just to \"say hello and bye-bye.\"  This explanation was\n\ncontradicted by  boarding passes  found on Calle  and Berrio-\n\nLondono for the 6 p.m. Trump shuttle from New York to Boston.\n\nThese were verified by a  Trump Shuttle recordkeeper who also\n\nprovided their validated flight coupons.\n\n          At  trial, DEA Special  Agent Lemon testified, over\n\nobjection, regarding his seizing $50,000 cash from Agudelo in\n\n1986.  Lemon  testified that as  Agudelo was passing  through\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe  airport  security  clearance  area,  Lemon  stopped  and\n\nquestioned  him.  Agudelo  responded that he  carried $500 in\n\ncash,  but, after  a  search, Lemon  found  $50,000 in  small\n\ndenomination bills in his clothing and gym bag.  Agudelo then\n\nclaimed  that he had received the money from a Rafael Sanchez\n\nat  a restaurant,  though he  could not  provide the  name or\n\nlocation  of the restaurant or Sanchez's phone number.  A dog\n\ntrained  in  drug  detection  \"alerted\" to  the  presence  of\n\nunidentified drug traces  on the  money.  It  was seized  and\n\nultimately forfeited  when Agudelo,  even though he  had been\n\ngiven a receipt, failed to apply  for its return.  Again over\n\nobjection, Agent  Lemon testified  that he believed  the cash\n\nwas \"proceeds from a drug transaction.\"  Counsel for  Agudelo\n\ndeclined  the district  court's offer  to provide  a limiting\n\ninstruction.\n\n          To be admissible, evidence of a prior conviction or\n\nother wrongdoing under Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b)2 must survive  a\n\ntwo  part  test.   First, the  past  incident must  have some\n\nrelevance  other than  to show  the defendant's  character or\n\npropensity to  commit the  crime.  United  States v.  Ferrer-\n                                                             \n\nCruz, 899  F.2d 135, 137  (1st Cir. 1990).   Second, even  if\n    \n\n                    \n\n2.    \"Evidence  of  other crimes,  wrongs,  or  acts  is not\nadmissible to prove  the character  of a person  in order  to\nshow action in  conformity therewith.   It  may, however,  be\nadmissible  for  other purposes,  such  as  proof of  motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan,  knowledge, identity,\nor absence or mistake or accident. . . .\"\n\n                             -4-\n\nspecially   relevant,  the   danger   of   prejudice   cannot\n\nsubstantially  outweigh the probative  value of the evidence.\n\nId. at 138; Fed. R. Evid. 403. \n   \n\n          The  special relevance question has arisen numerous\n\ntimes  in relation to a defendant's claim that he was unaware\n\nof drugs stored in a variety of mundane or, hopefully, secret\n\nplaces,  including  defendants'   car  trunk,3  car   floor,4\n\nchecked or carry-on baggage,5 or  under his chicken coop  and\n\nfrozen  dog  food.6   For a  recent  collection of  cases see\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Arias-Montoya, 967 F.2d 708 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                              \n\nIt is true that the circumstances in 1986 and the present are\n\nwidely  different, but,  if the  jury believed  defendant had\n\nbeen in a drug transaction then, this might cast  substantial\n\ndoubt on his  testimony that his exercising  control over the\n\ncommandeered bag was innocent.  United States v. Nickens, 955\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 112, 124 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 108 (1992).\n                                      \n\nThis was not a  case of drugs hidden where a  defendant might\n\nreadily claim  ignorance.  Shedding this  light outweighs any\n\nresulting unfair prejudice.  Correspondingly, if the jury did\n\n                    \n\n3.   E.g., United States v. Arias-Montoya, post.\n                                               \n\n4.   E.g., United States v. Ferrer-Cruz, ante.\n                                             \n\n5.   E.g., United States  v. Nickens, post; United  States v.\n                                                          \nSimon, 842 F.2d 552 (1st Cir. 1988).\n     \n\n6.   United States v. Moccia, 681 F.2d 61 (1st Cir. 1982).\n                            \n\n                             -5-\n\nnot give  an unfavorable interpretation to  the 1986 evidence\n\nit would not have been prejudicial.\n\n          We  reject the  government's  claim that  the  1986\n\nevidence was  admissible simply on the  issue of impeachment,\n\nto contradict defendant's  1989 denial that he  had ever been\n\nfound to have $50,000  on his person.  Fed. R.  Evid. 608(b).\n\nHowever, on the broader  issue, we think the jury  could have\n\nfound that the 1986 incident cast light on defendant's intent\n\nin 1989.  \n\n          This sharpens up, however, defendant's objection to\n\nthe  admission of the  agent's opinion that  the 1986 $50,000\n\n\"was proceeds from a drug transaction.\"  While expert opinion\n\nis, of  course, admissible  on  such an  issue, normally  the\n\nexpert should  have some special qualifications  or knowledge\n\nthat would cause his opinion to add something of value.  Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 702.   Here we see nothing; there  was, for example,\n\nnothing in the trade that he interpreted or illuminated.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v.  Echeverri,  ante, and  cases  cited.   The\n                                   \n\nadmission was error.\n\n          Although  with some hesitation,7  we have concluded\n\nthat  it was not prejudicial.  We agree with defendant that a\n\njury,  if it  finds an  expert credible,  may believe  he had\n\n                    \n\n7.  This is not to  forget our complaint in United  States v.\n                                                          \nWilliams, No.  92-1858 (1st  Cir. 2/12/93), about  giving the\n        \ngovernment two  bites  at  the  apple:    push  for  evidence\nbelieved to be damning, and then say it was meaningless.\n\n                             -6-\n\nspecial  grounds  for  his  opinion.     Here  there  was  no\n\nsuggestion that he had such.  The witness had stated the full\n\nbasis  for his conclusion, which the jury knew, equally:  the\n\ndog's alert, and the  singularly powerful fact that defendant\n\nwas willing to forego asking for the $50,000's return.  Under\n\nthe  circumstances we  regard the  agent's opinion  as merely\n\ncumulative, and adding nothing substantial.\n\n          Finding no prejudicial error, we affirm.\n\n                             -7-\n",

Agudelo  responded that he  carried $500 in\n\ncash,  but, after  a  search, Lemon  found  $50,000 in  small\n\ndenomination bills in his clothing and gym bag.  Agudelo then\n\nclaimed  that he had received the money from a Rafael Sanchez\n\nat  a restaurant,  though he  could not  provide the  name or\n\nlocation  of the restaurant or Sanchez's phone number.  A dog\n\ntrained  in  drug  detection  \"alerted\" to  the  presence  of\n\nunidentified drug traces  on the  money.  It  was seized  and\n\nultimately forfeited  when Agudelo,  even though he  had been\n\ngiven a receipt, failed to apply  for its return.  Again over\n\nobjection, Agent  Lemon testified  that he believed  the cash\n\nwas \"proceeds from a drug transaction.\"  Counsel for  Agudelo\n\ndeclined  the district  court's offer  to provide  a limiting\n\ninstruction.\n\n          To be admissible, evidence of a prior conviction or\n\nother wrongdoing under Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b)2 must survive  a\n\ntwo  part  test.   First, the  past  incident must  have some\n\nrelevance  other than  to show  the defendant's  character or\n\npropensity to  commit the  crime.  United  States v.

Fed. R.  Evid. 608(b).\n\nHowever, on the broader  issue, we think the jury  could have\n\nfound that the 1986 incident cast light on defendant's intent\n\nin 1989.  \n\n          This sharpens up, however, defendant's objection to\n\nthe  admission of the  agent's opinion that  the 1986 $50,000\n\n\"was proceeds from a drug transaction.\"  While expert opinion\n\nis, of  course, admissible  on  such an  issue, normally  the\n\nexpert should  have some special qualifications  or knowledge\n\nthat would cause his opinion to add something of value.  Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 702.   Here we see nothing; there  was, for example,\n\nnothing in the trade that he interpreted or illuminated.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v.  Echeverri,  ante, and  cases  cited.   The\n                                   \n\nadmission was error.\n\n          Although  with some hesitation,7  we have concluded\n\nthat  it was not prejudicial.  We agree with defendant that a\n\njury,  if it  finds an  expert credible,  may believe  he had\n\n                    \n\n7.  This is not to  forget our complaint in United  States v.\n                                                          \nWilliams, No.  92-1858 (1st  Cir. 2/12/93), about  giving the\n        \ngovernment two  bites  at  the  apple:    push  for  evidence\nbelieved to be damning, and then say it was meaningless.\n\n                             -6-\n\nspecial  grounds  for  his  opinion.     Here  there  was  no\n\nsuggestion that he had such.  The witness had stated the full\n\nbasis  for his conclusion, which the jury knew, equally:  the\n\ndog's alert, and the  singularly powerful fact that defendant\n\nwas willing to forego asking for the $50,000's return.  Under\n\nthe  circumstances we  regard the  agent's opinion  as merely\n\ncumulative, and adding nothing substantial.\n\n          Finding no prejudicial error, we affirm.\n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
