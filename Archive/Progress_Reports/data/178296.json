Plaintiff-appellant Angel A.\n\nVega-Colón (\"Vega\") brought suit against his employer, defendant-\n\nappellee Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (\"Wyeth\"). Vega contends that Wyeth\n\ndiscriminated and retaliated against him based on his military\n\nservice in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and\n\nReemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\"USERRA\") and Puerto Rico law.\n\nSee 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4335; 29 LPRA §§ 194-194b.                  The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of Wyeth, and Vega timely\n\nappealed.     After careful consideration, we reverse in part and\n\naffirm in part.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n             We recite the facts in the light most favorable to Vega,\n\nthe non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor.   See Bukuras v. Mueller Group, LLC, 592 F.3d 255, 261 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).    The general facts pertinent to Vega's allegations are\n\nset forth below, and more detailed facts are provided when we\n\nanalyze Vega's individual claims.\n\n             Wyeth is a pharmaceutical company located in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn   2002,   Vega    was   hired    by   Wyeth   as   a   \"packaging   equipment\n\nsupervisor.\"        Vega was also a member of the United States Army\n\nReserve.     During his employment at Wyeth, Vega alternated between\n\nactive and inactive status with the Army.             Specifically, from 2002\n\nto 2004 Vega was active and took various leaves from Wyeth for\n\nmilitary training.         From 2004 to February 2007, Vega went on\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\finactive status and did not leave for any military training.                      In\n\nFebruary 2007, Vega returned to active status and was promoted to\n\ncaptain with the condition that he join a military unit and\n\nparticipate in military exercises.             Vega's Army unit was mobilized\n\nin November 2007 and he has been on military leave since then.\n\n            In April 2006, the position of \"reliability engineer\"\n\nbecame available at Wyeth and Vega applied.                       Vega, along with\n\nseveral other internal candidates, was not hired; an outside\n\ncandidate was hired instead.\n\n            In   February       2007,   Vega    received      a    job   performance\n\nevaluation from Wyeth for his 2006 employment year.                      Per policy,\n\nWyeth    provided    all   of    its    employees     with    an    annual    written\n\nevaluation, which included a rating of between one and five with\n\nfive being the most desirable.               For the years 2003 through 2005,\n\nVega was rated a three or \"solid performer.\"                  For the year 2006,\n\nVega's    rating     declined      to    a     two,   which        signaled   \"needs\n\nimprovement.\"       Vega disagreed with his evaluation and requested\n\nthat Wyeth initiate an investigation, which it did.\n\n            In April 2007, Vega filed a discrimination complaint with\n\nthe United States Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and\n\nTraining Service (\"VETS\"), based on Wyeth's failure to hire him for\n\nthe reliability engineer position.                Finding no merit to Vega's\n\naccusations, VETS denied the complaint; however, the complaint was\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fre-instituted at a later point when Vega presented additional\n\nevidence. Vega eventually voluntarily withdrew the VETS complaint.\n\n          On May 7, 2007, Vega met with Wyeth's employee relations\n\ndirector and site director, though what was discussed at this\n\nmeeting is disputed.1   According to Wyeth, the parties discussed\n\nthe results of the investigation it conducted into Vega's 2006\n\nperformance   evaluation,   in    particular   that   the   investigation\n\nrevealed no discriminatory acts.       Vega denies such a conversation\n\ntook place.   Also according to Wyeth, at this meeting Vega made a\n\nthreatening comment to the effect that Wyeth's site director made\n\nit easy for one to understand why massacres like the one at\n\nVirginia Tech take place.2       Vega has no memory of such a comment.\n\n          It is undisputed that shortly after this meeting Wyeth\n\nrestricted Vega's access to its plant.      Vega, who was out on leave\n\nat the time, learned of this restriction when he attempted to enter\n\nthe plant to drop off his military orders.        Vega was stopped and\n\ninformed by a security guard that he could not enter because\n\nWyeth's computer database listed him as terminated. Wyeth contends\n\nthat Vega was not in fact fired but concedes his access was\n\n\n\n     1\n      As will be discussed more fully, this factual dispute is not\nmaterial.\n     2\n      The reference is to the tragic April 16, 2007 shooting on the\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University campus in\nBlacksburg, Virginia where thirty-two members of the faculty and\nstudent body were killed by a lone gunman, while multiple others\nwere injured.\n\n                                    -4-\n\frestricted because of security concerns over his comment about the\n\nVirginia Tech massacre. Notably, Vega never received a termination\n\nletter and he continued to receive a salary and benefits.\n\n          At some point, Vega returned from leave with his access\n\nto the plant restored.   Then in July 2007, Vega was placed on a\n\n\"performance improvement plan\" (\"PIP\").     Per Wyeth policy, all\n\nemployees who received a performance evaluation rating of two or\n\nlower were placed on a PIP.    The PIP established objectives for\n\nVega to complete within ninety days, which he timely completed.\n\nThat November, Vega was informed that although he had completed the\n\nPIP's objectives, the PIP would be extended for other reasons until\n\nhe returned from military service.   Vega's Army unit was mobilized\n\nthat month.3\n\n          Around the same time, Vega instituted the underlying\n\naction alleging past and continuing discriminatory and retaliatory\n\nconduct. Particularly, he claims Wyeth took the following improper\n\nactions: (1) failing to hire him for the reliability engineer\n\nposition; (2) awarding him a low performance rating; (3) extending\n\nthe PIP; (4) discharging and then reinstating him; (5) allowing a\n\nhostile work environment; and (6) retaliating against him for\n\nfiling the VETS complaint. Wyeth moved for summary judgment on all\n\n\n\n     3\n      Vega was scheduled to return to work in February 2010.\nBecause the lower court proceedings took place prior to this time,\nit is uncertain whether Vega has returned from military leave and\nre-assumed his position at Wyeth.\n\n                               -5-\n\fof these claims, and shortly before trial its motion was granted.\n\nFinal   judgment   was   entered    in   Wyeth's   favor   and   Vega   timely\n\nappealed.\n\n                         II. Standard of Review\n\n            This court reviews a district court's grant of summary\n\njudgement de novo. Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 447 F.3d\n\n79, 83 (1st Cir. 2006).     If there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we\n\naffirm.     Id.; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). \"In order to\n\novercome a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must\n\nput forth specific facts to support the conclusion that a triable\n\nissue subsists.\"    Martínez-Rodríguez v. Guevara, 597 F.3d 414, 419\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).    On each issue on which the non-moving party has\n\nthe burden of proof, \"that party must present definite, competent\n\nevidence to rebut the motion.\" Id. (internal citation omitted).\n\n\"Summary judgment for the defendant[] is appropriate when the\n\nevidence is so one-sided that no reasonable person could find in\n\nfavor of the plaintiff.\" Kosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207,\n\n211 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                             III. Discussion\n\n                                   A. USERRA\n\n            The purpose of USERRA is to encourage non-career military\n\nservice, minimize disruption based on this service, and prevent\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdiscrimination against service members. 38 U.S.C. § 4301. To this\n\nend, USERRA provides that:\n\n    A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of,\n    performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an\n    obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall\n    not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention\n    in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by\n    an employer on the basis of that membership, application\n    for membership, performance of service, application for\n    service, or obligation.\n\n38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).    It further provides that an employer \"may not\n\ndiscriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment\n\naction against any person because such person . . . has taken an\n\naction to enforce a protection afforded\" under USERRA.       38 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4311(b).   The term \"uniformed service\" means in pertinent part\n\nthe Armed Forces when engaged in active duty for training.            38\n\nU.S.C. § 4303(16).\n\n          Vega   contends    that   the   alleged   discriminatory   and\n\nretaliatory actions taken by Wyeth were the result of his decision\n\nto return to active duty with the Army, which he ultimately did in\n\nFebruary 2007.   Wyeth urges that because Vega did not return to\n\nactive duty until February 2007, he was not protected under USERRA\n\nuntil this date.       Vega counters that the applicable date was\n\nFebruary 2006, which is the month he was selected for the position\n\nof Army captain with the condition that he return to active status\n\nand also the month he informed one of his supervisors that he would\n\nbe returning to active status.      The district court disagreed with\n\nboth parties' contentions.     It found that because USERRA protects\n\n                                    -7-\n\findividuals who apply for active duty; the applicable date of\n\ncoverage was when Vega informed his supervisors at Wyeth that he\n\nintended to apply to join an active military unit.         Based on this\n\nreasoning, the court found November 2006 to be the applicable date.\n\n           The initial inquiry for this court is what protected\n\nstatus and/or conduct served as the basis for Wyeth's allegedly\n\nimproper actions.     Vega claims that Wyeth's actions stemmed from\n\nhis decision to apply for active duty and his resulting military\n\nservice.     Thus Vega's application to perform service and his\n\nsubsequent membership in a uniformed service are the respective\n\nconduct and status at issue.       See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).\n\n           The next question is when did the protected conduct and\n\nstatus occur.     It is undisputed that Vega returned to active duty\n\nin February 2007 and thus became a member of a \"uniformed service\"\n\nfor purposes of USERRA.          See 38 U.S.C. § 4303(16).      The more\n\ndifficult question is when did Vega \"appl[y] to perform\" active\n\nduty service for purposes of USERRA.         Id.   Construing the record\n\ncarefully,   we    find   that    Vega's   notification   to   his   Wyeth\n\nsupervisors that he was returning to active duty constituted such\n\nan application.     While informing a supervisor of one's intent to\n\nreturn to service is not strictly speaking an application for\n\nservice; it is only logical that USERRA coverage would be triggered\n\nat the point in time in which an employer has information about an\n\nemployee on which it could base discriminatory treatment.            Here\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fVega expressed a definite intent to return to active duty in the\n\nnear future.      To deny an employee who has expressed such a definite\n\nintention the protection of USERRA until his literal application\n\nfor service is signed and delivered would be contrary to the stated\n\npurposes of USERRA.       See 38 U.S.C. § 4301.        This conclusion is\n\nfurther supported by the principle that USERRA should be broadly\n\nconstrued in favor of military service members as its purpose is to\n\nprotect such members. See Hill v. Michelin North America, Inc., 252\n\nF.3d 307, 312-13 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing Coffy v. Republic Steel\n\nCorp., 447 U.S. 191, 196 (1980)(construing USERRA's predecessor\n\nliberally in favor of military members)); see also Gordon v. Wawa,\n\nInc., 388 F.3d 78, 81 (3rd Cir. 2004).\n\n            Thus, the final question is when did Vega inform his\n\nsupervisors that he was returning to active duty.           As noted above,\n\nthe district court found this date to be November 2006.                     We\n\ndisagree. In November 2006, Vega did inform two of his supervisors\n\nthat   he   was   accepted   into   a    military   unit   and   would   start\n\nperforming drills.       However, Vega testified at deposition that\n\nearlier, in February 2006, shortly after receiving his invitation\n\nfrom the Army to become a captain, he informed his supervisor\n\nJohnny Figueroa (\"Figueroa\") that he was returning to active status\n\nand there was a high possibility he would be mobilized.            Wyeth has\n\nnot disputed this statement.        Therefore, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to Vega, February 2006 is the date on\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fwhich he informed his supervisors of a definite intent to return to\n\nactive duty, thus triggering USERRA.4         Because Vega's April 2006\n\napplication for the reliability engineer position was the earliest\n\naction related to his claims, any alleged improper conduct by Wyeth\n\nnecessarily took place after USERRA was triggered.\n\n            Now we turn to the merits, particularly whether Vega's\n\napplication for service and his resulting military service formed\n\nthe basis for any of Wyeth's allegedly improper actions.                 In\n\nassessing a USERRA claim, the burden is on Vega to make an initial\n\nshowing that his military status \"was at least a motivating or\n\nsubstantial factor in [Wyeth's] action.\"                Velázquez-García v.\n\nHorizon Lines of Puerto Rico, Inc., 473 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(internal citation omitted); see also 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1)-\n\n(c)(2).    If Vega can make this showing, the burden then shifts to\n\nWyeth to \"prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n\naction    would   have   been   taken   despite   the   protected   status.\"\n\nVelázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17. We address each of Vega's claims\n\nin turn.\n\n\n     4\n      Later in his deposition Vega contradicted himself by stating\nthat he informed Figueroa of his promotion in April or May 2006 and\nthe complaint contains a similar allegation. Before this court,\nVega claims that the February date is in fact correct. Construing\nthe evidence in Vega's favor, we find the February date to be the\napplicable date.   Notably, because the contradictory statements\nwere made in the complaint and Vega's deposition, this is\ndistinguishable from instances where a party attempts to defeat\nsummary judgment with an affidavit that contradicts previous\ndeposition testimony without explanation. See, e.g., Colantuoni v.\nAlfred Calcagni & Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                    -10-\n\f                     B. Reliability Engineer Position\n\n            Vega avers that Wyeth's failure to hire him for the\n\nreliability engineer position violated USERRA. USERRA prohibits an\n\nemployer from denying an employee a \"promotion\" based on the\n\nprotected factors relating to military service.                    38 U.S.C. §\n\n4311(a).     Though    Wyeth   claims    that   the    reliability      engineer\n\nposition did not constitute a direct promotion, it concedes that\n\nthe position carried higher pay, bonuses, and increased benefits --\n\ntypical indicia of a promotion.         Construing the statute broadly in\n\nVega's favor, we find the reliability engineer position was a\n\npromotion for purposes of USERRA.\n\n            Regarding Wyeth's motives for not hiring Vega for the\n\nposition   and   instead     hiring   outside   candidate     Gloryvee     Ramos\n\n(\"Ramos\"), Vega presented little evidence.              While Vega had some\n\nknowledge about the position's requirements, he did not know who\n\nelse applied for the position, those persons' qualifications, or\n\nwhy Wyeth recruited Ramos.            What Vega did know was that his\n\nsupervisors, Figueroa and Reinaldo Quiñones (\"Quiñones\"), were part\n\nof a panel that participated in the decision to hire Ramos.                   Vega\n\nfurther    alleges    that   Figueroa   informed      him   that   he   did    not\n\nrecommend Ramos because she was weak in the maintenance area.5\n\n\n     5\n      The district court found that Vega's attempt to introduce\nFigueroa's statement failed; however, it did not state on what\ngrounds it based this finding. We see no reason why the statement\nwould not be admissible.      To the extent the district court\nconstrued it as hearsay, we disagree. Figueroa was an employee of\n\n                                      -11-\n\fAdditionally, Vega expressed via affidavit a belief that he was\n\nbetter qualified than Ramos.      Wyeth, on the other hand, put forth\n\naffidavit evidence from Figueroa and Quiñones that Ramos was\n\nselected for the position because she was the strongest candidate.6\n\nFigueroa   also   stated,    contrary   to     Vega's   assertion,    that    he\n\npersonally recommended Ramos and agreed with the decision to hire\n\nher.\n\n           The contradictory evidence does raise an issue as to\n\nwhether Figueroa in fact recommended Ramos for the position.\n\nNonetheless,   the   inner   workings     of   the   hiring   panel   are    not\n\nrelevant, so long as Vega's military status was not a motivating or\n\nsubstantial factor in Wyeth's decision not to hire him.                      See\n\nVelázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17.         Vega has put forth no evidence\n\n\n\nWyeth involved in the hiring process and thus his statement is an\nadmission by a party-opponent and therefore an exception to the\nhearsay doctrine. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (A statement is not\nhearsay if it is offered against a party and is \"a statement by the\nparty's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of\nthe agency or employment, made during the existence of the\nrelationship.\").\n       6\n       Vega attempted to rebut Quiñones by submitting an affidavit\nin which Vega claimed that he previously testified that Quiñones\nsaid Vega was not hired for the position because he was not\nreliable due to his military service. Vega did not cite to any\nportion of his deposition testimony and this court, along with the\ndistrict court, could locate no such testimony. Therefore, like\nthe district court, we disregard Vega's allegation.      See Int'l\nAss'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing\nCenter, 103 F.3d 196, 206 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The summary judgment\nparadigm requires us to draw and respect only reasonable\ninferences; we need not infer that which is farfetched or\nfantastic.\").\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthat it was, essentially relying only on his personal belief that\n\nhe was more qualified.         Vega's subjective belief is insufficient.\n\nSee Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc., 155 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (An employee's \"personal opinion regarding his own job\n\nqualifications is not sufficiently probative on the issue of\n\npretext\"   in   an    employment    discrimination    action.).     Vega    is\n\nrequired to \"show evidence of discrimination other than the fact of\n\nnon-selection and membership in the protected class.\" Sheehan v.\n\nDepartment of Navy, 240 F.3d 1009, 1015 (Fed. Cir. 2001).               He has\n\nnot done so.         As Vega has not satisfied his burden, Wyeth is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\n     C. Low Performance Rating/Performance Improvement Plan\n\n           Vega next contends that his level two 2006 performance\n\nrating, which resulted in his being placed on a PIP, was given in\n\nviolation of USERRA.      USERRA prohibits an employer from improperly\n\ndenying \"any benefit of employment.\"            38 U.S.C. §4311(a).         A\n\n\"benefit of employment\" is defined to include \"any advantage . . .\n\nthat accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an\n\nemployer policy, plan, or practice.\"         38 U.S.C. § 4303(2).\n\n           Here      Wyeth's   employee   relations   director    put    forth\n\naffidavit evidence that employees who received a low performance\n\nrating, and were consequently placed on a PIP, were not eligible to\n\napply to other internal positions until the PIP was completed.\n\nFurther, the PIP itself stated that such employees were subject to\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdisciplinary action and termination for failure to complete the\n\nPIP.    Construing USERRA's definition of \"benefit of employment\"\n\nbroadly, we find that the ability to seek additional employment\n\nwithin the company, and the freedom from the threat of discipline\n\nor termination based on failure to complete the PIP, do constitute\n\n\"advantage[s].\"      Id.     Thus, Vega has raised an actionable claim\n\nwith respect to this issue.\n\n            However, Vega must also make the requisite showing under\n\nUSERRA that his military status was a motivating factor in Wyeth's\n\ndecision to award the low performance rating.              See 38 U.S.C. §\n\n4311(c)(1).     In support of his claim, Vega contends that: (1) he\n\nwas never subject to any disciplinary action before receiving the\n\nlow rating; (2) his rating was higher the previous year; and (3) he\n\nhad recently informed his supervisor, Gilberto Inserni (\"Inserni\"),\n\nwho issued the rating, about his military leave.           Thus, Vega avers\n\nhis military service was a motivating factor in the issuance of the\n\nlow rating. We find these arguments unpersuasive. First, Vega has\n\npresented no evidence that a disciplinary action must precede a low\n\nperformance rating.        Nor has he demonstrated that employee ratings\n\ncannot change from year to year as reflective of a change in that\n\nemployee's work performance. Finally, though the proximity in time\n\nbetween Vega informing Inserni of his leave and his receipt of the\n\nlow    rating   is   a   factor   for    consideration,   it   alone   is   not\n\nsufficient.     See Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 19 (finding that\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fproximity in time between military service and an adverse action is\n\nnot an \"exclusive test\").\n\n            Assuming arguendo that temporal proximity is sufficient\n\nto satisfy Vega's burden, Wyeth put forth evidence that it would\n\nhave given Vega a low rating and implemented a PIP regardless of\n\nhis military membership.     In particular, the PIP itself documented\n\nVega's   various   employee    performance   issues,       including    his\n\nargumentative behavior, failure to address equipment reliability\n\nissues, and failure to timely address assignments.           Vega did not\n\nspecifically rebut these findings, but generally disagreed with his\n\nreview and believed himself an excellent employee.              Moreover,\n\nresponding to Vega's allegations of discriminatory treatment and\n\nrequest for an investigation into his low rating, Wyeth's human\n\nresources   director   and   associate   director   each    conducted    an\n\ninvestigation, which included multiple meetings with Vega and the\n\ngathering of information.     Wyeth concluded that the rating should\n\nstand and that it was not the result of discriminatory acts.\n\n            Other than proximity in time, Vega has not come forth\n\nwith any evidence that his military status was a motivating factor\n\nin Wyeth awarding him the low performance rating and implementing\n\nthe PIP.     See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1).      Furthermore, Wyeth has\n\nsufficiently established that it would have taken such action\n\nregardless of Vega's military membership.       Id.    In light of the\n\nabove, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f               D. Performance Improvement Plan Extension\n\n          Even if the PIP itself can be deemed valid, Vega claims\n\nthat Wyeth's extension of the PIP was an improper discriminatory\n\naction.   For the same reasons the low performance rating and\n\nimplementation    of   the   PIP     could   constitute    a   denial   of    an\n\nemployment benefit under USERRA; so too could the PIP's extension.\n\nSee 38 U.S.C. § 4303(2) (defining a \"benefit of employment\" as \"any\n\nadvantage . . . that accrues by reason of an employment contract or\n\nagreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice\").               Vega has\n\ntherefore raised a cognizable USERRA claim and we turn to the\n\nmerits of his argument.\n\n          In     our   review   of    the    record,   the     following     was\n\nestablished as to the PIP's extension.         The PIP itself stated that\n\nalthough Vega completed the set goals, it was being extended\n\nbecause of: (1) an email Vega sent in which he described a\n\nsupervisor in a disrespectful manner; (2) a letter Vega improperly\n\nsolicited his co-workers to sign attesting to his job performance;\n\nand (3) Vega's authorized leave.        The PIP was to remain open for at\n\nleast three months after Vega returned from leave so that positive\n\nbehavior and work habits could be verified.               Additionally, Vega\n\ntestified that one of his supervisors, Andrew Espejo (\"Espejo\"),\n\ninformed him that he did not pass the PIP because his performance\n\nwas affected by his military service.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f           Based on the above facts, the district court found that\n\nVega satisfied the first prong under USERRA, particularly his\n\nburden of demonstrating that his military service was a motivating\n\nfactor in Wyeth's actions.7   See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1).      We agree.\n\nBoth Espejo's comments, and the language contained in the PIP\n\nattributing the extension to Vega's leave, satisfied his burden on\n\nthis issue.\n\n           The district court then moved to the second prong --\n\nWyeth's burden to demonstrate that it would have extended the PIP\n\nin the absence of Vega's military status.         Id.   The court found\n\nthat Wyeth satisfied this burden and was therefore entitled to\n\nsummary judgment.8   In finding for Wyeth, the court relied on\n\nVega's   disrespectful   email   and    the   inappropriate   letter   he\n\ncirculated.    Additionally, the court believed that Wyeth was\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Before deciding the merits, the district court noted that\nalthough it would not do so, it could dismiss this claim because\nVega was seeking only monetary damages and the sole remedy would be\nreinstatement of his pre-PIP status. We disagree. Were Vega able\nto prove that he lost wages in the form of a salary increase or\nbenefits based on the PIP's extension, he could potentially recover\nmonetary damages. See 38 U.S.C. § 4323(d)(1)(B) (\"The court may\nrequire the employer to compensate the person for any loss of wages\nor benefits suffered by reason of such employer's failure to comply\nwith the provisions of this chapter.\").\n     8\n      The magistrate judge who issued the report and recommendation\nin this matter found that Wyeth had not satisfied its burden on\nthis issue, and recommended that summary judgment be denied on the\nPIP extension claim.    The judge who issued the final decision,\nhowever, disagreed.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fgenerally entitled to extend a PIP when an employee was on leave\n\nduring a portion of it.         This reasoning is not persuasive.\n\n            First, while the email and letter may be sufficient\n\ngrounds on which Wyeth could base the PIP's extension, the inquiry\n\nis not whether Wyeth was entitled to extend the PIP, but whether\n\nsuch \"action would have been taken in the absence of [Vega's\n\nmilitary]    membership.\"        38   U.S.C.    §    4311(c)(1);     see,     e.g.,\n\nVelázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 20 (holding that with respect to\n\nemployee termination, \"[t]he issue under USERRA is not whether an\n\nemployer is ‘entitled' to dismiss an employee for a particular\n\nreason, but whether it would have done so if the employee were not\n\nin the military\").        Specifically, Wyeth must \"demonstrate, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that it would indeed have\" extended\n\nthe PIP regardless of Vega's military service.               Velázquez-García,\n\n473 F.3d at 20.\n\n            Here    the   PIP   itself   stated      that   Vega    successfully\n\ncompleted its objectives prior to Wyeth's extending it.                 Further,\n\nEspejo purportedly remarked that Vega did not pass the PIP due to\n\nhis   military     service.     Notably,     Wyeth   has    not    rebutted   this\n\nassertion.    Given the PIP's language and the testimony concerning\n\nEspejo's comment, there \"is sufficient doubt on this issue to make\n\nit a jury question.\"       Id.; see also Sensing v. Outback Steakhouse\n\nof Florida, LLC, 575 F.3d 145, 153 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Calero-\n\nCerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004))\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f(In instances where \"the record contains inconsistencies 'that\n\nfavor in some lights the defendant[] and in others the plaintiff,'\n\nas   long   as   the   'plaintiff's   evidence   is   both   cognizable   and\n\nsufficiently strong to support a verdict in [his] favor, the\n\nfactfinder must be allowed to determine which version of the facts\n\nis most compelling.'\")\n\n            Further, the district court's finding that Wyeth would\n\nhave extended the PIP for any employee on leave -- whether it be\n\nmilitary leave, sick leave, or otherwise -- is not relevant.              The\n\nfact that Wyeth may have treated other absences similarly does not\n\novercome the fact that it may have based its treatment of Vega, at\n\nleast in part, on his military absences.              See Erickson v. U.S.\n\nPostal Service, 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"An employer\n\ncannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely\n\ndiscriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when\n\nthat absence was for military service.\").\n\n            We hold that the evidence is sufficiently strong that a\n\nreasonable jury could find in Vega's favor; therefore, the district\n\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.\n\n                         E. Facility Access Denial\n\n            Next Vega contends that Wyeth wrongfully discharged and\n\nthen reinstated him while he was away on military leave.                  This\n\nclaim is based on the incident in which Vega attempted to enter\n\nWyeth's plant but was turned away by a security guard.                Wyeth\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fadmits that it restricted Vega's access over security concerns but\n\ndenies that it terminated Vega.   We find that Vega has failed to\n\nraise a cognizable claim with respect to this issue.\n\n          Though there is some factual dispute surrounding this\n\nclaim, such dispute is immaterial.    Specifically, it is irrelevant\n\nwhether Vega's access to the plant was restricted in response to an\n\nalleged comment about the Virginia Tech massacre or not.     \"To be\n\nconsidered material, a disputed fact must have the potential to\n\naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\" Rochester\n\nFord Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(internal citation omitted).   In this case, why Vega's access was\n\nrestricted does not affect the outcome of this suit.        What is\n\nrelevant is this -- the evidence conclusively demonstrated that\n\nwhile Vega's access to the plant was restricted on that one\n\noccasion, he was not terminated from employment.    Most notably, he\n\ncontinued to receive a salary and benefits, and never received a\n\ntermination letter.     For this court to conclude that Vega was\n\nterminated solely based on a comment by a security guard, which may\n\nhave been incorrect or misconstrued, would require us to draw an\n\nimprobable inference.    \"Although employment discrimination cases\n\ndeal with elusive concepts such as motive or intent,\" summary\n\njudgment is compelled \"if the non-moving party rests his case\n\nmerely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and\n\nunsupported speculation.\" Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f511 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted).\n\nThus Vega was not denied \"retention in employment\" pursuant to\n\nUSERRA.    See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).\n\n            Further, Vega's restricted access to the plant cannot be\n\ndeemed a denial of a \"benefit of employment\" because he was on\n\nleave at the time and had no need to access the plant.                      See 38\n\nU.S.C. §§ 4303(2), 4311(a).           Nor can it constitute an \"adverse\n\nemployment    action\"     in   retaliation    for     Vega's    VETS    complaint,\n\nbecause the incident took place prior to Wyeth's learning about the\n\ncomplaint.     See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b).             As Vega has failed to set\n\nforth an actionable claim based on this one incidence of restricted\n\naccess, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n                         F. Hostile Work Environment\n\n            Vega alleges that dating back to October 2006, he was\n\nsubjected     to   comments     and   name     calling     by     various      Wyeth\n\nsupervisors, related to his military service. Specifically, on one\n\noccasion Inserni asked Vega whether his military training was\n\nsimilar to the American military movie \"Rambo.\"                    Additionally,\n\nQuiñones     expressed    disagreement       with    the   wars    in   Iraq    and\n\nAfghanistan, a sentiment which Vega admittedly heard often and in\n\nfact agreed with.        Quiñones also once questioned Vega about his\n\nstatus with the military, an inquiry Vega admitted was reasonable\n\nfor a supervisor to make. Further, Inserni and Quiñones repeatedly\n\nreferred to Vega as \"soldier\", \"little soldier\", \"sergeant\", and\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f\"Rolandito.\"     Another supervisor, Antonio Otano, also referred to\n\nVega as \"Rolandito.\"      This moniker, referring to a famous missing\n\nboy in Puerto Rico, was taken by Vega to be a negative commentary\n\non his absences for military service. Vega concedes that this\n\nsuspicion was not based on anything he was told and in fact he\n\noften took leave for reasons other than military service.                  From\n\nVega's vantage he found the above comments discriminatory and\n\nderogatory and he sought psychiatric help, in part, he says, based\n\non the work environment at Wyeth.\n\n            Neither the Supreme Court nor any court of appeals has\n\ndecided whether a hostile work environment claim is cognizable\n\nunder USERRA.9     For purposes of this decision we assume, without\n\ndeciding, that it is.           In order to establish a hostile work\n\nenvironment,   Vega     \"must   show    harassing   behavior    'sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment.'\"\n\nPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 133 (2004)\n\n(quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67\n\n(1986)).    He must also establish that \"the offending behavior . .\n\n.

In   making    this\n\ndetermination, we examine \"'all the circumstances,' including 'the\n\nfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\n\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;      and    whether         it     unreasonably     interferes   with    an\n\nemployee's work performance.'\"                     National R.R.

Here Vega alleges a very\n\nlimited number of comments, along with more frequent name calling.\n\nAlthough the evidence demonstrates that the comments and name\n\ncalling may have been subjectively offensive to Vega, in this\n\ncourt's opinion, neither amounted to objectively offensive conduct\n\nas    the   behavior       was   not    severe,        physically   threatening,     or\n\nhumiliating.      Moreover, Vega has failed to set forth sufficient\n\nevidence from which a jury could conclude that the complained of\n\nconduct interfered with his work performance to an extent that is\n\nunreasonable or that altered the conditions of his employment.\n\n             We note that because the inquiry into the existence of a\n\nhostile work environment is fact specific, \"the determination is\n\n\n                                              -23-\n\foften reserved for a fact finder.\"                    Pomales, 447 F.3d at 83.\n\nNonetheless,     \"summary      judgment    is    an    appropriate    vehicle        for\n\n'polic[ing] the baseline for hostile work environment claims.'\"\n\nId.

VETS Complaint\n\n            Vega contends that in response to the complaint he filed\n\nwith   VETS,    Wyeth    discriminated      against      him    and   took    adverse\n\nemployment action in violation of USERRA. See 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b).\n\nThis court has defined an adverse employment action under Title VII\n\nas \"one that 'affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions of\n\nthe workplace.'\"        Morales-Vallanes v. Potter, 605 F.3d 27, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2010)(quoting Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,\n\n548 U.S. 53, 61-62 (2006)) (alteration in original).                   The Seventh\n\nCircuit has applied a similar definition in a USERRA action.                         See\n\nCrews v. City of Mt. Vernon, 567 F.3d 860, 869 (7th Cir. 2009)(\"An\n\nadverse employment action is one that significantly alters the\n\nterms and conditions of the employee's job.\") (internal citation\n\nomitted).      In the context of Title VII, the Supreme Court has held\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fthat the \"term 'discriminate against' refers to distinctions or\n\ndifferences   in    treatment      that   injure   protected   individuals.\"\n\nBurlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. at 59.\n\n           Vega filed a VETS complaint in March 2007.               However,\n\nWyeth presented evidence, including an affidavit from its human\n\nresources director and the entire VETS file, which established that\n\nit did not become aware of Vega's VETS complaint until September\n\n2007.    Vega has offered no contradictory evidence.                Thus any\n\nretaliatory actions necessarily had to take place after this date.\n\nAs such, the only actionable events alleged by Vega based on his\n\ntheory of retaliation are: (1) extension of the PIP; (2) his not\n\nbeing awarded salary increases in 2008 and 2009; and (3) continued\n\nname calling.\n\n           As discussed above, Vega put forth evidence on which a\n\njury could determine that the PIP was improperly extended due to\n\nhis military service; however, he has presented no evidence that it\n\nwas   extended     in   response    to    his   VETS   complaint.    He   has\n\nsignificantly failed to demonstrate whether the person or persons\n\ninvolved in the decision to extend the PIP were even aware of the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n           Similarly, with regards to potential salary increases in\n\n2008 and 2009, Vega has presented no evidence of Wyeth's process or\n\ncriteria for evaluating and awarding raises, or evidence of the\n\npersons responsible for making such salary determinations.            In the\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fabsence of such evidence, this court cannot simply assume that Vega\n\nwas entitled to a salary increase in 2008 and 2009.                Nor can we\n\nassume that the persons making these compensation decisions were\n\naware of the VETS complaint.            As a result, Vega has not met his\n\nburden of demonstrating that his filing of the VETS complaint was\n\na motivating factor in Wyeth's extension of the PIP or decision not\n\nto increase his salary, or that it generated any adverse employment\n\naction against him.\n\n          With respect to the name calling, we question whether\n\nsuch   conduct      constituted    an     adverse     employment   action     or\n\ndiscrimination in light of the meaning that courts have applied to\n\nthese terms.        See Morales-Vallanes, 605 F.3d at 35 (An adverse\n\nemployment action \"'affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions\n\nof the workplace.'\"); Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548\n\nU.S. at 59 (\"'[D]iscriminate against' refers to distinction or\n\ndifferences    in    treatment    that   injure     protected   individuals.\")\n\nHowever, assuming that such comments are actionable, Vega has also\n\nfailed to satisfy his burden on this issue.\n\n          First, the name calling took place both before and after\n\nVega filed the VETS complaint, with no escalation alleged after\n\nSeptember 2007.       This is a fatal flaw in Vega's argument.              See,\n\ne.g., Frazier v. Fairhaven School Committee, 276 F.3d 52, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).      Further, we are persuaded by the Seventh Circuit's\n\nholding that with respect to USERRA retaliation actions, \"negative\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\femployer comments will support a retaliation claim only if they are\n\n'severe and pervasive.'\" Crews, 567 F.3d at 870 (internal citation\n\nomitted).    Objectively viewed, the name calling directed at Vega\n\nwas not, in our opinion, severe.           Therefore he has failed to\n\nestablish   that   Wyeth   retaliated    against   him   in   violation   of\n\nUSERRA.10 Wyeth is thus entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n            For the above reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nEach party to bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Vega claims that Wyeth's alleged retaliation in response to\nthe VETS complaint not only violated USERRA but also the Puerto\nRico Whistle-Blower Act (\"Law 115\").     See 29 LPRA §§ 194-194b.\nVega's burden under Law 115 is more stringent then under USERRA, as\nthe   former  requires   an   employee   to  establish   not   only\ndiscrimination, but that the employer's non-discriminatory reason\nis pretext. See 29 LPRA § 194a(c). As Vega failed to establish a\nUSERRA violation, he cannot establish a Law 115 violation.\n\n                                  -27-\n\f",

Vega-Colón (\"Vega\") brought suit against his employer, defendant-appellee Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (\"Wyeth\"). Vega contends that Wyeth discriminated and retaliated against him based on his military service in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\"USERRA\") and Puerto Rico law. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4335; 29 LPRA §§ 194-194b. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Wyeth, and Vega timely appealed. After careful consideration, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to Vega, the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See </i><i>Bukuras v. Mueller Group, LLC,</i> 592 F.3d 255, 261 (1st Cir.2010). The general facts pertinent to Vega's allegations are set forth below, and more detailed facts are provided when we analyze Vega's individual claims.</p>\n<p>Wyeth is a pharmaceutical company located in Puerto Rico. In 2002, Vega was hired by Wyeth as a \"packaging equipment supervisor.\" Vega was also a member of the United States Army Reserve. During his employment at Wyeth, Vega alternated between active and inactive status with the Army. Specifically, from 2002 to 2004 Vega was active and took various leaves from Wyeth for military training. From 2004 to February 2007, Vega went on inactive status and did not leave for any military training. In February 2007, Vega returned to active status and was promoted to captain with the condition that he join a military unit and participate in military <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> exercises. Vega's Army unit was mobilized in November 2007 and he has been on military leave since then.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, the position of \"reliability engineer\" became available at Wyeth and Vega applied. Vega, along with several other internal candidates, was not hired; an outside candidate was hired instead.</p>\n<p>In February 2007, Vega received a job performance evaluation from Wyeth for his 2006 employment year. Per policy, Wyeth provided all of its employees with an annual written evaluation, which included a rating of between one and five with five being the most desirable. For the years 2003 through 2005, Vega was rated a three or \"solid performer.\" For the year 2006, Vega's rating declined to a two, which signaled \"needs improvement.\" Vega disagreed with his evaluation and requested that Wyeth initiate an investigation, which it did.</p>\n<p>In April 2007, Vega filed a discrimination complaint with the United States Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and Training Service (\"VETS\"), based on Wyeth's failure to hire him for the reliability engineer position. Finding no merit to Vega's accusations, VETS denied the complaint; however, the complaint was re-instituted at a later point when Vega presented additional evidence. Vega eventually voluntarily withdrew the VETS complaint.</p>\n<p>On May 7, 2007, Vega met with Wyeth's employee relations director and site director, though what was discussed at this meeting is disputed.<sup>[1]</sup> According to Wyeth, the parties discussed the results of the investigation it conducted into Vega's 2006 performance evaluation, in particular that the investigation revealed no discriminatory acts. Vega denies such a conversation took place. Also according to Wyeth, at this meeting Vega made a threatening comment to the effect that Wyeth's site director made it easy for one to understand why massacres like the one at Virginia Tech take place.<sup>[2]</sup> Vega has no memory of such a comment.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that shortly after this meeting Wyeth restricted Vega's access to its plant. Vega, who was out on leave at the time, learned of this restriction when he attempted to enter the plant to drop off his military orders. Vega was stopped and informed by a security guard that he could not enter because Wyeth's computer database listed him as terminated. Wyeth contends that Vega was not in fact fired but concedes his access was restricted because of security concerns over his comment about the Virginia Tech massacre. Notably, Vega never received a termination letter and he continued to receive a salary and benefits.</p>\n<p>At some point, Vega returned from leave with his access to the plant restored. Then in July 2007, Vega was placed on a \"performance improvement plan\" (\"PIP\"). Per Wyeth policy, all employees who received a performance evaluation rating of two or lower were placed on a PIP. The PIP established objectives for Vega to complete within ninety days, which he timely completed. That November, Vega was informed that although he had completed the PIP's objectives, the PIP would be extended for other reasons until he returned from military service. Vega's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Army unit was mobilized that month.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Around the same time, Vega instituted the underlying action alleging past and continuing discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. Particularly, he claims Wyeth took the following improper actions: (1) failing to hire him for the reliability engineer position; (2) awarding him a low performance rating; (3) extending the PIP; (4) discharging and then reinstating him; (5) allowing a hostile work environment; and (6) retaliating against him for filing the VETS complaint. Wyeth moved for summary judgment on all of these claims, and shortly before trial its motion was granted. Final judgment was entered in Wyeth's favor and Vega timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>This court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgement de novo. <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.2006). If there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm. <i>Id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2). \"In order to overcome a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must put forth specific facts to support the conclusion that a triable issue subsists.\" <i>Martínez-Rodríguez v. Guevara,</i> 597 F.3d 414, 419 (1st Cir.2010). On each issue on which the non-moving party has the burden of proof, \"that party must present definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation omitted). \"Summary judgment for the defendant[] is appropriate when the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable person could find in favor of the plaintiff.\" <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. USERRA</h2>\n<p>The purpose of USERRA is to encourage non-career military service, minimize disruption based on this service, and prevent discrimination against service members. 38 U.S.C. § 4301. To this end, USERRA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</blockquote>\n<p>38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). It further provides that an employer \"may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person . . . has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded\" under USERRA. 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b). The term \"uniformed service\" means in pertinent part the Armed Forces when engaged in active duty for training. 38 U.S.C. § 4303(16).</p>\n<p>Vega contends that the alleged discriminatory and retaliatory actions taken by Wyeth were the result of his decision to return to active duty with the Army, which he ultimately did in February 2007. Wyeth urges that because Vega did not return to active duty until February 2007, he was not protected under USERRA until this date. Vega counters that the applicable date was February 2006, which is the month he was selected for the position of Army captain with the condition that he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> return to active status and also the month he informed one of his supervisors that he would be returning to active status. The district court disagreed with both parties' contentions. It found that because USERRA protects individuals who apply for active duty; the applicable date of coverage was when Vega informed his supervisors at Wyeth that he intended to apply to join an active military unit. Based on this reasoning, the court found November 2006 to be the applicable date.</p>\n<p>The initial inquiry for this court is what protected status and/or conduct served as the basis for Wyeth's allegedly improper actions. Vega claims that Wyeth's actions stemmed from his decision to apply for active duty and his resulting military service. Thus Vega's application to perform service and his subsequent membership in a uniformed service are the respective conduct and status at issue. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).</p>\n<p>The next question is when did the protected conduct and status occur. It is undisputed that Vega returned to active duty in February 2007 and thus became a member of a \"uniformed service\" for purposes of USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4303(16). The more difficult question is when did Vega \"appl[y] to perform\" active duty service for purposes of USERRA. <i>Id.</i> Construing the record carefully, we find that Vega's notification to his Wyeth supervisors that he was returning to active duty constituted such an application. While informing a supervisor of one's intent to return to service is not strictly speaking an application for service; it is only logical that USERRA coverage would be triggered at the point in time in which an employer has information about an employee on which it could base discriminatory treatment. Here Vega expressed a definite intent to return to active duty in the near future. To deny an employee who has expressed such a definite intention the protection of USERRA until his literal application for service is signed and delivered would be contrary to the stated purposes of USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4301. This conclusion is further supported by the principle that USERRA should be broadly construed in favor of military service members as its purpose is to protect such members. <i>See </i><i>Hill v. Michelin North America, Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d 307, 312-13 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing <i>Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp.,</i> 447 U.S. 191, 196, 100 S.Ct. 2100, 65 L.Ed.2d 53 (1980)(construing USERRA's predecessor liberally in favor of military members)); <i>see also </i><i>Gordon v. Wawa, Inc.,</i> 388 F.3d 78, 81 (3rd Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Thus, the final question is when did Vega inform his supervisors that he was returning to active duty. As noted above, the district court found this date to be November 2006. We disagree. In November 2006, Vega did inform two of his supervisors that he was accepted into a military unit and would start performing drills. However, Vega testified at deposition that earlier, in February 2006, shortly after receiving his invitation from the Army to become a captain, he informed his supervisor Johnny Figueroa (\"Figueroa\") that he was returning to active status and there was a high possibility he would be mobilized. Wyeth has not disputed this statement. Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Vega, February 2006 is the date on which he informed his supervisors of a definite intent to return to active duty, thus triggering USERRA.<sup>[4]</sup> Because Vega's April <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> 2006 application for the reliability engineer position was the earliest action related to his claims, any alleged improper conduct by Wyeth necessarily took place after USERRA was triggered.</p>\n<p>Now we turn to the merits, particularly whether Vega's application for service and his resulting military service formed the basis for any of Wyeth's allegedly improper actions. In assessing a USERRA claim, the burden is on Vega to make an initial showing that his military status \"was at least a motivating or substantial factor in [Wyeth's] action.\" <i>Velázquez-García v. Horizon Lines of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 473 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir.2007) (internal citation omitted); <i>see also</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1)-(c)(2). If Vega can make this showing, the burden then shifts to Wyeth to \"prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\" <i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 17. We address each of Vega's claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Reliability Engineer Position</h2>\n<p>Vega avers that Wyeth's failure to hire him for the reliability engineer position violated USERRA. USERRA prohibits an employer from denying an employee a \"promotion\" based on the protected factors relating to military service. 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). Though Wyeth claims that the reliability engineer position did not constitute a direct promotion, it concedes that the position carried higher pay, bonuses, and increased benefits  typical indicia of a promotion. Construing the statute broadly in Vega's favor, we find the reliability engineer position was a promotion for purposes of USERRA.</p>\n<p>Regarding Wyeth's motives for not hiring Vega for the position and instead hiring outside candidate Gloryvee Ramos (\"Ramos\"), Vega presented little evidence. While Vega had some knowledge about the position's requirements, he did not know who else applied for the position, those persons' qualifications, or why Wyeth recruited Ramos. What Vega did know was that his supervisors, Figueroa and Reinaldo Quiñones (\"Quiñones\"), were part of a panel that participated in the decision to hire Ramos. Vega further alleges that Figueroa informed him that he did not recommend Ramos because she was weak in the maintenance area.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, Vega expressed via affidavit a belief that he was better qualified than Ramos. Wyeth, on the other hand, put forth affidavit evidence from Figueroa and Quiñones that Ramos was selected for the position because she was the strongest candidate.<sup>[6]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> Figueroa also stated, contrary to Vega's assertion, that he personally recommended Ramos and agreed with the decision to hire her.</p>\n<p>The contradictory evidence does raise an issue as to whether Figueroa in fact recommended Ramos for the position. Nonetheless, the inner workings of the hiring panel are not relevant, so long as Vega's military status was not a motivating or substantial factor in Wyeth's decision not to hire him. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 17. Vega has put forth no evidence that it was, essentially relying only on his personal belief that he was more qualified. Vega's subjective belief is insufficient. <i>See </i><i>Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc.,</i> 155 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1998) (An employee's \"personal opinion regarding his own job qualifications is not sufficiently probative on the issue of pretext\" in an employment discrimination action.). Vega is required to \"show evidence of discrimination other than the fact of non-selection and membership in the protected class.\" <i>Sheehan v. Department of Navy,</i> 240 F.3d 1009, 1015 (Fed.Cir.2001). He has not done so. As Vega has not satisfied his burden, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Low Performance Rating/Performance Improvement Plan</h2>\n<p>Vega next contends that his level two 2006 performance rating, which resulted in his being placed on a PIP, was given in violation of USERRA. USERRA prohibits an employer from improperly denying \"any benefit of employment.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). A \"benefit of employment\" is defined to include \"any advantage ... that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4303(2).</p>\n<p>Here Wyeth's employee relations director put forth affidavit evidence that employees who received a low performance rating, and were consequently placed on a PIP, were not eligible to apply to other internal positions until the PIP was completed. Further, the PIP itself stated that such employees were subject to disciplinary action and termination for failure to complete the PIP. Construing USERRA's definition of \"benefit of employment\" broadly, we find that the ability to seek additional employment within the company, and the freedom from the threat of discipline or termination based on failure to complete the PIP, do constitute \"advantage[s].\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, Vega has raised an actionable claim with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p>However, Vega must also make the requisite showing under USERRA that his military status was a motivating factor in Wyeth's decision to award the low performance rating. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). In support of his claim, Vega contends that: (1) he was never subject to any disciplinary action before receiving the low rating; (2) his rating was higher the previous year; and (3) he had recently informed his supervisor, Gilberto Inserni (\"Inserni\"), who issued the rating, about his military leave. Thus, Vega avers his military service was a motivating factor in the issuance of the low rating. We find these arguments unpersuasive. First, Vega has presented no evidence that a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> disciplinary action must precede a low performance rating. Nor has he demonstrated that employee ratings cannot change from year to year as reflective of a change in that employee's work performance. Finally, though the proximity in time between Vega informing Inserni of his leave and his receipt of the low rating is a factor for consideration, it alone is not sufficient. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 19 (finding that proximity in time between military service and an adverse action is not an \"exclusive test\").</p>\n<p>Assuming arguendo that temporal proximity is sufficient to satisfy Vega's burden, Wyeth put forth evidence that it would have given Vega a low rating and implemented a PIP regardless of his military membership. In particular, the PIP itself documented Vega's various employee performance issues, including his argumentative behavior, failure to address equipment reliability issues, and failure to timely address assignments. Vega did not specifically rebut these findings, but generally disagreed with his review and believed himself an excellent employee. Moreover, responding to Vega's allegations of discriminatory treatment and request for an investigation into his low rating, Wyeth's human resources director and associate director each conducted an investigation, which included multiple meetings with Vega and the gathering of information. Wyeth concluded that the rating should stand and that it was not the result of discriminatory acts.</p>\n<p>Other than proximity in time, Vega has not come forth with any evidence that his military status was a motivating factor in Wyeth awarding him the low performance rating and implementing the PIP. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). Furthermore, Wyeth has sufficiently established that it would have taken such action regardless of Vega's military membership. <i>Id.</i> In light of the above, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Performance Improvement Plan Extension</h2>\n<p>Even if the PIP itself can be deemed valid, Vega claims that Wyeth's extension of the PIP was an improper discriminatory action. For the same reasons the low performance rating and implementation of the PIP could constitute a denial of an employment benefit under USERRA; so too could the PIP's extension. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4303(2) (defining a \"benefit of employment\" as \"any advantage ... that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice\"). Vega has therefore raised a cognizable USERRA claim and we turn to the merits of his argument.</p>\n<p>In our review of the record, the following was established as to the PIP's extension. The PIP itself stated that although Vega completed the set goals, it was being extended because of: (1) an email Vega sent in which he described a supervisor in a disrespectful manner; (2) a letter Vega improperly solicited his co-workers to sign attesting to his job performance; and (3) Vega's authorized leave. The PIP was to remain open for at least three months after Vega returned from leave so that positive behavior and work habits could be verified. Additionally, Vega testified that one of his supervisors, Andrew Espejo (\"Espejo\"), informed him that he did not pass the PIP because his performance was affected by his military service.</p>\n<p>Based on the above facts, the district court found that Vega satisfied the first prong under USERRA, particularly his burden of demonstrating that his military service was a motivating factor in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Wyeth's actions.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). We agree. Both Espejo's comments, and the language contained in the PIP attributing the extension to Vega's leave, satisfied his burden on this issue.</p>\n<p>The district court then moved to the second prong-Wyeth's burden to demonstrate that it would have extended the PIP in the absence of Vega's military status. <i>Id.</i> The court found that Wyeth satisfied this burden and was therefore entitled to summary judgment.<sup>[8]</sup> In finding for Wyeth, the court relied on Vega's disrespectful email and the inappropriate letter he circulated. Additionally, the court believed that Wyeth was generally entitled to extend a PIP when an employee was on leave during a portion of it. This reasoning is not persuasive.</p>\n<p>First, while the email and letter may be sufficient grounds on which Wyeth could base the PIP's extension, the inquiry is not whether Wyeth was entitled to extend the PIP, but whether such \"action would have been taken in the absence of [Vega's military] membership.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 20 (holding that with respect to employee termination, \"[t]he issue under USERRA is not whether an employer is `entitled' to dismiss an employee for a particular reason, but whether it would have done so if the employee were not in the military\"). Specifically, Wyeth must \"demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it <i>would</i> indeed have\" extended the PIP regardless of Vega's military service. <i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 20.</p>\n<p>Here the PIP itself stated that Vega successfully completed its objectives prior to Wyeth's extending it. Further, Espejo purportedly remarked that Vega did not pass the PIP due to his military service. Notably, Wyeth has not rebutted this assertion. Given the PIP's language and the testimony concerning Espejo's comment, there \"is sufficient doubt on this issue to make it a jury question.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Sensing v. Outback Steakhouse of Florida, LLC,</i> 575 F.3d 145, 153 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir.2004)) (In instances where \"the record contains inconsistencies `that favor in some lights the defendant[] and in others the plaintiff,' as long as the `plaintiff's evidence is both cognizable and sufficiently strong to support a verdict in [his] favor, the factfinder must be allowed to determine which version of the facts is most compelling.'\").</p>\n<p>Further, the district court's finding that Wyeth would have extended the PIP for any employee on leave  whether it be military leave, sick leave, or otherwise  is not relevant. The fact that Wyeth may have treated other absences similarly does not overcome the fact that it may have based its treatment of Vega, at least in part, on his military absences. <i>See </i><i>Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service,</i> 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> (Fed.Cir.2009) (\"An employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service.\").</p>\n<p>We hold that the evidence is sufficiently strong that a reasonable jury could find in Vega's favor; therefore, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Facility Access Denial</h2>\n<p>Next Vega contends that Wyeth wrongfully discharged and then reinstated him while he was away on military leave. This claim is based on the incident in which Vega attempted to enter Wyeth's plant but was turned away by a security guard. Wyeth admits that it restricted Vega's access over security concerns but denies that it terminated Vega. We find that Vega has failed to raise a cognizable claim with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p>Though there is some factual dispute surrounding this claim, such dispute is immaterial. Specifically, it is irrelevant whether Vega's access to the plant was restricted in response to an alleged comment about the Virginia Tech massacre or not. \"To be considered material, a disputed fact must have the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\" <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal citation omitted). In this case, why Vega's access was restricted does not affect the outcome of this suit. What is relevant is this  the evidence conclusively demonstrated that while Vega's access to the plant was restricted on that one occasion, he was not terminated from employment. Most notably, he continued to receive a salary and benefits, and never received a termination letter. For this court to conclude that Vega was terminated solely based on a comment by a security guard, which may have been incorrect or misconstrued, would require us to draw an improbable inference. \"Although employment discrimination cases deal with elusive concepts such as motive or intent,\" summary judgment is compelled \"if the non-moving party rests his case merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 511 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir.2007) (internal citation omitted). Thus Vega was not denied \"retention in employment\" pursuant to USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).</p>\n<p>Further, Vega's restricted access to the plant cannot be deemed a denial of a \"benefit of employment\" because he was on leave at the time and had no need to access the plant. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. §§ 4303(2), 4311(a). Nor can it constitute an \"adverse employment action\" in retaliation for Vega's VETS complaint, because the incident took place prior to Wyeth's learning about the complaint. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b). As Vega has failed to set forth an actionable claim based on this one incidence of restricted access, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. Hostile Work Environment</h2>\n<p>Vega alleges that dating back to October 2006, he was subjected to comments and name calling by various Wyeth supervisors, related to his military service. Specifically, on one occasion Inserni asked Vega whether his military training was similar to the American military movie \"Rambo.\" Additionally, Quiñones expressed disagreement with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a sentiment which Vega admittedly heard often and in fact agreed with. Quiñones also once questioned Vega about his status with the military, an inquiry Vega admitted was reasonable for a supervisor to make. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Further, Inserni and Quiñones repeatedly referred to Vega as \"soldier\", \"little soldier\", \"sergeant\", and \"Rolandito.\" Another supervisor, Antonio Otano, also referred to Vega as \"Rolandito.\" This moniker, referring to a famous missing boy in Puerto Rico, was taken by Vega to be a negative commentary on his absences for military service. Vega concedes that this suspicion was not based on anything he was told and in fact he often took leave for reasons other than military service. From Vega's vantage he found the above comments discriminatory and derogatory and he sought psychiatric help, in part, he says, based on the work environment at Wyeth.</p>\n<p>Neither the Supreme Court nor any court of appeals has decided whether a hostile work environment claim is cognizable under USERRA.<sup>[9]</sup> For purposes of this decision we assume, without deciding, that it is. In order to establish a hostile work environment, Vega \"must show harassing behavior `sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment.'\" <i>Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders,</i> 542 U.S. 129, 133, 124 S.Ct. 2342, 159 L.Ed.2d 204 (2004) (quoting <i>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,</i> 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)). He must also establish that \"the offending behavior ... `create[s] an abusive working environment.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 146-147, 124 S.Ct. 2342 (internal citation omitted). The harassment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive. <i>See </i><i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998); <i>Roman v. Potter,</i> 604 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir.2010) (addressing a hostile work environment claim under Title VII).</p>\n<p>Here there is no basis for a jury to conclude that Vega was subject to a hostile work environment. In making this determination, we examine \"`all the circumstances,' including `the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'\" <i>National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. 101, 116, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)). Here Vega alleges a very limited number of comments, along with more frequent name calling. Although the evidence demonstrates that the comments and name calling may have been subjectively offensive to Vega, in this court's opinion, neither amounted to objectively offensive conduct as the behavior was not severe, physically threatening, or humiliating. Moreover, Vega has failed to set forth sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the complained of conduct interfered with his work performance to an extent that is unreasonable or that altered the conditions of his employment.</p>\n<p>We note that because the inquiry into the existence of a hostile work environment is fact specific, \"the determination is often reserved for a fact finder.\" <i>Pomales,</i> 447 F.3d at 83. Nonetheless, \"summary judgment is an appropriate vehicle for `polic[ing] the baseline for hostile work environment claims.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc.,</i> 195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc))(alteration in original). In the instant matter, Vega has failed to establish even a baseline claim of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> an \"abusive working environment.\" <i>Pennsylvania State Police,</i> 542 U.S. at 147, 124 S.Ct. 2342 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As no reasonable fact finder could find in Vega's favor, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. VETS Complaint</h2>\n<p>Vega contends that in response to the complaint he filed with VETS, Wyeth discriminated against him and took adverse employment action in violation of USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b). This court has defined an adverse employment action under Title VII as \"one that `affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions of the workplace.'\" <i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> 605 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2010)(quoting <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,</i> 548 U.S. 53, 61-62, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)) (alteration in original). The Seventh Circuit has applied a similar definition in a USERRA action. <i>See </i><i>Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon,</i> 567 F.3d 860, 869 (7th Cir.2009)(\"An adverse employment action is one that significantly alters the terms and conditions of the employee's job.\") (internal citation omitted). In the context of Title VII, the Supreme Court has held that the \"term `discriminate against' refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals.\" <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.,</i> 548 U.S. at 59, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p>Vega filed a VETS complaint in March 2007. However, Wyeth presented evidence, including an affidavit from its human resources director and the entire VETS file, which established that it did not become aware of Vega's VETS complaint until September 2007. Vega has offered no contradictory evidence. Thus any retaliatory actions necessarily had to take place after this date. As such, the only actionable events alleged by Vega based on his theory of retaliation are: (1) extension of the PIP; (2) his not being awarded salary increases in 2008 and 2009; and (3) continued name calling.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, Vega put forth evidence on which a jury could determine that the PIP was improperly extended due to his military service; however, he has presented no evidence that it was extended in response to his VETS complaint. He has significantly failed to demonstrate whether the person or persons involved in the decision to extend the PIP were even aware of the complaint.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with regards to potential salary increases in 2008 and 2009, Vega has presented no evidence of Wyeth's process or criteria for evaluating and awarding raises, or evidence of the persons responsible for making such salary determinations. In the absence of such evidence, this court cannot simply assume that Vega was entitled to a salary increase in 2008 and 2009. Nor can we assume that the persons making these compensation decisions were aware of the VETS complaint. As a result, Vega has not met his burden of demonstrating that his filing of the VETS complaint was a motivating factor in Wyeth's extension of the PIP or decision not to increase his salary, or that it generated any adverse employment action against him.</p>\n<p>With respect to the name calling, we question whether such conduct constituted an adverse employment action or discrimination in light of the meaning that courts have applied to these terms. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes,</i> 605 F.3d at 35 (An adverse employment action \"`affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions of the workplace.'\"); <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.,</i> 548 U.S. at 59, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (\"`[D]iscriminate against' refers to distinction or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals.\") However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> assuming that such comments are actionable, Vega has also failed to satisfy his burden on this issue.</p>\n<p>First, the name calling took place both before and after Vega filed the VETS complaint, with no escalation alleged after September 2007. This is a fatal flaw in Vega's argument. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Frazier v. Fairhaven School Committee,</i> 276 F.3d 52, 67 (1st Cir.2002). Further, we are persuaded by the Seventh Circuit's holding that with respect to USERRA retaliation actions, \"negative employer comments will support a retaliation claim only if they are `severe and pervasive.'\" <i>Crews,</i> 567 F.3d at 870 (internal citation omitted). Objectively viewed, the name calling directed at Vega was not, in our opinion, severe. Therefore he has failed to establish that Wyeth retaliated against him in violation of USERRA.<sup>[10]</sup> Wyeth is thus entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the above reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As will be discussed more fully, this factual dispute is not material.</p>\n<p>[2]  The reference is to the tragic April 16, 2007 shooting on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University campus in Blacksburg, Virginia where thirty-two members of the faculty and student body were killed by a lone gunman, while multiple others were injured.</p>\n<p>[3]  Vega was scheduled to return to work in February 2010. Because the lower court proceedings took place prior to this time, it is uncertain whether Vega has returned from military leave and re-assumed his position at Wyeth.</p>\n<p>[4]  Later in his deposition Vega contradicted himself by stating that he informed Figueroa of his promotion in April or May 2006 and the complaint contains a similar allegation. Before this court, Vega claims that the February date is in fact correct. Construing the evidence in Vega's favor, we find the February date to be the applicable date. Notably, because the contradictory statements were made in the complaint and Vega's deposition, this is distinguishable from instances where a party attempts to defeat summary judgment with an affidavit that contradicts previous deposition testimony without explanation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court found that Vega's attempt to introduce Figueroa's statement failed; however, it did not state on what grounds it based this finding. We see no reason why the statement would not be admissible. To the extent the district court construed it as hearsay, we disagree. Figueroa was an employee of Wyeth involved in the hiring process and thus his statement is an admission by a party-opponent and therefore an exception to the hearsay doctrine. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) (A statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \"a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Vega attempted to rebut Quiñones by submitting an affidavit in which Vega claimed that he previously testified that Quiñones said Vega was not hired for the position because he was not reliable due to his military service. Vega did not cite to any portion of his deposition testimony and this court, along with the district court, could locate no such testimony. Therefore, like the district court, we disregard Vega's allegation. <i>See </i><i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Center,</i> 103 F.3d 196, 206 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The summary judgment paradigm requires us to draw and respect only <i>reasonable</i> inferences; we need not infer that which is farfetched or fantastic.\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Before deciding the merits, the district court noted that although it would not do so, it could dismiss this claim because Vega was seeking only monetary damages and the sole remedy would be reinstatement of his pre-PIP status. We disagree. Were Vega able to prove that he lost wages in the form of a salary increase or benefits based on the PIP's extension, he could potentially recover monetary damages. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4323(d)(1)(B) (\"The court may require the employer to compensate the person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of such employer's failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  The magistrate judge who issued the report and recommendation in this matter found that Wyeth had not satisfied its burden on this issue, and recommended that summary judgment be denied on the PIP extension claim. The judge who issued the final decision, however, disagreed.</p>\n<p>[9]  The issue has only arisen twice, before the Eleventh and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals respectively, but both courts declined to decide the issue. <i>See </i><i>Dees v. Hyundai Motor Mfg. Alabama, LLC,</i> 368 Fed.Appx. 49, 53 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished); <i>Church v. City of Reno,</i> No. 97-17097, 1999 WL 65205, at *1 (9th Cir. Feb. 9, 1999) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>[10]  Vega claims that Wyeth's alleged retaliation in response to the VETS complaint not only violated USERRA but also the Puerto Rico Whistle-Blower Act (\"Law 115\"). <i>See</i> 29 LPRA §§ 194-194b. Vega's burden under Law 115 is more stringent then under USERRA, as the former requires an employee to establish not only discrimination, but that the employer's non-discriminatory reason is pretext. <i>See</i> 29 LPRA § 194a(c). As Vega failed to establish a USERRA violation, he cannot establish a Law 115 violation.</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Wyeth, and Vega timely appealed. After careful consideration, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to Vega, the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See </i><i>Bukuras v. Mueller Group, LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204143\"><a href=\"/opinion/204143/bukuras-v-mueller-group-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir.2010). The general facts pertinent to Vega's allegations are set forth below, and more detailed facts are provided when we analyze Vega's individual claims.</p>\n<p>Wyeth is a pharmaceutical company located in Puerto Rico. In 2002, Vega was hired by Wyeth as a \"packaging equipment supervisor.\" Vega was also a member of the United States Army Reserve. During his employment at Wyeth, Vega alternated between active and inactive status with the Army. Specifically, from 2002 to 2004 Vega was active and took various leaves from Wyeth for military training. From 2004 to February 2007, Vega went on inactive status and did not leave for any military training. In February 2007, Vega returned to active status and was promoted to captain with the condition that he join a military unit and participate in military <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> exercises. Vega's Army unit was mobilized in November 2007 and he has been on military leave since then.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, the position of \"reliability engineer\" became available at Wyeth and Vega applied. Vega, along with several other internal candidates, was not hired; an outside candidate was hired instead.</p>\n<p>In February 2007, Vega received a job performance evaluation from Wyeth for his 2006 employment year. Per policy, Wyeth provided all of its employees with an annual written evaluation, which included a rating of between one and five with five being the most desirable. For the years 2003 through 2005, Vega was rated a three or \"solid performer.\" For the year 2006, Vega's rating declined to a two, which signaled \"needs improvement.\" Vega disagreed with his evaluation and requested that Wyeth initiate an investigation, which it did.</p>\n<p>In April 2007, Vega filed a discrimination complaint with the United States Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and Training Service (\"VETS\"), based on Wyeth's failure to hire him for the reliability engineer position. Finding no merit to Vega's accusations, VETS denied the complaint; however, the complaint was re-instituted at a later point when Vega presented additional evidence. Vega eventually voluntarily withdrew the VETS complaint.</p>\n<p>On May 7, 2007, Vega met with Wyeth's employee relations director and site director, though what was discussed at this meeting is disputed.<sup>[1]</sup> According to Wyeth, the parties discussed the results of the investigation it conducted into Vega's 2006 performance evaluation, in particular that the investigation revealed no discriminatory acts. Vega denies such a conversation took place. Also according to Wyeth, at this meeting Vega made a threatening comment to the effect that Wyeth's site director made it easy for one to understand why massacres like the one at Virginia Tech take place.<sup>[2]</sup> Vega has no memory of such a comment.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that shortly after this meeting Wyeth restricted Vega's access to its plant. Vega, who was out on leave at the time, learned of this restriction when he attempted to enter the plant to drop off his military orders. Vega was stopped and informed by a security guard that he could not enter because Wyeth's computer database listed him as terminated. Wyeth contends that Vega was not in fact fired but concedes his access was restricted because of security concerns over his comment about the Virginia Tech massacre. Notably, Vega never received a termination letter and he continued to receive a salary and benefits.</p>\n<p>At some point, Vega returned from leave with his access to the plant restored. Then in July 2007, Vega was placed on a \"performance improvement plan\" (\"PIP\"). Per Wyeth policy, all employees who received a performance evaluation rating of two or lower were placed on a PIP. The PIP established objectives for Vega to complete within ninety days, which he timely completed. That November, Vega was informed that although he had completed the PIP's objectives, the PIP would be extended for other reasons until he returned from military service. Vega's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Army unit was mobilized that month.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Around the same time, Vega instituted the underlying action alleging past and continuing discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. Particularly, he claims Wyeth took the following improper actions: (1) failing to hire him for the reliability engineer position; (2) awarding him a low performance rating; (3) extending the PIP; (4) discharging and then reinstating him; (5) allowing a hostile work environment; and (6) retaliating against him for filing the VETS complaint. Wyeth moved for summary judgment on all of these claims, and shortly before trial its motion was granted. Final judgment was entered in Wyeth's favor and Vega timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>This court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgement de novo. <i>Pomales v.

Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. USERRA</h2>\n<p>The purpose of USERRA is to encourage non-career military service, minimize disruption based on this service, and prevent discrimination against service members. 38 U.S.C. § 4301. To this end, USERRA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</blockquote>\n<p>38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). It further provides that an employer \"may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person . . . has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded\" under USERRA. 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b). The term \"uniformed service\" means in pertinent part the Armed Forces when engaged in active duty for training. 38 U.S.C. § 4303(16).</p>\n<p>Vega contends that the alleged discriminatory and retaliatory actions taken by Wyeth were the result of his decision to return to active duty with the Army, which he ultimately did in February 2007. Wyeth urges that because Vega did not return to active duty until February 2007, he was not protected under USERRA until this date. Vega counters that the applicable date was February 2006, which is the month he was selected for the position of Army captain with the condition that he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> return to active status and also the month he informed one of his supervisors that he would be returning to active status. The district court disagreed with both parties' contentions. It found that because USERRA protects individuals who apply for active duty; the applicable date of coverage was when Vega informed his supervisors at Wyeth that he intended to apply to join an active military unit. Based on this reasoning, the court found November 2006 to be the applicable date.</p>\n<p>The initial inquiry for this court is what protected status and/or conduct served as the basis for Wyeth's allegedly improper actions. Vega claims that Wyeth's actions stemmed from his decision to apply for active duty and his resulting military service. Thus Vega's application to perform service and his subsequent membership in a uniformed service are the respective conduct and status at issue. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).</p>\n<p>The next question is when did the protected conduct and status occur. It is undisputed that Vega returned to active duty in February 2007 and thus became a member of a \"uniformed service\" for purposes of USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4303(16). The more difficult question is when did Vega \"appl[y] to perform\" active duty service for purposes of USERRA. <i>Id.</i> Construing the record carefully, we find that Vega's notification to his Wyeth supervisors that he was returning to active duty constituted such an application. While informing a supervisor of one's intent to return to service is not strictly speaking an application for service; it is only logical that USERRA coverage would be triggered at the point in time in which an employer has information about an employee on which it could base discriminatory treatment. Here Vega expressed a definite intent to return to active duty in the near future. To deny an employee who has expressed such a definite intention the protection of USERRA until his literal application for service is signed and delivered would be contrary to the stated purposes of USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4301. This conclusion is further supported by the principle that USERRA should be broadly construed in favor of military service members as its purpose is to protect such members. <i>See </i><i>Hill v. Michelin North America, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773530\"><a href=\"/opinion/773530/charley-d-hill-v-michelin-north-america-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 312-13 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing <i>Coffy v.

Wawa, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788229\"><a href=\"/opinion/788229/wanda-gordon-individually-and-as-administratrix-ad-prosequendum-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 81 (3rd Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Thus, the final question is when did Vega inform his supervisors that he was returning to active duty. As noted above, the district court found this date to be November 2006. We disagree. In November 2006, Vega did inform two of his supervisors that he was accepted into a military unit and would start performing drills. However, Vega testified at deposition that earlier, in February 2006, shortly after receiving his invitation from the Army to become a captain, he informed his supervisor Johnny Figueroa (\"Figueroa\") that he was returning to active status and there was a high possibility he would be mobilized. Wyeth has not disputed this statement. Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Vega, February 2006 is the date on which he informed his supervisors of a definite intent to return to active duty, thus triggering USERRA.<sup>[4]</sup> Because Vega's April <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> 2006 application for the reliability engineer position was the earliest action related to his claims, any alleged improper conduct by Wyeth necessarily took place after USERRA was triggered.</p>\n<p>Now we turn to the merits, particularly whether Vega's application for service and his resulting military service formed the basis for any of Wyeth's allegedly improper actions. In assessing a USERRA claim, the burden is on Vega to make an initial showing that his military status \"was at least a motivating or substantial factor in [Wyeth's] action.\" <i>Velázquez-García v. Horizon Lines of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202583\"><a href=\"/opinion/202583/velazquez-garcia-v-horizon-lines-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2007) (internal citation omitted); <i>see also</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1)-(c)(2). If Vega can make this showing, the burden then shifts to Wyeth to \"prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\" <i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 17. We address each of Vega's claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Reliability Engineer Position</h2>\n<p>Vega avers that Wyeth's failure to hire him for the reliability engineer position violated USERRA. USERRA prohibits an employer from denying an employee a \"promotion\" based on the protected factors relating to military service. 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). Though Wyeth claims that the reliability engineer position did not constitute a direct promotion, it concedes that the position carried higher pay, bonuses, and increased benefits  typical indicia of a promotion. Construing the statute broadly in Vega's favor, we find the reliability engineer position was a promotion for purposes of USERRA.</p>\n<p>Regarding Wyeth's motives for not hiring Vega for the position and instead hiring outside candidate Gloryvee Ramos (\"Ramos\"), Vega presented little evidence. While Vega had some knowledge about the position's requirements, he did not know who else applied for the position, those persons' qualifications, or why Wyeth recruited Ramos. What Vega did know was that his supervisors, Figueroa and Reinaldo Quiñones (\"Quiñones\"), were part of a panel that participated in the decision to hire Ramos. Vega further alleges that Figueroa informed him that he did not recommend Ramos because she was weak in the maintenance area.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, Vega expressed via affidavit a belief that he was better qualified than Ramos. Wyeth, on the other hand, put forth affidavit evidence from Figueroa and Quiñones that Ramos was selected for the position because she was the strongest candidate.<sup>[6]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> Figueroa also stated, contrary to Vega's assertion, that he personally recommended Ramos and agreed with the decision to hire her.</p>\n<p>The contradictory evidence does raise an issue as to whether Figueroa in fact recommended Ramos for the position. Nonetheless, the inner workings of the hiring panel are not relevant, so long as Vega's military status was not a motivating or substantial factor in Wyeth's decision not to hire him. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 17. Vega has put forth no evidence that it was, essentially relying only on his personal belief that he was more qualified. Vega's subjective belief is insufficient. <i>See </i><i>Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757726\"><a href=\"/opinion/757726/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-736-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45576-peter-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1998) (An employee's \"personal opinion regarding his own job qualifications is not sufficiently probative on the issue of pretext\" in an employment discrimination action.). Vega is required to \"show evidence of discrimination other than the fact of non-selection and membership in the protected class.\" <i>Sheehan v. Department of Navy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span>, 1015 (Fed.Cir.2001). He has not done so. As Vega has not satisfied his burden, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Low Performance Rating/Performance Improvement Plan</h2>\n<p>Vega next contends that his level two 2006 performance rating, which resulted in his being placed on a PIP, was given in violation of USERRA. USERRA prohibits an employer from improperly denying \"any benefit of employment.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). A \"benefit of employment\" is defined to include \"any advantage ... that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4303(2).</p>\n<p>Here Wyeth's employee relations director put forth affidavit evidence that employees who received a low performance rating, and were consequently placed on a PIP, were not eligible to apply to other internal positions until the PIP was completed. Further, the PIP itself stated that such employees were subject to disciplinary action and termination for failure to complete the PIP. Construing USERRA's definition of \"benefit of employment\" broadly, we find that the ability to seek additional employment within the company, and the freedom from the threat of discipline or termination based on failure to complete the PIP, do constitute \"advantage[s].\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, Vega has raised an actionable claim with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p>However, Vega must also make the requisite showing under USERRA that his military status was a motivating factor in Wyeth's decision to award the low performance rating. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). In support of his claim, Vega contends that: (1) he was never subject to any disciplinary action before receiving the low rating; (2) his rating was higher the previous year; and (3) he had recently informed his supervisor, Gilberto Inserni (\"Inserni\"), who issued the rating, about his military leave. Thus, Vega avers his military service was a motivating factor in the issuance of the low rating. We find these arguments unpersuasive. First, Vega has presented no evidence that a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> disciplinary action must precede a low performance rating. Nor has he demonstrated that employee ratings cannot change from year to year as reflective of a change in that employee's work performance. Finally, though the proximity in time between Vega informing Inserni of his leave and his receipt of the low rating is a factor for consideration, it alone is not sufficient. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 19 (finding that proximity in time between military service and an adverse action is not an \"exclusive test\").</p>\n<p>Assuming arguendo that temporal proximity is sufficient to satisfy Vega's burden, Wyeth put forth evidence that it would have given Vega a low rating and implemented a PIP regardless of his military membership. In particular, the PIP itself documented Vega's various employee performance issues, including his argumentative behavior, failure to address equipment reliability issues, and failure to timely address assignments. Vega did not specifically rebut these findings, but generally disagreed with his review and believed himself an excellent employee. Moreover, responding to Vega's allegations of discriminatory treatment and request for an investigation into his low rating, Wyeth's human resources director and associate director each conducted an investigation, which included multiple meetings with Vega and the gathering of information. Wyeth concluded that the rating should stand and that it was not the result of discriminatory acts.</p>\n<p>Other than proximity in time, Vega has not come forth with any evidence that his military status was a motivating factor in Wyeth awarding him the low performance rating and implementing the PIP. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). Furthermore, Wyeth has sufficiently established that it would have taken such action regardless of Vega's military membership. <i>Id.</i> In light of the above, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Performance Improvement Plan Extension</h2>\n<p>Even if the PIP itself can be deemed valid, Vega claims that Wyeth's extension of the PIP was an improper discriminatory action. For the same reasons the low performance rating and implementation of the PIP could constitute a denial of an employment benefit under USERRA; so too could the PIP's extension. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4303(2) (defining a \"benefit of employment\" as \"any advantage ... that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice\"). Vega has therefore raised a cognizable USERRA claim and we turn to the merits of his argument.</p>\n<p>In our review of the record, the following was established as to the PIP's extension. The PIP itself stated that although Vega completed the set goals, it was being extended because of: (1) an email Vega sent in which he described a supervisor in a disrespectful manner; (2) a letter Vega improperly solicited his co-workers to sign attesting to his job performance; and (3) Vega's authorized leave. The PIP was to remain open for at least three months after Vega returned from leave so that positive behavior and work habits could be verified. Additionally, Vega testified that one of his supervisors, Andrew Espejo (\"Espejo\"), informed him that he did not pass the PIP because his performance was affected by his military service.</p>\n<p>Based on the above facts, the district court found that Vega satisfied the first prong under USERRA, particularly his burden of demonstrating that his military service was a motivating factor in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Wyeth's actions.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). We agree. Both Espejo's comments, and the language contained in the PIP attributing the extension to Vega's leave, satisfied his burden on this issue.</p>\n<p>The district court then moved to the second prong-Wyeth's burden to demonstrate that it would have extended the PIP in the absence of Vega's military status. <i>Id.</i> The court found that Wyeth satisfied this burden and was therefore entitled to summary judgment.<sup>[8]</sup> In finding for Wyeth, the court relied on Vega's disrespectful email and the inappropriate letter he circulated. Additionally, the court believed that Wyeth was generally entitled to extend a PIP when an employee was on leave during a portion of it. This reasoning is not persuasive.</p>\n<p>First, while the email and letter may be sufficient grounds on which Wyeth could base the PIP's extension, the inquiry is not whether Wyeth was entitled to extend the PIP, but whether such \"action would have been taken in the absence of [Vega's military] membership.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 20 (holding that with respect to employee termination, \"[t]he issue under USERRA is not whether an employer is `entitled' to dismiss an employee for a particular reason, but whether it would have done so if the employee were not in the military\"). Specifically, Wyeth must \"demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it <i>would</i> indeed have\" extended the PIP regardless of Vega's military service. <i>Velázquez-García,</i> 473 F.3d at 20.</p>\n<p>Here the PIP itself stated that Vega successfully completed its objectives prior to Wyeth's extending it. Further, Espejo purportedly remarked that Vega did not pass the PIP due to his military service. Notably, Wyeth has not rebutted this assertion. Given the PIP's language and the testimony concerning Espejo's comment, there \"is sufficient doubt on this issue to make it a jury question.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Sensing v. Outback Steakhouse of Florida, LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203950\"><a href=\"/opinion/203950/sensing-v-outback-steakhouse-of-florida-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2004)) (In instances where \"the record contains inconsistencies `that favor in some lights the defendant[] and in others the plaintiff,' as long as the `plaintiff's evidence is both cognizable and sufficiently strong to support a verdict in [his] favor, the factfinder must be allowed to determine which version of the facts is most compelling.'\").</p>\n<p>Further, the district court's finding that Wyeth would have extended the PIP for any employee on leave  whether it be military leave, sick leave, or otherwise  is not relevant. The fact that Wyeth may have treated other absences similarly does not overcome the fact that it may have based its treatment of Vega, at least in part, on his military absences. <i>See </i><i>Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"208407\"><a href=\"/opinion/208407/erickson-v-us-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1368 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> (Fed.Cir.2009) (\"An employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service.\").</p>\n<p>We hold that the evidence is sufficiently strong that a reasonable jury could find in Vega's favor; therefore, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Facility Access Denial</h2>\n<p>Next Vega contends that Wyeth wrongfully discharged and then reinstated him while he was away on military leave. This claim is based on the incident in which Vega attempted to enter Wyeth's plant but was turned away by a security guard. Wyeth admits that it restricted Vega's access over security concerns but denies that it terminated Vega. We find that Vega has failed to raise a cognizable claim with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p>Though there is some factual dispute surrounding this claim, such dispute is immaterial. Specifically, it is irrelevant whether Vega's access to the plant was restricted in response to an alleged comment about the Virginia Tech massacre or not. \"To be considered material, a disputed fact must have the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\" <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199925\"><a href=\"/opinion/199925/rochester-ford-sales-v-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal citation omitted). In this case, why Vega's access was restricted does not affect the outcome of this suit. What is relevant is this  the evidence conclusively demonstrated that while Vega's access to the plant was restricted on that one occasion, he was not terminated from employment. Most notably, he continued to receive a salary and benefits, and never received a termination letter. For this court to conclude that Vega was terminated solely based on a comment by a security guard, which may have been incorrect or misconstrued, would require us to draw an improbable inference. \"Although employment discrimination cases deal with elusive concepts such as motive or intent,\" summary judgment is compelled \"if the non-moving party rests his case merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203075\"><a href=\"/opinion/203075/mariani-colon-v-dept-of-homeland-sec/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 221 (1st Cir.2007) (internal citation omitted). Thus Vega was not denied \"retention in employment\" pursuant to USERRA. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a).</p>\n<p>Further, Vega's restricted access to the plant cannot be deemed a denial of a \"benefit of employment\" because he was on leave at the time and had no need to access the plant. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. §§ 4303(2), 4311(a). Nor can it constitute an \"adverse employment action\" in retaliation for Vega's VETS complaint, because the incident took place prior to Wyeth's learning about the complaint. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4311(b). As Vega has failed to set forth an actionable claim based on this one incidence of restricted access, Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. Hostile Work Environment</h2>\n<p>Vega alleges that dating back to October 2006, he was subjected to comments and name calling by various Wyeth supervisors, related to his military service. Specifically, on one occasion Inserni asked Vega whether his military training was similar to the American military movie \"Rambo.\" Additionally, Quiñones expressed disagreement with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a sentiment which Vega admittedly heard often and in fact agreed with. Quiñones also once questioned Vega about his status with the military, an inquiry Vega admitted was reasonable for a supervisor to make. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Further, Inserni and Quiñones repeatedly referred to Vega as \"soldier\", \"little soldier\", \"sergeant\", and \"Rolandito.\" Another supervisor, Antonio Otano, also referred to Vega as \"Rolandito.\" This moniker, referring to a famous missing boy in Puerto Rico, was taken by Vega to be a negative commentary on his absences for military service. Vega concedes that this suspicion was not based on anything he was told and in fact he often took leave for reasons other than military service. From Vega's vantage he found the above comments discriminatory and derogatory and he sought psychiatric help, in part, he says, based on the work environment at Wyeth.</p>\n<p>Neither the Supreme Court nor any court of appeals has decided whether a hostile work environment claim is cognizable under USERRA.<sup>[9]</sup> For purposes of this decision we assume, without deciding, that it is. In order to establish a hostile work environment, Vega \"must show harassing behavior `sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment.'\" <i>Pennsylvania State Police v.

However, Wyeth presented evidence, including an affidavit from its human resources director and the entire VETS file, which established that it did not become aware of Vega's VETS complaint until September 2007. Vega has offered no contradictory evidence. Thus any retaliatory actions necessarily had to take place after this date. As such, the only actionable events alleged by Vega based on his theory of retaliation are: (1) extension of the PIP; (2) his not being awarded salary increases in 2008 and 2009; and (3) continued name calling.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, Vega put forth evidence on which a jury could determine that the PIP was improperly extended due to his military service; however, he has presented no evidence that it was extended in response to his VETS complaint. He has significantly failed to demonstrate whether the person or persons involved in the decision to extend the PIP were even aware of the complaint.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with regards to potential salary increases in 2008 and 2009, Vega has presented no evidence of Wyeth's process or criteria for evaluating and awarding raises, or evidence of the persons responsible for making such salary determinations. In the absence of such evidence, this court cannot simply assume that Vega was entitled to a salary increase in 2008 and 2009. Nor can we assume that the persons making these compensation decisions were aware of the VETS complaint. As a result, Vega has not met his burden of demonstrating that his filing of the VETS complaint was a motivating factor in Wyeth's extension of the PIP or decision not to increase his salary, or that it generated any adverse employment action against him.</p>\n<p>With respect to the name calling, we question whether such conduct constituted an adverse employment action or discrimination in light of the meaning that courts have applied to these terms. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes,</i> 605 F.3d at 35 (An adverse employment action \"`affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions of the workplace.'\"); <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

This is a fatal flaw in Vega's argument. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Frazier v. Fairhaven School Committee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776058\"><a href=\"/opinion/776058/kate-frazier-v-fairhaven-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2002). Further, we are persuaded by the Seventh Circuit's holding that with respect to USERRA retaliation actions, \"negative employer comments will support a retaliation claim only if they are `severe and pervasive.'\" <i>Crews,</i> 567 F.3d at 870 (internal citation omitted). Objectively viewed, the name calling directed at Vega was not, in our opinion, severe. Therefore he has failed to establish that Wyeth retaliated against him in violation of USERRA.<sup>[10]</sup> Wyeth is thus entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the above reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As will be discussed more fully, this factual dispute is not material.</p>\n<p>[2]  The reference is to the tragic April 16, 2007 shooting on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University campus in Blacksburg, Virginia where thirty-two members of the faculty and student body were killed by a lone gunman, while multiple others were injured.</p>\n<p>[3]  Vega was scheduled to return to work in February 2010. Because the lower court proceedings took place prior to this time, it is uncertain whether Vega has returned from military leave and re-assumed his position at Wyeth.</p>\n<p>[4]  Later in his deposition Vega contradicted himself by stating that he informed Figueroa of his promotion in April or May 2006 and the complaint contains a similar allegation. Before this court, Vega claims that the February date is in fact correct. Construing the evidence in Vega's favor, we find the February date to be the applicable date. Notably, because the contradictory statements were made in the complaint and Vega's deposition, this is distinguishable from instances where a party attempts to defeat summary judgment with an affidavit that contradicts previous deposition testimony without explanation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court found that Vega's attempt to introduce Figueroa's statement failed; however, it did not state on what grounds it based this finding. We see no reason why the statement would not be admissible. To the extent the district court construed it as hearsay, we disagree. Figueroa was an employee of Wyeth involved in the hiring process and thus his statement is an admission by a party-opponent and therefore an exception to the hearsay doctrine. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) (A statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \"a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Vega attempted to rebut Quiñones by submitting an affidavit in which Vega claimed that he previously testified that Quiñones said Vega was not hired for the position because he was not reliable due to his military service. Vega did not cite to any portion of his deposition testimony and this court, along with the district court, could locate no such testimony. Therefore, like the district court, we disregard Vega's allegation. <i>See </i><i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Center,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732304\"><a href=\"/opinion/732304/the-international-association-of-machinists-and-aerospace-workers-afl-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 206 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The summary judgment paradigm requires us to draw and respect only <i>reasonable</i> inferences; we need not infer that which is farfetched or fantastic.\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Before deciding the merits, the district court noted that although it would not do so, it could dismiss this claim because Vega was seeking only monetary damages and the sole remedy would be reinstatement of his pre-PIP status. We disagree. Were Vega able to prove that he lost wages in the form of a salary increase or benefits based on the PIP's extension, he could potentially recover monetary damages. <i>See</i> 38 U.S.C. § 4323(d)(1)(B) (\"The court may require the employer to compensate the person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of such employer's failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  The magistrate judge who issued the report and recommendation in this matter found that Wyeth had not satisfied its burden on this issue, and recommended that summary judgment be denied on the PIP extension claim. The judge who issued the final decision, however, disagreed.</p>\n<p>[9]  The issue has only arisen twice, before the Eleventh and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals respectively, but both courts declined to decide the issue. <i>See </i><i>Dees v. Hyundai Motor Mfg. Alabama, LLC,</i> 368 Fed.Appx. 49, 53 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished); <i>Church v. City of Reno,</i> No. 97-17097, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">65205</span></span>, at *1 (9th Cir. Feb. 9, 1999) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>[10]  Vega claims that Wyeth's alleged retaliation in response to the VETS complaint not only violated USERRA but also the Puerto Rico Whistle-Blower Act (\"Law 115\"). <i>See</i> 29 LPRA §§ 194-194b. Vega's burden under Law 115 is more stringent then under USERRA, as the former requires an employee to establish not only discrimination, but that the employer's non-discriminatory reason is pretext. <i>See</i> 29 LPRA § 194a(c). As Vega failed to establish a USERRA violation, he cannot establish a Law 115 violation.</p>\n\n</div>",
