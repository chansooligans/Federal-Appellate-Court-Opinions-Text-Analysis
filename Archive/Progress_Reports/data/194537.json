Jesus Penaloza Clemente  (\"Penaloza\")\n                    \n\napplied for  Social  Security disability  benefits,  alleging\n\ndisability  due to  back and  leg injury  and nerves.   In  a\n\nDisability Report,  he further  stated that he  suffered from\n\nhigh blood pressure.   After  a hearing, the  ALJ denied  his\n\nclaim,  but  the Appeals  Council  vacated  the decision  and\n\nremanded for further testimony on pain.  After a supplemental\n\nhearing, the  ALJ again  denied Penaloza's application.   The\n\nALJ found  that Penaloza  had severe hypertension,  which was\n\ncontrolled  with  medication,  and  that  he  had   undergone\n\narthroscopic removal  of torn cartilage in  both knees before\n\nMarch  31,  1988,  the  date  when  his  disability  coverage\n\nexpired,  but that those conditions did not meet or equal any\n\nlisting  in  20  C.F.R.  Part 404,  Subpart  P,  Appendix  1.\n\nAlthough  the  ALJ  determined  that Penaloza  had  \"mild  to\n\nmoderate occasional  pain\" in  both knees, he  concluded that\n\nthe pain was relieved by medication and that the pain did not\n\nreduce  Penaloza's residual  functional  capacity.   Penaloza\n\ncould not return to  his former work as security  guard since\n\nhe could  not stand or walk for more than two hours during an\n\neight-hour work day and  could not use his legs  for constant\n\nrepetitive  movement.    However,  the   ALJ  concluded  that\n\nPenaloza  could  sit and  use  his  arms without  limitation.\n\nFinding that Penaloza had no nonexertional limitations,  that\n\nhe  could perform  sedentary  work, and  that his  vocational\n\nattributes fit the criteria  of Rule 201.25 in Appendix  2 of\n\nthe regulations, the ALJ determined that Rule 201.25 directed\n\na  conclusion  that  Penaloza  was not  disabled.    Penaloza\n\nappealed the ALJ's denial of benefits to the district  court,\n\nwhich  affirmed the ALJ's decision.  He then sought review in\n\nthis court.  We affirm.  \n\n          I.  Allegations of Pain\n                                 \n\n          Penaloza does not challenge the ALJ's determination\n\nthat his  knee condition  and hypertension  did  not meet  or\n\nequal any listing  in the regulations.   He claims,  however,\n\nthat  the ALJ  failed to  consider  his allegations  of pain,\n\nasserting that  he complained \"constantly and persistently to\n\nthe examining  physicians of severe disabling pain.\"   In his\n\ndecision,  the ALJ  noted that  Penaloza did  have knee  pain\n\nduring  the  coverage  period as  a  result  of  a fall  that\n\noccurred  on April 24, 1987.   The ALJ  found that Penaloza's\n\npain responded to treatment, however, and that as of April 6,\n\n1988,  one week  after Penaloza's coverage  expired, Penaloza\n\nwas experiencing no pain  when his knees were palpated.   The\n\nALJ further characterized the pain that Penaloza had suffered\n\nto be of \"moderate character\"  which was relieved by physical\n\ntherapy  and  \"mild analgesics  of  a  non-narcotic character\n\nwhich did not cause  any side effect[s].\"  Apparently  on the\n\nbasis  of Penaloza's testimony at the  hearings, the ALJ also\n\nfound that  Penaloza \"may  experience discomfort and  mild to\n\n                             -3-\n\nmoderate  pain on an occasional basis and it [is] relieved by\n\nthe use of non-narcotic analgesics.\"  Penaloza's      medical\n\nrecords  fully support the ALJ's findings as to the nature of\n\nPenaloza's pain  for the period before  his coverage expired.\n\nThe  records document  that  Penaloza complained  of pain  to\n\nexamining physicians  and to his physical  therapist a number\n\nof  times after his fall.  His complaints occurred even after\n\nthe torn menisci (fibrocartilage)  in both knees were removed\n\narthroscopically.   In  all instances  but one,  however, the\n\nreports state merely that  he reported \"pain\" or \"discomfort\"\n\nor that one or the other of  his knees \"hurt.\"  Only once, in\n\nOctober  1987, within  weeks of  his surgery,  did he  report\n\n\"intense pain,\" and that was to his physical therapist  about\n\nhis right knee.   The pain appears to have  resulted from the\n\nspecific exercise he was  performing during therapy that day.\n\nA  subsequent report in November 1987 stated that he had full\n\nrange  of movement in both knees \"without pain.\"  The records\n\ncontain no further report of pain in his right knee, although\n\nin December 1987 he  reported to his physical  therapist that\n\nthe pain in his left  knee had increased and in January  1988\n\nhe reported to the therapist that his left knee \"continues to\n\nhurt.\"  For the  two-month period between the end  of January\n\nand expiration  of his coverage  on March 31,  1988, however,\n\nthere are no further reports of  pain.  On April 6, 1988, his\n\nphysician reported that he had \"no pain on palpation.\"  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          Most of Penaloza's testimony during the hearings in\n\nOctober  1989  and  June  1990  described  the  pain  he  was\n\nexperiencing  at that time.  Since he had reinjured his knees\n\nin  a fall on March 30, 1989,  before the hearings and a year\n\nafter his coverage  had expired, that testimony  is of little\n\nrelevance  in  determining  his  degree of  pain  during  the\n\ncoverage  period.   (The  ALJ  did  consider that  testimony,\n\nhowever, and determined, as the above summary of his findings\n\nindicates, that  at the  time of  the  hearings Penaloza  was\n\nexperiencing  occasional  mild  to  moderate  pain  which was\n\nrelieved by analgesics.)  \n\n          Some of  Penaloza's testimony did describe his pain\n\nduring the  coverage period  after  his first  fall in  April\n\n1987.   Penaloza explained \"that a toothache would be more or\n\nless the  same\" as the pain he  then experienced.  When asked\n\nto describe the  intensity of the pain, he stated that it was\n\n\"a continuous pain, very strong.\"  He  further testified that\n\nhe told his doctor that he \"could no longer stand the  pain,\"\n\nand  that his  doctor  then recommended  the menisectomy,  or\n\narthroscopic  removal  of  menisci, which  was  performed  in\n\nOctober 1987.  As noted above, although Penaloza continued to\n\nreport  pain  after the  surgery,  he last  reported  pain in\n\nJanuary 1988, and, by  April 1988, he experienced no  pain in\n\neither  knee.  At the hearings,  Penaloza also testified that\n\nhe needed a  cane to walk,  and that he  had received a  cane\n\n                             -5-\n\nfrom  the  State Insurance  Fund.   The medical  records show\n\nthat, several weeks after he fell, he received a prescription\n\nfor a wheelchair from the Fund,  but not that a cane was ever\n\nprescribed or  determined  to  be  medically  necessary  (the\n\nmedical reports  note, however, that he  came to appointments\n\nusing a cane).  \n\n          At the hearings, Penaloza  identified Motrin as one\n\nof  the medications  he was  then taking  and stated  that it\n\nrelieved his pain \"all the time.\"  At  the first hearing, the\n\nALJ also named two other medications -- Indocin and Medrol --\n\nas  being on  a  list that  Penaloza  had submitted  to  him.\n\nMotrin is  a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory analgesic used to\n\nreduce  swelling and  pain.    See  Houts, Baselt  &amp;  Cravey,\n                                  \n\nCourtroom Toxicology (1992) (under  \"Ibuprofen\").  Indocin is\n                    \n\nan  anti-inflammatory  analgesic,   see  The   Sloane-Dorland\n                                                             \n\nAnnotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 373 (1987), and  Medrol is\n                                  \n\nan  anti-inflammatory,  see  Dorland's   Illustrated  Medical\n                                                             \n\nDictionary  993, 1028  (27th  ed. 1988).   Although  Penaloza\n          \n\ntestified that  the pain \"does not  disappear completely,\" he\n\nconfirmed that  the medication  made it possible  for him  to\n\nmove  around.   At  the first  hearing  he suggested  that an\n\nunidentified medicine  which he took at night  to \"relax\" may\n\nhave  caused him  some sleeplessness,  but that  otherwise he\n\nsuffered no side effects from his medications.  At the second\n\nhearing, he testified  that some medications  -- he may  have\n\n                             -6-\n\nbeen  referring  to Medrol  and Indocin  which were  the only\n\nmedications  named besides  Motrin --  caused nausea,  but no\n\ndrowsiness.  At  the hearings, Penaloza did  not identify the\n\nmedications  he took  during his coverage  period, but  in an\n\nundated document entitled \"Claimant's Statement  When Request\n\nfor Hearing  is Filed\", filled  out presumably  in 1989  when\n\nPenaloza  requested  a   hearing,  Penaloza  identified   the\n\nfollowing medications as the prescription drugs he was taking\n\nat  that  time:    Feldene,  Tolectin,   Naprosyn,  Flexeril,\n\nClinoril, and  Minipress.1   With the exception  of Minipress\n\nand  Flexeril,  all  of  those  drugs  are  anti-inflammatory\n\nanalgesics.2     See  id.  (under   \"Piroxicam\",  \"Tolmetin\",\n                         \n\n\"Naproxen\",    and    \"Sulindac\").       Unfortunately,   the\n\nprescriptions given in the medical  records for the period of\n\ncoverage  are  often   illegible,  but   the  following   are\n\nidentifiable:      Motrin,   Feldene,    Naprosyn,   Indocin,\n\nButazolidin, Darvocet,  and Clinoril.  Darvocet  is a \"mildly\n\neffective  narcotic  analgesic\"  used  to  relieve  \"mild  to\n\nmoderate  pain.\"   See  Courtroom  Toxicology,  supra  (under\n                                                     \n\n\"Propoxyphene).      Butazolidin   is  an   anti-inflammatory\n\n                    \n\n1.  Penaloza also identified \"Asolid\",  but it appears not to\nbe  referenced  in  the   Physicians  Desk  Reference  or  in\nPenaloza's medical records.  \n\n2.  Minipress  is   a   hypertension  drug,   see   Courtroom\n                                                             \nToxicology, supra (under the entry \"Prazosin\"),  and Flexeril\n                 \nis  a skeletal  muscle  relaxant used  for  relief of  muscle\nspasms   associated   with   acute,   painful   muscoskeletal\nconditions, see id. (under \"Cyclobenzaprine\").  \n                   \n\n                             -7-\n\nanalgesic.    See Dorland's  Illustrated  Medical Dictionary,\n                                                             \n\nsupra, at 248, 1278.\n     \n\n          Thus, the  medical record and  Penaloza's testimony\n\nprovide  substantial evidence  for the ALJ's  conclusion that\n\nPenaloza's  pain   during  the   coverage  period  had   been\n\n\"moderate\" and that it had been relieved by  physical therapy\n\nand  analgesics by the time his coverage expired.  In support\n\nof his conclusion that Penaloza's  pain had been relieved  by\n\nanalgesics   of   a   \"non-narcotic   character,\"   the   ALJ\n\nspecifically  identified records  from  the  coverage  period\n\nwhich  prescribed Butazolidin, Feldene,  Motrin and Naprosyn.\n\n(He also  referred to  the Claimant's Statement  which listed\n\nthe  medications  taken  in   1989  and  an  exhibit  listing\n\nmedications  taken in  1990, including  Indocin.)   As stated\n\nabove,  Motrin  is a  non-narcotic analgesic,  which provided\n\nPenaloza  the greatest pain relief,  at least as  of the time\n\nthe  hearings were held.   The other analgesic  drugs the ALJ\n\nreferred  to all  appear to  have been non-narcotic  as well.\n\nAlthough  the  ALJ  did  not  mention Darvocet,  which  is  a\n\nnarcotic  analgesic, that  medication  appears  to have  been\n\nprescribed only once when Penaloza began physical therapy.  \n\n          The ALJ also  stated that  the analgesics  Penaloza\n\ntook had no side effects.  His conclusion is supported by the\n\nmedical records, which contain no report of any side effects.\n\nAlthough Penaloza  testified to some side  effects during the\n\n                             -8-\n\nhearings, his testimony was not very probative.  It concerned\n\nmedications  administered during  1989 and  1990 and  did not\n\nidentify which medications  had caused the side  effects.  In\n\naddition,   although  some  of  those  medications  had  been\n\nprescribed  during the  coverage  period,  the  testimony  on\n\nadverse side  effects can fairly  be said to  have implicated\n\nonly  Indocin, which was named  during the second hearing and\n\nwas also prescribed once during the period of coverage.  \n\n          The ALJ's  decision made  no reference to  the back\n\ninjury  which  Penaloza  claimed  disabled  him  during   the\n\ncoverage period.    However,  after  discussing  evidence  of\n\nPenaloza's knee  injuries, pain and high  blood pressure, the\n\nALJ commented that the remaining evidence related only to the\n\ntime  after Penaloza's  coverage  had expired.   Because  the\n\nmedical records for the coverage period contain no reports of\n\nback  pain or evaluation of any back condition, we infer that\n\nthe  ALJ   considered  and  rejected   Penaloza's  claim   of\n\ndisability due to back injury or pain.  In the recitation  of\n\nfacts in  his appellate  brief, Penaloza describes  a medical\n\nrecord  from June  1988, which  refers to  \"disabling painful\n\nresiduals, specially of the  back.\"  But the ALJ  did not err\n\nin not considering  that record.   Not only  does the  record\n\ndescribe  a condition existing  three months after Penaloza's\n\ncoverage expired, but, more  importantly, it appears to refer\n\nto  a different  patient altogether.   The  patient  with the\n\n                             -9-\n\npainful  back had also had his legs amputated, and thus could\n\nnot  have been  Penaloza.   A record  from July  1988 further\n\nindicates that the records of a patient with a back condition\n\nhad  inadvertently been  placed in  Penaloza's file,  and the\n\nJune 1988  report is  likely to have  been that record.   The\n\nmedical records  which do describe Penaloza's  back condition\n\nall pertain  to evaluations  made months after  expiration of\n\nthe coverage period.\n\n          At his  first hearing, Penaloza stated  that he had\n\ncomplained to his physical therapist of  back pain.  Although\n\nhis testimony  suggests  that  his  complaints  had  occurred\n\nduring therapy  in 1987 during  the coverage period,  he also\n\nstated that  the therapy took place at  the \"Medical Center\".\n\nBut  he was  not treated  at the  Medical Center  until 1989,\n\nafter expiration  of the  coverage period.   Furthermore, the\n\nphysical  therapist's  notes  from  1987  reflect  Penaloza's\n\ncomplaints  of knee  pain, but  do not  mention that  he ever\n\ncomplained  of  back  pain.    Therefore,  the  record  amply\n\nsupports the conclusion that  Penaloza did not suffer  from a\n\ndisabling back injury or pain during the coverage period. \n\n          II.  Appropriateness of Sedentary Work\n                                                \n\n          Penaloza argues that  the ALJ's determination  that\n\nhe  could perform sedentary work was wrong because it had not\n\nbeen  shown that  he  could perform  sedentary work  \"without\n\nserious  aggravation to  his  present  physical  impairment.\"\n\n                             -10-\n\nPenaloza does not state whether he  means his hypertension or\n\nhis  knee  condition  by  the  term   \"physical  impairment.\"\n\nHowever, as long  as the finding that  Penaloza could perform\n\nsedentary  work  is   consistent  with  the   evidence  about\n\nPenaloza's residual functional  capacity (\"RFC\"),  presumably\n\nsedentary work would not aggravate either condition.  \n\n          The  record  contains substantial  support  for the\n\nALJ's conclusion that Penaloza could safely perform sedentary\n\nwork  as  of  March  31,  1988.    Three  uncontradicted  RFC\n\nassessments by non-examining  Social Security physicians  are\n\nin  the record,  one evaluating Penaloza's  hypertension, the\n\nother  two his  knee condition.   Penaloza  submitted no  RFC\n\nassessment, although  the ALJ gave him opportunity  to do so.\n\nThe  report   assessing  Penaloza's   RFC  in  view   of  his\n\nhypertension stated:   \"Diagnosis hypertension.  Hospitalized\n\nin Jan  '88 because  of hypertensive  crisis.  Rt  hemiplegia\n\ndescribed  but no  detailed neurologic  exam.   No CT  of the\n\nbrain.   More recent evaluation = no neurologic deficit.  EKG\n\n=  left axis deviation.  Non specific  ST-T changes.  Chest x\n\nRay = cardiomegaly.  Heavy work activity should be precluded.\n\nRFC:   medium  work.\"3     The   assessment  also   evaluated\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  RFC mistakenly  states that  Penaloza's hypertensive\ncrisis occurred in January 1988, which would have been during\nthe coverage  period.   The consulting physician's  confusion\nundoubtedly arose  because  some of  the handwritten  records\nrelating  to  Penaloza's  hospitalization   erroneously  give\nJanuary  5, 1988 as his hospitalization date.  Other records,\nincluding  some  stamped  by   a  dating  device,  which  are\n\n                             -11-\n\nPenaloza's  exertional  capabilities by  checking appropriate\n\nspaces  on the RFC form.  It indicated that, despite strength\n\nlimitations imposed by his hypertension, Penaloza could  lift\n\nand  carry 50 pounds and frequently lift and carry 25 pounds,\n\nand that  he could  stand, walk and  sit about six  hours per\n\neight-hour day and push or pull up  to 50 pounds using either\n\nfoot  or  hand  controls.     According  to  the  assessment,\n\nPenaloza's hypertension did not  affect his ability to climb,\n\nbalance, stoop,  kneel, crouch, crawl or engage in fine motor\n\nactivities.     \n\n          On March  1, 1989,  Dr.  Irizarry Rivera  described\n\nPenaloza's  knee  condition  as  follows:    \"Bilateral  torn\n\nmenisci.   [B]oth knees  repaired arthroscopically  by 10/87.\n\n[T]reated  [with]  physic[al]  therapy,  had  recurrent  knee\n\neffusions  which subsided  by  4/88 &amp;  painless  knees.\"   He\n\nassessed  Penaloza's strength  limitations  by  checking  the\n\nappropriate spaces,  concluding  that Penaloza  retained  the\n\ncapacity to lift  and carry  up to 50  pounds, to  frequently\n\nlift and carry up to 25 pounds, to sit, stand  and walk about\n\n                    \n\ninterspersed  with  the erroneous  handwritten  records, make\nclear  that the  hypertensive crisis  occurred on  January 5,\n1989,  after   the  coverage   period  had  expired.     (The\nhandwritten error appears to reflect the fact that a new year\nhad  just begun and the person writing  down the date had not\nyet become accustomed  to writing \"1989\".)   The \"more recent\nevaluation[s]\", including the results of the EKG and chest X-\nray, which  were referred to  in the  RFC, actually  predated\nPenaloza's hypertensive  crisis and were  within the coverage\nperiod.  \n\n                             -12-\n\nsix hours per eight-hour day, and to push and pull using foot\n\ncontrols up to \"50/25 [pounds].\" (By  implication, Penaloza's\n\nability to push and  pull hand controls was unlimited.)   Dr.\n\nIrizarry  further indicated  that Penaloza could  balance and\n\nstoop frequently, although he  could climb, kneel, crouch and\n\ncrawl  only  occasionally, and  that  his  fine motor  skills\n\n(reaching, handling, fingering, feeling) were unimpaired.  On\n\nJune 14, 1989, Dr.  Acevedo Defillo described Penaloza's knee\n\ncondition  in almost  the same  words as  Dr. Irizarry.   His\n\nassessment  of Penaloza's  physical capacity  was essentially\n\nthe same as Dr. Irizarry's except that he found that Penaloza\n\ncould push and pull both hand and foot controls  \"[t]o 50 lbs\n\nmax.\"  Dr. Acevedo also found that Penaloza could balance and\n\nstoop  frequently, and  climb, kneel,  crouch and  crawl only\n\noccasionally.   He found Penaloza's  fine motor skills  to be\n\nunimpaired.  Thus,  there was basic agreement between the two\n\nassessments as to  what Penaloza's  RFC was in  light of  his\n\nknee condition.  \n\n          The  ALJ  found   Penaloza's  residual   functional\n\ncapacity  to be more restricted.  He determined that Penaloza\n\ncould perform  only sedentary  work.   The difference  in the\n\nphysicians' evaluations and the ALJ's appears to be based  on\n\nPenaloza's   testimony   describing    the   factors    which\n\nprecipitated pain in his legs, evidence not considered by the\n\nconsulting  physicians who reviewed only the medical records.\n\n                             -13-\n\nIn his decision,  the ALJ stated  that \"constant or  frequent\n\nlower extremity movement would  precipitate the pain, as also\n\nwould  . .  . standing  or walking  for prolonged  periods of\n\ntime.\"  Essentially, then, the ALJ's conclusion that Penaloza\n\ncould perform sedentary work  implies his determination  that\n\nsedentary work would not aggravate Penaloza's knee condition.\n\nThe  ALJ  could not  himself  have  assessed  the  effect  of\n\nsedentary work on Penaloza's hypertension  since Penaloza did\n\nnot testify  as to any work-inhibiting  symptoms arising from\n\nhis hypertension.   Presumably, however,  since Penaloza  had\n\nbeen  evaluated by a physician  as having the  RFC to perform\n\nmedium work despite his hypertension,  it can be assumed that\n\nthe  performance  of  sedentary  work  would  not  exacerbate\n\nPenaloza's hypertension.   Cf.  20 C.F.R.    404.1567(c) (\"If\n                              \n\nsomeone can  do medium work, we determine  that he or she can\n\nalso do sedentary and light work.\").\n\n          In  any event, the  physicians' assessments provide\n\nsupport for  the  ALJ's  determination  that  Penaloza  could\n\nperform  sedentary work.   The  regulations  define sedentary\n\nwork as work involving  sitting, with occasional standing and\n\nwalking, and lifting no  more than 10 pounds at  a time, with\n\noccasional lifting or carrying of articles like docket files,\n\nledgers, and small tools.   20 C.F.R.   404.1567(a).   Social\n\nSecurity   Ruling  83-10   defines  \"occasionally\"   to  mean\n\n\"occurring  from very little up to one-third of the time,\" so\n\n                             -14-\n\nthat  periods  of  standing   or  walking  at  the  sedentary\n\nexertional level should comprise no more than about two hours\n\nper  eight-hour  work  day  and sitting  would  comprise  the\n\nremaining  six hours.    The  Ruling  also states  that  most\n\nunskilled sedentary jobs  \"require good use of  the hands and\n\nfingers  for repetitive  hand-finger  actions.\"   SSR  83-10,\n\nreprinted  in  [Rulings   1983-91]  West's  Social   Security\n             \n\nReporting Service, at 29.  The performance  of sedentary work\n\nis  well within  the  strength limitations  indicated in  all\n\nthree  RFC assessments,  accordingly, and  involves primarily\n\nhand  and   finger  skills  which  Penaloza   is  capable  of\n\nperforming without limitation.\n\n          Certain   non-strength    limitations   were   also\n\ndescribed in the  knee RFC assessments.   Penaloza was stated\n\nto  be   able  to  climb,   kneel,  crouch  and   crawl  only\n\noccasionally.    But  even  those limitations  appear  to  be\n\nconsistent with  the performance of sedentary  work, in which\n\nthe ability to sit predominates, with only occasional walking\n\nand  standing.   Furthermore, the  Rulings indicate  that the\n\nability to climb,  kneel, crouch and crawl would  most likely\n\nbe  infrequent,   but  certainly  no  more   than  occasional\n\nactivities  in  sedentary work.    Ruling  83-14 states  that\n\n\"[r]elatively  few  jobs  in  the  national  economy  require\n\nascending or descending ladders and scaffolding\" and that \"to\n\nperform substantially all  of the exertional  requirements of\n\n                             -15-\n\nmost sedentary . . . jobs, a person would not  need to crouch\n\n. . . .\"   See id. at 44.   Similarly, Ruling 85-15 indicates\n                  \n\nthat  crawling is  an  \"extremely rare  factor\" in  sedentary\n\nwork, that  some limitation in climbing  would not ordinarily\n\nhave a \"significant effect  on the broad world of  work,\" and\n\nthat   a  limitation   on  kneeling   \"would  be   of  little\n\nsignificance in the broad world of work.\"  See id. at 93, 97.\n                                                  \n\nAccordingly, we conclude  that there is substantial  evidence\n\nin the record to show that,  as of the date Penaloza was last\n\ninsured,  the   performance  of  sedentary   work  would  not\n\naggravate his hypertension or knee condition.  \n\n          III.  Exclusive Reliance on the Grid\n                                              \n\n          The ALJ stated in his findings that Penaloza had no\n\nnonexertional   limitations,   and   he    therefore   relied\n\nexclusively on Rule 201.25  of the Grid (20 C.F.R.  Part 404,\n\nSubpart P,  Appendix 2)  to determine  that Penaloza was  not\n\ndisabled.   According to Penaloza, the ALJ erred since he had\n\nnonexertional  limitations, consisting  \"mainly of  pain\" and\n\nhis use of  a cane  which would make  it impossible to  carry\n\nwork materials while  walking.  As a result,  Penaloza avers,\n\nthe ALJ could not rely exclusively on the Grid.  \n\n     We  find  no error  in the  ALJ's  reliance on  the Grid\n\ninsofar as pain and  Penaloza's use of a cane  are concerned.\n\nUnder  the regulations,  the  determination whether  pain  is\n\nexertional or nonexertional  depends upon the  precise aspect\n\n                             -16-\n\nof physical functioning that is affected by the pain.  See 20\n                                                          \n\nC.F.R.   404. 1569a(a)-(c).  Pain is an exertional impairment\n\nwhen  it  affects  strength  requirements,  such  as sitting,\n\nstanding and walking.  See id. (a).  It is nonexertional when\n                              \n\nit  affects requirements  such  as  mental,  manipulative  or\n\npostural  work  function.     See  id.  (c)(1).    Penaloza's\n                                      \n\ntestimony  at the  hearings attempted  to establish  that his\n\nknee and back condition and  related pain precluded him  from\n\nsitting, standing or walking.  Consistent with Penaloza's own\n\napproach, the  ALJ determined that  Penaloza's knee condition\n\naffected his ability to stand and  walk (but not to sit), and\n\nthe  ALJ found that Penaloza  could not return  to his former\n\nwork as a security guard which required considerable standing\n\nand walking, but that he could perform sedentary work.  Thus,\n\nthe record fully justified  the ALJ's treatment of Penaloza's\n\npain as an exertional limitation.  Nor was Penaloza's alleged\n\nuse  of a cane  a nonexertional limitation  since it affected\n\nhis  ability to  carry  work materials,  and  carrying is  an\n\nexertional function.  See id. (a).   \n                             \n\n          Although  Penaloza   does   not  point   to   other\n\nnonexertional  limitations,  the   RFC  assessments  by  Drs.\n\nIrizarry  and  Acevedo indicated  that Penaloza's  ability to\n\nclimb,  kneel,  crouch and  crawl  was  limited by  his  knee\n\ncondition.   Climbing, kneeling, crouching  and crawling  are\n\nnonexertional  postural functions, see id. (c)(1)(vi), which,\n                                          \n\n                             -17-\n\nnormally,  would  preclude exclusive  reliance  on  the Grid.\n\nNevertheless, the  ALJ's reliance on the  Grid is supportable\n\nhere.  As Rulings 83-14 and 85-15 make clear, those functions\n\nare rarely required in sedentary work.  Moreover, Penaloza is\n\nnot completely prohibited from climbing,  kneeling, crouching\n\nand  crawling, but  may  in fact  engage in  those activities\n\noccasionally.      Consequently,   Penaloza's   nonexertional\n\nlimitations  would not  significantly erode  his occupational\n\nbase, and the  ALJ was  entitled to rely  exclusively on  the\n\nGrid.  See Ortiz  v. Secretary of Health and  Human Services,\n                                                            \n\n890  F.2d 520  (1st Cir.  1989) (the  Grid may  be relied  on\n\nexclusively  to  yield  a  finding  as  to  disability  if  a\n\nnonexertional  impairment, even  a significant  one, has  the\n\neffect only of reducing the occupational base marginally).  \n\n          Although the ALJ did not expressly determine, as he\n\nshould have,  that  those nonexertional  limitations did  not\n\nsignificantly  erode  Penaloza's   occupational  base,   that\n\ndetermination  may  be  inferred  from his  analysis  of  the\n\nseverity of  Penaloza's knee  condition.  The  ALJ determined\n\nthat,  at  the  time  Penaloza's coverage  expired,  both  of\n\nPenaloza's  knees  showed  good  muscular  strength  with  no\n\nswelling, heat or pain, that when he had pain it responded to\n\nmedication and therapy, that  therapy had increased his range\n\nof motion, and  that his  condition would not  keep him  from\n\npursuing   recreational   activities   or   light   household\n\n                             -18-\n\nmaintenance.   However, the ALJ also  concluded that Penaloza\n\ncould not use his  lower extremities for \"constant repetitive\n\nmovements,\" which clearly would encompass climbing, kneeling,\n\ncrouching and crawling.  In Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health\n                                                             \n\nand  Human  Services,  829  F.2d  192  (1st  Cir.  1987),  we\n                    \n\nconcluded  in a  similar  situation that  an  ALJ could  rely\n\nexclusively on  the Grid.   In Frustaglia,  the nonexertional\n                                         \n\nlimitation at issue was  bending, the ALJ had found  that the\n\nclaimant could  perform the full range of light and sedentary\n\nwork although he  could not engage  in repeated bending,  and\n\nRulings   indicated  that  bending  was  only  an  occasional\n\nrequirement  in light and sedentary work.  We stated that \"by\n\ndefinition [repeated  bending] is a more  strenuous mode than\n\noccasional activity\"  and that  \"[i]t is fairly  obvious that\n\nsuch  a restriction  would  have very  little  effect on  the\n\nability to perform the full range of work at either the light\n\nor sedentary level.\"   Id. at 195.   Similarly, here the  ALJ\n                          \n\nfound  that  Penaloza  could  not engage  in  repetitive  leg\n\nmovements,  which would include climbing, crouching, crawling\n\nand kneeling, and the Rulings make it \"fairly obvious\" that a\n\nlimitation  permitting the  occasional  performance of  those\n\nactivities would have little  effect on Penaloza's ability to\n\nperform substantially  all  requirements of  sedentary  work.\n\nAccordingly, although  it would have been  preferable for the\n\nALJ  to  have   expressly  found  that   Penaloza's  postural\n\n                             -19-\n\nlimitations  did not  significantly  erode  his  occupational\n\nbase, and to have  supported his finding by reference  to the\n\nrecord or Rulings, under the  circumstances his failure to do\n\nso does not require remand.  \n\n          IV.  Remaining Claims \n                               \n\n          Penaloza also appears to  claim that the ALJ failed\n\nto take into account  the combined effects of his  mental and\n\nphysical  conditions.   Penaloza's  first visit  to a  mental\n\nhealth  clinic  was at  his  attorney's  suggestion some  six\n\nmonths after the  coverage period had  expired.  Thus,  there\n\nwas substantial evidence  to support the  ALJ's determination\n\nthat  Penaloza was  not  disabled by  any  nervous or  mental\n\ncondition, and  so there was no  need to consider  how such a\n\ncondition,   when   combined    with   Penaloza's    physical\n\nimpairments,  affected his  capacity for  substantial gainful\n\nemployment.    Moreover,  the  text  of  the  ALJ's  decision\n\nindicates  that   he  considered  the   combined  effects  of\n\nPenaloza's  physical  conditions  and  pain.    He  drew  the\n\nconclusions  he  did about  Penaloza's  physical capabilities\n\nafter   \"considering   the  claimant's   musculoskeletal  and\n\nhypertensive  condition plus  the above  described discomfort\n\nand mild to moderate pain.\"  \n\n          Penaloza  also  alleges  that  the  ALJ cited  only\n\nevidence favorable to the Secretary, disregarded the  medical\n\nevidence  of  his   disability,  and  based   the  disability\n\n                             -20-\n\ndetermination on his  own medical  opinion.   He provides  no\n\ndetail as to what evidence the ALJ allegedly disregarded, and\n\ndoes  not  describe  in  what respect  the  ALJ  ignored  the\n\nopinions  of examining or consulting physicians, or otherwise\n\nbased  his   disability  determination  on  his  own  medical\n\nopinion.   We have reviewed the ALJ's decision and the record\n\nand find  no error  of the kind  Penaloza has  alleged.   The\n\nALJ's determination  that  Penaloza could  perform  sedentary\n\nwork ascribes a functional capacity to Penaloza which is well\n\nwithin the  limitations described in  the uncontradicted  RFC\n\nassessments of record.\n\n          The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -21-\n",

Jesus Penaloza Clemente  (\"Penaloza\")\n                    \n\napplied for  Social  Security disability  benefits,  alleging\n\ndisability  due to  back and  leg injury  and nerves.   In  a\n\nDisability Report,  he further  stated that he  suffered from\n\nhigh blood pressure.   After  a hearing, the  ALJ denied  his\n\nclaim,  but  the Appeals  Council  vacated  the decision  and\n\nremanded for further testimony on pain.  After a supplemental\n\nhearing, the  ALJ again  denied Penaloza's application.   The\n\nALJ found  that Penaloza  had severe hypertension,  which was\n\ncontrolled  with  medication,  and  that  he  had   undergone\n\narthroscopic removal  of torn cartilage in  both knees before\n\nMarch  31,  1988,  the  date  when  his  disability  coverage\n\nexpired,  but that those conditions did not meet or equal any\n\nlisting  in  20  C.F.R.  Part 404,  Subpart  P,  Appendix  1.\n\nAlthough  the  ALJ  determined  that Penaloza  had  \"mild  to\n\nmoderate occasional  pain\" in  both knees, he  concluded that\n\nthe pain was relieved by medication and that the pain did not\n\nreduce  Penaloza's residual  functional  capacity.   Penaloza\n\ncould not return to  his former work as security  guard since\n\nhe could  not stand or walk for more than two hours during an\n\neight-hour work day and  could not use his legs  for constant\n\nrepetitive  movement.    However,  the   ALJ  concluded  that\n\nPenaloza  could  sit and  use  his  arms without  limitation.\n\nFinding that Penaloza had no nonexertional limitations,  that\n\nhe  could perform  sedentary  work, and  that his  vocational\n\nattributes fit the criteria  of Rule 201.25 in Appendix  2 of\n\nthe regulations, the ALJ determined that Rule 201.25 directed\n\na  conclusion  that  Penaloza  was not  disabled.    Penaloza\n\nappealed the ALJ's denial of benefits to the district  court,\n\nwhich  affirmed the ALJ's decision.  He then sought review in\n\nthis court.  We affirm.  \n\n          I.  Allegations of Pain\n                                 \n\n          Penaloza does not challenge the ALJ's determination\n\nthat his  knee condition  and hypertension  did  not meet  or\n\nequal any listing  in the regulations.   He claims,  however,\n\nthat  the ALJ  failed to  consider  his allegations  of pain,\n\nasserting that  he complained \"constantly and persistently to\n\nthe examining  physicians of severe disabling pain.\"   In his\n\ndecision,  the ALJ  noted that  Penaloza did  have knee  pain\n\nduring  the  coverage  period as  a  result  of  a fall  that\n\noccurred  on April 24, 1987.   The ALJ  found that Penaloza's\n\npain responded to treatment, however, and that as of April 6,\n\n1988,  one week  after Penaloza's coverage  expired, Penaloza\n\nwas experiencing no pain  when his knees were palpated.   The\n\nALJ further characterized the pain that Penaloza had suffered\n\nto be of \"moderate character\"  which was relieved by physical\n\ntherapy  and  \"mild analgesics  of  a  non-narcotic character\n\nwhich did not cause  any side effect[s].\"  Apparently  on the\n\nbasis  of Penaloza's testimony at the  hearings, the ALJ also\n\nfound that  Penaloza \"may  experience discomfort and  mild to\n\n                             -3-\n\nmoderate  pain on an occasional basis and it [is] relieved by\n\nthe use of non-narcotic analgesics.\"  Penaloza's      medical\n\nrecords  fully support the ALJ's findings as to the nature of\n\nPenaloza's pain  for the period before  his coverage expired.\n\nThe  records document  that  Penaloza complained  of pain  to\n\nexamining physicians  and to his physical  therapist a number\n\nof  times after his fall.  His complaints occurred even after\n\nthe torn menisci (fibrocartilage)  in both knees were removed\n\narthroscopically.   In  all instances  but one,  however, the\n\nreports state merely that  he reported \"pain\" or \"discomfort\"\n\nor that one or the other of  his knees \"hurt.\"  Only once, in\n\nOctober  1987, within  weeks of  his surgery,  did he  report\n\n\"intense pain,\" and that was to his physical therapist  about\n\nhis right knee.   The pain appears to have  resulted from the\n\nspecific exercise he was  performing during therapy that day.\n\nA  subsequent report in November 1987 stated that he had full\n\nrange  of movement in both knees \"without pain.\"  The records\n\ncontain no further report of pain in his right knee, although\n\nin December 1987 he  reported to his physical  therapist that\n\nthe pain in his left  knee had increased and in January  1988\n\nhe reported to the therapist that his left knee \"continues to\n\nhurt.\"  For the  two-month period between the end  of January\n\nand expiration  of his coverage  on March 31,  1988, however,\n\nthere are no further reports of  pain.  On April 6, 1988, his\n\nphysician reported that he had \"no pain on palpation.\"  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          Most of Penaloza's testimony during the hearings in\n\nOctober  1989  and  June  1990  described  the  pain  he  was\n\nexperiencing  at that time.  Since he had reinjured his knees\n\nin  a fall on March 30, 1989,  before the hearings and a year\n\nafter his coverage  had expired, that testimony  is of little\n\nrelevance  in  determining  his  degree of  pain  during  the\n\ncoverage  period.   (The  ALJ  did  consider that  testimony,\n\nhowever, and determined, as the above summary of his findings\n\nindicates, that  at the  time of  the  hearings Penaloza  was\n\nexperiencing  occasional  mild  to  moderate  pain  which was\n\nrelieved by analgesics.)  \n\n          Some of  Penaloza's testimony did describe his pain\n\nduring the  coverage period  after  his first  fall in  April\n\n1987.   Penaloza explained \"that a toothache would be more or\n\nless the  same\" as the pain he  then experienced.  When asked\n\nto describe the  intensity of the pain, he stated that it was\n\n\"a continuous pain, very strong.\"  He  further testified that\n\nhe told his doctor that he \"could no longer stand the  pain,\"\n\nand  that his  doctor  then recommended  the menisectomy,  or\n\narthroscopic  removal  of  menisci, which  was  performed  in\n\nOctober 1987.  As noted above, although Penaloza continued to\n\nreport  pain  after the  surgery,  he last  reported  pain in\n\nJanuary 1988, and, by  April 1988, he experienced no  pain in\n\neither  knee.  At the hearings,  Penaloza also testified that\n\nhe needed a  cane to walk,  and that he  had received a  cane\n\n                             -5-\n\nfrom  the  State Insurance  Fund.   The medical  records show\n\nthat, several weeks after he fell, he received a prescription\n\nfor a wheelchair from the Fund,  but not that a cane was ever\n\nprescribed or  determined  to  be  medically  necessary  (the\n\nmedical reports  note, however, that he  came to appointments\n\nusing a cane).  \n\n          At the hearings, Penaloza  identified Motrin as one\n\nof  the medications  he was  then taking  and stated  that it\n\nrelieved his pain \"all the time.\"  At  the first hearing, the\n\nALJ also named two other medications -- Indocin and Medrol --\n\nas  being on  a  list that  Penaloza  had submitted  to  him.\n\nMotrin is  a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory analgesic used to\n\nreduce  swelling and  pain.    See  Houts, Baselt  &amp;  Cravey,\n                                  \n\nCourtroom Toxicology (1992) (under  \"Ibuprofen\").  Indocin is\n                    \n\nan  anti-inflammatory  analgesic,   see  The   Sloane-Dorland\n                                                             \n\nAnnotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 373 (1987), and  Medrol is\n                                  \n\nan  anti-inflammatory,  see  Dorland's   Illustrated  Medical\n                                                             \n\nDictionary  993, 1028  (27th  ed. 1988).   Although  Penaloza\n          \n\ntestified that  the pain \"does not  disappear completely,\" he\n\nconfirmed that  the medication  made it possible  for him  to\n\nmove  around.   At  the first  hearing  he suggested  that an\n\nunidentified medicine  which he took at night  to \"relax\" may\n\nhave  caused him  some sleeplessness,  but that  otherwise he\n\nsuffered no side effects from his medications.  At the second\n\nhearing, he testified  that some medications  -- he may  have\n\n                             -6-\n\nbeen  referring  to Medrol  and Indocin  which were  the only\n\nmedications  named besides  Motrin --  caused nausea,  but no\n\ndrowsiness.  At  the hearings, Penaloza did  not identify the\n\nmedications  he took  during his coverage  period, but  in an\n\nundated document entitled \"Claimant's Statement  When Request\n\nfor Hearing  is Filed\", filled  out presumably  in 1989  when\n\nPenaloza  requested  a   hearing,  Penaloza  identified   the\n\nfollowing medications as the prescription drugs he was taking\n\nat  that  time:    Feldene,  Tolectin,   Naprosyn,  Flexeril,\n\nClinoril, and  Minipress.1   With the exception  of Minipress\n\nand  Flexeril,  all  of  those  drugs  are  anti-inflammatory\n\nanalgesics.2     See  id.  (under   \"Piroxicam\",  \"Tolmetin\",\n                         \n\n\"Naproxen\",    and    \"Sulindac\").       Unfortunately,   the\n\nprescriptions given in the medical  records for the period of\n\ncoverage  are  often   illegible,  but   the  following   are\n\nidentifiable:      Motrin,   Feldene,    Naprosyn,   Indocin,\n\nButazolidin, Darvocet,  and Clinoril.  Darvocet  is a \"mildly\n\neffective  narcotic  analgesic\"  used  to  relieve  \"mild  to\n\nmoderate  pain.\"   See  Courtroom  Toxicology,  supra  (under\n                                                     \n\n\"Propoxyphene).      Butazolidin   is  an   anti-inflammatory\n\n                    \n\n1.  Penaloza also identified \"Asolid\",  but it appears not to\nbe  referenced  in  the   Physicians  Desk  Reference  or  in\nPenaloza's medical records.  \n\n2.  Minipress  is   a   hypertension  drug,   see   Courtroom\n                                                             \nToxicology, supra (under the entry \"Prazosin\"),  and Flexeril\n                 \nis  a skeletal  muscle  relaxant used  for  relief of  muscle\nspasms   associated   with   acute,   painful   muscoskeletal\nconditions, see id. (under \"Cyclobenzaprine\").  \n                   \n\n                             -7-\n\nanalgesic.    See Dorland's  Illustrated  Medical Dictionary,\n                                                             \n\nsupra, at 248, 1278.\n     \n\n          Thus, the  medical record and  Penaloza's testimony\n\nprovide  substantial evidence  for the ALJ's  conclusion that\n\nPenaloza's  pain   during  the   coverage  period  had   been\n\n\"moderate\" and that it had been relieved by  physical therapy\n\nand  analgesics by the time his coverage expired.  In support\n\nof his conclusion that Penaloza's  pain had been relieved  by\n\nanalgesics   of   a   \"non-narcotic   character,\"   the   ALJ\n\nspecifically  identified records  from  the  coverage  period\n\nwhich  prescribed Butazolidin, Feldene,  Motrin and Naprosyn.\n\n(He also  referred to  the Claimant's Statement  which listed\n\nthe  medications  taken  in   1989  and  an  exhibit  listing\n\nmedications  taken in  1990, including  Indocin.)   As stated\n\nabove,  Motrin  is a  non-narcotic analgesic,  which provided\n\nPenaloza  the greatest pain relief,  at least as  of the time\n\nthe  hearings were held.   The other analgesic  drugs the ALJ\n\nreferred  to all  appear to  have been non-narcotic  as well.\n\nAlthough  the  ALJ  did  not  mention Darvocet,  which  is  a\n\nnarcotic  analgesic, that  medication  appears  to have  been\n\nprescribed only once when Penaloza began physical therapy.  \n\n          The ALJ also  stated that  the analgesics  Penaloza\n\ntook had no side effects.  His conclusion is supported by the\n\nmedical records, which contain no report of any side effects.\n\nAlthough Penaloza  testified to some side  effects during the\n\n                             -8-\n\nhearings, his testimony was not very probative.  It concerned\n\nmedications  administered during  1989 and  1990 and  did not\n\nidentify which medications  had caused the side  effects.  In\n\naddition,   although  some  of  those  medications  had  been\n\nprescribed  during the  coverage  period,  the  testimony  on\n\nadverse side  effects can fairly  be said to  have implicated\n\nonly  Indocin, which was named  during the second hearing and\n\nwas also prescribed once during the period of coverage.  \n\n          The ALJ's  decision made  no reference to  the back\n\ninjury  which  Penaloza  claimed  disabled  him  during   the\n\ncoverage period.    However,  after  discussing  evidence  of\n\nPenaloza's knee  injuries, pain and high  blood pressure, the\n\nALJ commented that the remaining evidence related only to the\n\ntime  after Penaloza's  coverage  had expired.   Because  the\n\nmedical records for the coverage period contain no reports of\n\nback  pain or evaluation of any back condition, we infer that\n\nthe  ALJ   considered  and  rejected   Penaloza's  claim   of\n\ndisability due to back injury or pain.  In the recitation  of\n\nfacts in  his appellate  brief, Penaloza describes  a medical\n\nrecord  from June  1988, which  refers to  \"disabling painful\n\nresiduals, specially of the  back.\"  But the ALJ  did not err\n\nin not considering  that record.   Not only  does the  record\n\ndescribe  a condition existing  three months after Penaloza's\n\ncoverage expired, but, more  importantly, it appears to refer\n\nto  a different  patient altogether.   The  patient  with the\n\n                             -9-\n\npainful  back had also had his legs amputated, and thus could\n\nnot  have been  Penaloza.   A record  from July  1988 further\n\nindicates that the records of a patient with a back condition\n\nhad  inadvertently been  placed in  Penaloza's file,  and the\n\nJune 1988  report is  likely to have  been that record.   The\n\nmedical records  which do describe Penaloza's  back condition\n\nall pertain  to evaluations  made months after  expiration of\n\nthe coverage period.\n\n          At his  first hearing, Penaloza stated  that he had\n\ncomplained to his physical therapist of  back pain.  Although\n\nhis testimony  suggests  that  his  complaints  had  occurred\n\nduring therapy  in 1987 during  the coverage period,  he also\n\nstated that  the therapy took place at  the \"Medical Center\".\n\nBut  he was  not treated  at the  Medical Center  until 1989,\n\nafter expiration  of the  coverage period.   Furthermore, the\n\nphysical  therapist's  notes  from  1987  reflect  Penaloza's\n\ncomplaints  of knee  pain, but  do not  mention that  he ever\n\ncomplained  of  back  pain.    Therefore,  the  record  amply\n\nsupports the conclusion that  Penaloza did not suffer  from a\n\ndisabling back injury or pain during the coverage period. \n\n          II.  Appropriateness of Sedentary Work\n                                                \n\n          Penaloza argues that  the ALJ's determination  that\n\nhe  could perform sedentary work was wrong because it had not\n\nbeen  shown that  he  could perform  sedentary work  \"without\n\nserious  aggravation to  his  present  physical  impairment.\"\n\n                             -10-\n\nPenaloza does not state whether he  means his hypertension or\n\nhis  knee  condition  by  the  term   \"physical  impairment.\"\n\nHowever, as long  as the finding that  Penaloza could perform\n\nsedentary  work  is   consistent  with  the   evidence  about\n\nPenaloza's residual functional  capacity (\"RFC\"),  presumably\n\nsedentary work would not aggravate either condition.  \n\n          The  record  contains substantial  support  for the\n\nALJ's conclusion that Penaloza could safely perform sedentary\n\nwork  as  of  March  31,  1988.    Three  uncontradicted  RFC\n\nassessments by non-examining  Social Security physicians  are\n\nin  the record,  one evaluating Penaloza's  hypertension, the\n\nother  two his  knee condition.   Penaloza  submitted no  RFC\n\nassessment, although  the ALJ gave him opportunity  to do so.\n\nThe  report   assessing  Penaloza's   RFC  in  view   of  his\n\nhypertension stated:   \"Diagnosis hypertension.  Hospitalized\n\nin Jan  '88 because  of hypertensive  crisis.  Rt  hemiplegia\n\ndescribed  but no  detailed neurologic  exam.   No CT  of the\n\nbrain.   More recent evaluation = no neurologic deficit.  EKG\n\n=  left axis deviation.  Non specific  ST-T changes.  Chest x\n\nRay = cardiomegaly.  Heavy work activity should be precluded.\n\nRFC:   medium  work.\"3     The   assessment  also   evaluated\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  RFC mistakenly  states that  Penaloza's hypertensive\ncrisis occurred in January 1988, which would have been during\nthe coverage  period.   The consulting physician's  confusion\nundoubtedly arose  because  some of  the handwritten  records\nrelating  to  Penaloza's  hospitalization   erroneously  give\nJanuary  5, 1988 as his hospitalization date.  Other records,\nincluding  some  stamped  by   a  dating  device,  which  are\n\n                             -11-\n\nPenaloza's  exertional  capabilities by  checking appropriate\n\nspaces  on the RFC form.  It indicated that, despite strength\n\nlimitations imposed by his hypertension, Penaloza could  lift\n\nand  carry 50 pounds and frequently lift and carry 25 pounds,\n\nand that  he could  stand, walk and  sit about six  hours per\n\neight-hour day and push or pull up  to 50 pounds using either\n\nfoot  or  hand  controls.     According  to  the  assessment,\n\nPenaloza's hypertension did not  affect his ability to climb,\n\nbalance, stoop,  kneel, crouch, crawl or engage in fine motor\n\nactivities.     \n\n          On March  1, 1989,  Dr.  Irizarry Rivera  described\n\nPenaloza's  knee  condition  as  follows:    \"Bilateral  torn\n\nmenisci.   [B]oth knees  repaired arthroscopically  by 10/87.\n\n[T]reated  [with]  physic[al]  therapy,  had  recurrent  knee\n\neffusions  which subsided  by  4/88 &amp;  painless  knees.\"   He\n\nassessed  Penaloza's strength  limitations  by  checking  the\n\nappropriate spaces,  concluding  that Penaloza  retained  the\n\ncapacity to lift  and carry  up to 50  pounds, to  frequently\n\nlift and carry up to 25 pounds, to sit, stand  and walk about\n\n                    \n\ninterspersed  with  the erroneous  handwritten  records, make\nclear  that the  hypertensive crisis  occurred on  January 5,\n1989,  after   the  coverage   period  had  expired.     (The\nhandwritten error appears to reflect the fact that a new year\nhad  just begun and the person writing  down the date had not\nyet become accustomed  to writing \"1989\".)   The \"more recent\nevaluation[s]\", including the results of the EKG and chest X-\nray, which  were referred to  in the  RFC, actually  predated\nPenaloza's hypertensive  crisis and were  within the coverage\nperiod.  \n\n                             -12-\n\nsix hours per eight-hour day, and to push and pull using foot\n\ncontrols up to \"50/25 [pounds].\" (By  implication, Penaloza's\n\nability to push and  pull hand controls was unlimited.)   Dr.\n\nIrizarry  further indicated  that Penaloza could  balance and\n\nstoop frequently, although he  could climb, kneel, crouch and\n\ncrawl  only  occasionally, and  that  his  fine motor  skills\n\n(reaching, handling, fingering, feeling) were unimpaired.  On\n\nJune 14, 1989, Dr.  Acevedo Defillo described Penaloza's knee\n\ncondition  in almost  the same  words as  Dr. Irizarry.   His\n\nassessment  of Penaloza's  physical capacity  was essentially\n\nthe same as Dr. Irizarry's except that he found that Penaloza\n\ncould push and pull both hand and foot controls  \"[t]o 50 lbs\n\nmax.\"  Dr. Acevedo also found that Penaloza could balance and\n\nstoop  frequently, and  climb, kneel,  crouch and  crawl only\n\noccasionally.   He found Penaloza's  fine motor skills  to be\n\nunimpaired.  Thus,  there was basic agreement between the two\n\nassessments as to  what Penaloza's  RFC was in  light of  his\n\nknee condition.  \n\n          The  ALJ  found   Penaloza's  residual   functional\n\ncapacity  to be more restricted.  He determined that Penaloza\n\ncould perform  only sedentary  work.   The difference  in the\n\nphysicians' evaluations and the ALJ's appears to be based  on\n\nPenaloza's   testimony   describing    the   factors    which\n\nprecipitated pain in his legs, evidence not considered by the\n\nconsulting  physicians who reviewed only the medical records.\n\n                             -13-\n\nIn his decision,  the ALJ stated  that \"constant or  frequent\n\nlower extremity movement would  precipitate the pain, as also\n\nwould  . .  . standing  or walking  for prolonged  periods of\n\ntime.\"  Essentially, then, the ALJ's conclusion that Penaloza\n\ncould perform sedentary work  implies his determination  that\n\nsedentary work would not aggravate Penaloza's knee condition.\n\nThe  ALJ  could not  himself  have  assessed  the  effect  of\n\nsedentary work on Penaloza's hypertension  since Penaloza did\n\nnot testify  as to any work-inhibiting  symptoms arising from\n\nhis hypertension.   Presumably, however,  since Penaloza  had\n\nbeen  evaluated by a physician  as having the  RFC to perform\n\nmedium work despite his hypertension,  it can be assumed that\n\nthe  performance  of  sedentary  work  would  not  exacerbate\n\nPenaloza's hypertension.   Cf.  20 C.F.R.    404.1567(c) (\"If\n                              \n\nsomeone can  do medium work, we determine  that he or she can\n\nalso do sedentary and light work.\").\n\n          In  any event, the  physicians' assessments provide\n\nsupport for  the  ALJ's  determination  that  Penaloza  could\n\nperform  sedentary work.   The  regulations  define sedentary\n\nwork as work involving  sitting, with occasional standing and\n\nwalking, and lifting no  more than 10 pounds at  a time, with\n\noccasional lifting or carrying of articles like docket files,\n\nledgers, and small tools.   20 C.F.R.   404.1567(a).   Social\n\nSecurity   Ruling  83-10   defines  \"occasionally\"   to  mean\n\n\"occurring  from very little up to one-third of the time,\" so\n\n                             -14-\n\nthat  periods  of  standing   or  walking  at  the  sedentary\n\nexertional level should comprise no more than about two hours\n\nper  eight-hour  work  day  and sitting  would  comprise  the\n\nremaining  six hours.    The  Ruling  also states  that  most\n\nunskilled sedentary jobs  \"require good use of  the hands and\n\nfingers  for repetitive  hand-finger  actions.\"   SSR  83-10,\n\nreprinted  in  [Rulings   1983-91]  West's  Social   Security\n             \n\nReporting Service, at 29.  The performance  of sedentary work\n\nis  well within  the  strength limitations  indicated in  all\n\nthree  RFC assessments,  accordingly, and  involves primarily\n\nhand  and   finger  skills  which  Penaloza   is  capable  of\n\nperforming without limitation.\n\n          Certain   non-strength    limitations   were   also\n\ndescribed in the  knee RFC assessments.   Penaloza was stated\n\nto  be   able  to  climb,   kneel,  crouch  and   crawl  only\n\noccasionally.    But  even  those limitations  appear  to  be\n\nconsistent with  the performance of sedentary  work, in which\n\nthe ability to sit predominates, with only occasional walking\n\nand  standing.   Furthermore, the  Rulings indicate  that the\n\nability to climb,  kneel, crouch and crawl would  most likely\n\nbe  infrequent,   but  certainly  no  more   than  occasional\n\nactivities  in  sedentary work.    Ruling  83-14 states  that\n\n\"[r]elatively  few  jobs  in  the  national  economy  require\n\nascending or descending ladders and scaffolding\" and that \"to\n\nperform substantially all  of the exertional  requirements of\n\n                             -15-\n\nmost sedentary . . . jobs, a person would not  need to crouch\n\n. . . .\"   See id. at 44.   Similarly, Ruling 85-15 indicates\n                  \n\nthat  crawling is  an  \"extremely rare  factor\" in  sedentary\n\nwork, that  some limitation in climbing  would not ordinarily\n\nhave a \"significant effect  on the broad world of  work,\" and\n\nthat   a  limitation   on  kneeling   \"would  be   of  little\n\nsignificance in the broad world of work.\"  See id. at 93, 97.\n                                                  \n\nAccordingly, we conclude  that there is substantial  evidence\n\nin the record to show that,  as of the date Penaloza was last\n\ninsured,  the   performance  of  sedentary   work  would  not\n\naggravate his hypertension or knee condition.  \n\n          III.  Exclusive Reliance on the Grid\n                                              \n\n          The ALJ stated in his findings that Penaloza had no\n\nnonexertional   limitations,   and   he    therefore   relied\n\nexclusively on Rule 201.25  of the Grid (20 C.F.R.  Part 404,\n\nSubpart P,  Appendix 2)  to determine  that Penaloza was  not\n\ndisabled.   According to Penaloza, the ALJ erred since he had\n\nnonexertional  limitations, consisting  \"mainly of  pain\" and\n\nhis use of  a cane  which would make  it impossible to  carry\n\nwork materials while  walking.  As a result,  Penaloza avers,\n\nthe ALJ could not rely exclusively on the Grid.  \n\n     We  find  no error  in the  ALJ's  reliance on  the Grid\n\ninsofar as pain and  Penaloza's use of a cane  are concerned.\n\nUnder  the regulations,  the  determination whether  pain  is\n\nexertional or nonexertional  depends upon the  precise aspect\n\n                             -16-\n\nof physical functioning that is affected by the pain.  See 20\n                                                          \n\nC.F.R.   404. 1569a(a)-(c).  Pain is an exertional impairment\n\nwhen  it  affects  strength  requirements,  such  as sitting,\n\nstanding and walking.  See id. (a).  It is nonexertional when\n                              \n\nit  affects requirements  such  as  mental,  manipulative  or\n\npostural  work  function.     See  id.  (c)(1).    Penaloza's\n                                      \n\ntestimony  at the  hearings attempted  to establish  that his\n\nknee and back condition and  related pain precluded him  from\n\nsitting, standing or walking.  Consistent with Penaloza's own\n\napproach, the  ALJ determined that  Penaloza's knee condition\n\naffected his ability to stand and  walk (but not to sit), and\n\nthe  ALJ found that Penaloza  could not return  to his former\n\nwork as a security guard which required considerable standing\n\nand walking, but that he could perform sedentary work.  Thus,\n\nthe record fully justified  the ALJ's treatment of Penaloza's\n\npain as an exertional limitation.  Nor was Penaloza's alleged\n\nuse  of a cane  a nonexertional limitation  since it affected\n\nhis  ability to  carry  work materials,  and  carrying is  an\n\nexertional function.  See id. (a).   \n                             \n\n          Although  Penaloza   does   not  point   to   other\n\nnonexertional  limitations,  the   RFC  assessments  by  Drs.\n\nIrizarry  and  Acevedo indicated  that Penaloza's  ability to\n\nclimb,  kneel,  crouch and  crawl  was  limited by  his  knee\n\ncondition.   Climbing, kneeling, crouching  and crawling  are\n\nnonexertional  postural functions, see id. (c)(1)(vi), which,\n                                          \n\n                             -17-\n\nnormally,  would  preclude exclusive  reliance  on  the Grid.\n\nNevertheless, the  ALJ's reliance on the  Grid is supportable\n\nhere.  As Rulings 83-14 and 85-15 make clear, those functions\n\nare rarely required in sedentary work.  Moreover, Penaloza is\n\nnot completely prohibited from climbing,  kneeling, crouching\n\nand  crawling, but  may  in fact  engage in  those activities\n\noccasionally.      Consequently,   Penaloza's   nonexertional\n\nlimitations  would not  significantly erode  his occupational\n\nbase, and the  ALJ was  entitled to rely  exclusively on  the\n\nGrid.  See Ortiz  v. Secretary of Health and  Human Services,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532750\"><a href=\"/opinion/532750/28-socsecrepser-3-unemplinsrep-cch-15109a-victor-m-ortiz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st Cir.  1989) (the  Grid may  be relied  on\n\nexclusively  to  yield  a  finding  as  to  disability  if  a\n\nnonexertional  impairment, even  a significant  one, has  the\n\neffect only of reducing the occupational base marginally).  \n\n          Although the ALJ did not expressly determine, as he\n\nshould have,  that  those nonexertional  limitations did  not\n\nsignificantly  erode  Penaloza's   occupational  base,   that\n\ndetermination  may  be  inferred  from his  analysis  of  the\n\nseverity of  Penaloza's knee  condition.  The  ALJ determined\n\nthat,  at  the  time  Penaloza's coverage  expired,  both  of\n\nPenaloza's  knees  showed  good  muscular  strength  with  no\n\nswelling, heat or pain, that when he had pain it responded to\n\nmedication and therapy, that  therapy had increased his range\n\nof motion, and  that his  condition would not  keep him  from\n\npursuing   recreational   activities   or   light   household\n\n                             -18-\n\nmaintenance.   However, the ALJ also  concluded that Penaloza\n\ncould not use his  lower extremities for \"constant repetitive\n\nmovements,\" which clearly would encompass climbing, kneeling,\n\ncrouching and crawling.  In Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health\n                                                             \n\nand  Human  Services,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st  Cir.  1987),  we\n                    \n\nconcluded  in a  similar  situation that  an  ALJ could  rely\n\nexclusively on  the Grid.   In Frustaglia,  the nonexertional\n                                         \n\nlimitation at issue was  bending, the ALJ had found  that the\n\nclaimant could  perform the full range of light and sedentary\n\nwork although he  could not engage  in repeated bending,  and\n\nRulings   indicated  that  bending  was  only  an  occasional\n\nrequirement  in light and sedentary work.  We stated that \"by\n\ndefinition [repeated  bending] is a more  strenuous mode than\n\noccasional activity\"  and that  \"[i]t is fairly  obvious that\n\nsuch  a restriction  would  have very  little  effect on  the\n\nability to perform the full range of work at either the light\n\nor sedentary level.\"   Id. at 195.   Similarly, here the  ALJ\n                          \n\nfound  that  Penaloza  could  not engage  in  repetitive  leg\n\nmovements,  which would include climbing, crouching, crawling\n\nand kneeling, and the Rulings make it \"fairly obvious\" that a\n\nlimitation  permitting the  occasional  performance of  those\n\nactivities would have little  effect on Penaloza's ability to\n\nperform substantially  all  requirements of  sedentary  work.\n\nAccordingly, although  it would have been  preferable for the\n\nALJ  to  have   expressly  found  that   Penaloza's  postural\n\n                             -19-\n\nlimitations  did not  significantly  erode  his  occupational\n\nbase, and to have  supported his finding by reference  to the\n\nrecord or Rulings, under the  circumstances his failure to do\n\nso does not require remand.  \n\n          IV.  Remaining Claims \n                               \n\n          Penaloza also appears to  claim that the ALJ failed\n\nto take into account  the combined effects of his  mental and\n\nphysical  conditions.   Penaloza's  first visit  to a  mental\n\nhealth  clinic  was at  his  attorney's  suggestion some  six\n\nmonths after the  coverage period had  expired.  Thus,  there\n\nwas substantial evidence  to support the  ALJ's determination\n\nthat  Penaloza was  not  disabled by  any  nervous or  mental\n\ncondition, and  so there was no  need to consider  how such a\n\ncondition,   when   combined    with   Penaloza's    physical\n\nimpairments,  affected his  capacity for  substantial gainful\n\nemployment.    Moreover,  the  text  of  the  ALJ's  decision\n\nindicates  that   he  considered  the   combined  effects  of\n\nPenaloza's  physical  conditions  and  pain.    He  drew  the\n\nconclusions  he  did about  Penaloza's  physical capabilities\n\nafter   \"considering   the  claimant's   musculoskeletal  and\n\nhypertensive  condition plus  the above  described discomfort\n\nand mild to moderate pain.\"  \n\n          Penaloza  also  alleges  that  the  ALJ cited  only\n\nevidence favorable to the Secretary, disregarded the  medical\n\nevidence  of  his   disability,  and  based   the  disability\n\n                             -20-\n\ndetermination on his  own medical  opinion.   He provides  no\n\ndetail as to what evidence the ALJ allegedly disregarded, and\n\ndoes  not  describe  in  what respect  the  ALJ  ignored  the\n\nopinions  of examining or consulting physicians, or otherwise\n\nbased  his   disability  determination  on  his  own  medical\n\nopinion.   We have reviewed the ALJ's decision and the record\n\nand find  no error  of the kind  Penaloza has  alleged.   The\n\nALJ's determination  that  Penaloza could  perform  sedentary\n\nwork ascribes a functional capacity to Penaloza which is well\n\nwithin the  limitations described in  the uncontradicted  RFC\n\nassessments of record.\n\n          The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -21-\n</pre>",
