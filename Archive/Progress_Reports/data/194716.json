Appellant learned in  September 1981 that  the record\n\nwas  lost.   If,  as  appellant  claims,  this bankruptcy  record  was\n\nimportant to his district court case, he could have, and should  have,\n\nfiled his  Rule 60(b) motion at that time,  along with the notice from\n\nthe Federal Archives  and Record Center and appellant's  own copies of\n\nthe  bankruptcy  record  documents   which  he  has  had   all  along.\n\nAppellant's waiting until 1991 to do what he could have done ten years\n\nearlier does not warrant vacating the underlying judgment.\n\n    In any event, we  have reviewed the grounds that appellant  raises\n\nfor  vacating  the 1980  district  court  judgment  and they  have  no\n\nmerit.*\n\n    Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n*Appellant has moved for leave to file a supplemental appendix.
