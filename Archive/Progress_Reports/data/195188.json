Ramon  Torres  Gonzalez  (\"Torres\")  was\n                \n\narrested by  federal agents and  local police at his  home in\n\nPuerto Rico  on  the night  of September  18, 1987.   He  was\n\ncharged with  possessing cocaine with  intent to  distribute.\n\n21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1).    He  was  subsequently tried  and\n\nacquitted by  the jury.   On September 19, 1988,  Torres, his\n\nwife,  and two  children  brought  a  civil  action  charging\n\nvarious  federal  and  local law  enforcement  officers  with\n\nviolating  the plaintiffs'  constitutional rights,  primarily\n\nbased  upon alleged  rough  treatment  meted  out  to  Torres\n\nincident to his arrest.\n\n     The  named  defendants  were  two  agents  of  the  Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration,  a Puerto Rico police sergeant, a\n\nlocal police detective,  and the superintendent of  police in\n\nPuerto Rico  (who was  charged with  inadequately supervising\n\nthe police).   The  constitutional claims  against the  local\n\nofficials  were  based  on 42  U.S.C.      1983,  1985; those\n\nagainst the federal officials were apparently based on Bivens\n                                                             \n\nv.  Six  Unknown  Named  Agents  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of\n                                                             \n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).   Related pendent claims were\n         \n\nasserted under Puerto Rican law.  \n\n     After  a number of motions and deposition discovery, the\n\ndefendants  moved for summary judgment.  The magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that the defendants' motions for summary judgment\n\nbe  granted  and  that  the  pendant  state   claims  not  be\n\n                             -2-\n\nentertained.  The district  court adopted the recommendation,\n\ngranting summary judgment on the merits on the federal claims\n\nand  declining  to  proceed  with  the  state  claims.    The\n\nplaintiffs appeal.  We affirm.\n\n     In their brief on appeal, the only claim that plaintiffs\n\ntry seriously to develop is Torres' own claim that the agents\n\nused  excessive force incident  to the arrest.1   Although he\n\nsays that the agents used vile language, we do not think this\n\nmakes  out  a constitutional  claim, nor  can much  weight be\n\ngiven to Torres'  terse statement that he was  grabbed by the\n\nchest and pushed onto a sofa.  He does not claim to have been\n\nstruck.  The only allegation that arouses some concern is his\n\nclaim that  his hands were  handcuffed behind him  during his\n\ntransportation in such a way  that his hands swelled and were\n\nsore for several days.\n\n     Although Torres' brief on appeal cites only to his right\n\nto \"substantive\" due process, the Supreme Court has said that\n\nabuse  incident  to   arrest  is  tested  under   the  Fourth\n\nAmendment's  more  specific   provisions  governing  seizure.\n\nGraham  v.  Connor, 490  U.S.  386  (1989); cf.  Albright  v.\n                                                         \n\nOliver,  62 U.S.L.W.  4078 (U.S.  Jan.  24, 1994)  (plurality\n      \n\n                    \n\n     1The  amended complaint charged that the arrest was made\nwithout a  warrant but in  due course a warrant  was produced\nand is not challenged on  appeal.  The complaint also alleged\nthat Torres' car and apartment were searched but the brief on\nappeal  makes  no  effort  to show  that  the  searches  were\nunlawful.\n\n                             -3-\n\nopinion).  Whatever the  constitutional source of protection,\n\ntrying to determine when physical force is so excessive as to\n\namount to unconstitutional official action is a recurrent and\n\nvexing  problem that  arises in  various  situations.   E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nHudson   v.  McMillian,  112   S.  Ct.  995   (1992)  (prison\n                      \n\ndiscipline).\n\n     Accepting  all  of   Torres'  allegations  as  true--for\n\npurposes of  summary judgment--we  agree with  the magistrate\n\njudge  and the district  court that tight  handcuffs standing\n\nalone are not enough to  proceed to trial on a constitutional\n\nclaim.  \"[M]inor physical injuries simply are insufficient to\n\nsupport an  inference that  .  . .  officers used  inordinate\n\nforce to effect the intended arrest . . . .\"  Dean v. City of\n                                                             \n\nWorcester, 924 F.2d 364, 369 (1st Cir. 1991).  Torres himself\n         \n\nsaid  in deposition that he had never asked a doctor to treat\n\nthe injury  and never  visited a hospital,  nor is  there any\n\nclaim of permanent damage.  Compare Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n642 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n     The Supreme Court has cautioned against using subjective\n\ntests  or looking to motivation in appraising excessive force\n\nclaims under the Fourth Amendment.   Graham, 490 U.S. at 397-\n                                           \n\n99.  Yet  Torres' claim fares  no better  even if one  thinks\n\nthat why an  action was taken might cast  some indirect light\n\non  the objective reasonableness of  the action.  Here, there\n\nis no evidence that the police deliberately aimed to mistreat\n\n                             -4-\n\nTorres, to retaliate against him, or to do anything unrelated\n\nto ordinary security  measures in aid of an  arrest.  Compare\n                                                             \n\nHansen, 885 F.2d at 645.\n      \n\n     This  conclusion disposes  of the  case as  it has  been\n\nbriefed  on appeal.    Torres' children  claim  to have  been\n\nscared during the arrest but, with nothing more alleged, this\n\nis  hardly actionable conduct.   Torres' wife  was apparently\n\nsearched at another location but nothing in the appeals brief\n\neven hints at the supposed  wrong.  Finally, the brief refers\n\nin passing to testimony given by  one of the agents at  trial\n\nbut  the brief  does not  explain what  was unlawful,  and we\n\ntreat the issue as abandoned.  \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -5-\n",

City of Worcester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555047\"><a href=\"/opinion/555047/gerard-dean-v-city-of-worcester/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 369 (1st Cir. 1991).  Torres himself said in deposition that he had never asked a doctor to treat the injury and never visited a hospital, nor is there any claim of permanent damage.   Compare Hansen v. Black, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529383\"><a href=\"/opinion/529383/kathleen-hansen-v-ronald-l-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has cautioned against using subjective tests or looking to motivation in appraising excessive force claims under the Fourth Amendment.   Graham, 490 U.S. at 397- 99.  Yet Torres' claim fares no better even if one thinks that why an action was taken might cast some indirect light on the objective reasonableness of the action.  Here, there is no evidence that the police deliberately aimed to mistreat Torres, to retaliate against him, or to do anything unrelated to ordinary security measures in aid of an arrest.   Compare Hansen, 885 F.2d at 645.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion disposes of the case as it has been briefed on appeal.  Torres' children claim to have been scared during the arrest but, with nothing more alleged, this is hardly actionable conduct.  Torres' wife was apparently searched at another location but nothing in the appeals brief even hints at the supposed wrong.  Finally, the brief refers in passing to testimony given by one of the agents at trial but the brief does not explain what was unlawful, and we treat the issue as abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The amended complaint charged that the arrest was made without a warrant but in due course a warrant was produced and is not challenged on appeal.  The complaint also alleged that Torres' car and apartment were searched but the brief on appeal makes no effort to show that the searches were unlawful</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
