Tracy, was  convicted  in  the\n\nUnited States  District Court  for the  District of  Maine of\n\nthree  counts of  distribution and attempted  distribution of\n\nlysergic acid diethylamide (\"LSD\")  in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n  841(a)(1) and    846. Tracy also separately pled  guilty to\n\none count of failure  to appear as  ordered by the court,  18\n\nU.S.C.   3146(a)(4).  Tracy was sentenced to 97 months on the\n\ndistribution  counts and a  24-month consecutive  sentence on\n\nthe  failure  to appear  count.   In a  scattershot approach,\n\nTracy  raises  a   plethora  of  arguments   challenging  his\n\nconviction and the resulting sentence.  Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n  3742(b),  the government appeals from  the district court's\n\nrefusal  to  enhance  Tracy's  sentence  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice  under   U.S.S.G.      3C1.1.    We   affirm  Tracy's\n\nconviction,  but vacate and remand  for the district court to\n\nreconsider  whether   an  enhancement  of   his  sentence  is\n\nwarranted under   3C1.1.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Tracy  was initially  indicted in  the District  of\n\nMaine, in an indictment that was unsealed on October 4, 1990,\n\nfor distribution  of LSD in  July 1989  and August 1990.   On\n\nJanuary  15,  1991,  the  district court  empaneled  a  jury.\n\nHowever,  the trial was continued on  January 28, 1991, prior\n\nto the  swearing of  the jury,  when Tracy's attorney  became\n\n                             -3-\n\naware of  a conflict  involving a potential  defense witness.\n\nOne of the government's  witness statements included the name\n\nof  a present  client of  Tracy's attorney.   Because  of the\n\npotential conflict between the two clients, the court granted\n\ndefense counsel's motion to withdraw.  The court also granted\n\nTracy  a continuance of two  weeks to decide  whether to hire\n\nnew private  counsel or  to accept a  court-appointed lawyer.\n\nThe  court reminded Tracy  that his speedy  trial rights were\n\nwaived during  the period  of continuance.    On February  6,\n\n1991, Tracy requested court-appointed counsel.\n\n          A superseding indictment, which changed the date of\n\none  of  the  LSD sales,  was  filed  on  February 26,  1991.\n\nTracy's case was placed  on the trial calendar for  March 25.\n\nHowever, on March  12, Tracy moved for  a continuance because\n\nhe had not yet met with  his new attorney.  The court granted\n\nthe  continuance and later rescheduled  the trial to begin on\n\nMay 20, 1991.\n\n          A  second superseding indictment, which added a new\n\ncount charging Tracy with attempted sale of LSD on August 22,\n\n1990, was returned in five counts on April 24, 1991.  Another\n\njury was empaneled on May  20, but it was not sworn.   On the\n\nday  the trial  was  to  begin,  Tracy's attorney  asked  for\n\nanother  continuance because  Tracy  had broken  his leg  and\n\nwanted a  new attorney.   After determining that  the lawyer-\n\nclient  relationship had disintegrated, the court granted the\n\n                             -4-\n\nattorney's  motion   to  withdraw   and  the  motion   for  a\n\ncontinuance.   The court  again explained to  Tracy that  his\n\nmotion for a continuance stopped the speedy trial clock.\n\n          Tracy's  trial was rescheduled for August 14, 1991.\n\nTracy, however, failed to report by telephone to his pretrial\n\nservices officer on August 12, and failed to appear for trial\n\non August 14.   When Tracy was arrested  in Florida on August\n\n28, he was carrying false identification and  pretended to be\n\nsomeone else.   Authorities returned Tracy to the District of\n\nMaine,  and  the district  court rescheduled  his trial.   On\n\nSeptember  17, the  grand  jury issued  an additional  single\n\ncount indictment  against Tracy charging him  with failure to\n\nappear for trial.\n\n           Trial began in the LSD  case on October 15, 1991.1\n\nAt  the outset, the court instructed the jury to consider the\n\nfive alleged offenses separately.   The government's case was\n\nbased  primarily on  the testimony  of undercover  agents and\n\ninformants,  as well  as several tape  recorded conversations\n\nwith Tracy.   The testimony and  recordings revealed that  on\n\nAugust 18,  1990,  a  cooperating  individual  named  Russell\n\nWright  purchased 20 doses of LSD from Tracy at his cabin for\n\n$80.   On  August 20,  Wright returned  to Tracy's  cabin and\n\npurchased  50 doses  of  LSD from  Tracy for  $150.   The LSD\n\n                    \n\n1.  A judge  different from those who  had previously handled\nTracy's case took over on the day that the trial began.\n\n                             -5-\n\npurchased  on both  August 18  and 20  was on  yellow blotter\n\npaper with black airplanes.\n\n          On August 22, Wright  attempted a third purchase of\n\nLSD from Tracy  at his  cabin.  Several  agents from  Maine's\n\nBureau   of   Intergovernmental  Drug   Enforcement  (\"BIDE\")\n\ntestified that the purpose  of this attempt was to  flush out\n\nthe  source of Tracy's LSD by requesting a high enough number\n\nof doses  that Tracy  would not  have them  on hand.   Wright\n\ntherefore requested  200 doses.   When Tracy replied  that he\n\nhad  only 100, a BIDE agent instructed Wright not to complete\n\nthe purchase.  Wright,  however, testified that he did  get a\n\nlook at  the LSD and noticed  that it was on  the same yellow\n\nblotter paper with black airplanes.\n\n          Another   cooperating  informant,   Curtis  Elwell,\n\ntestified  about Tracy's  alleged offenses  in 1989.   Elwell\n\ntestified  that Tracy supplied him  with LSD, which Elwell in\n\nturn  sold to a  confidential informant  on two  occasions in\n\nJuly  1989.  Elwell admitted  that he was  arrested for these\n\nsales and that his  sentence was reduced from 60 months to 42\n\nmonths  for his cooperation  with the government.   The court\n\ndid not allow  Tracy to impeach Elwell  with a fourteen-year-\n\nold drug conviction.\n\n          The  government  closed  its  case   with  evidence\n\nconcerning Tracy's  flight to Florida.   This was  offered to\n\nshow consciousness  of guilt.   Over Tracy's  objection, Eric\n\n                             -6-\n\nThompson,  a  United  States  Deputy  Marshal  from  Florida,\n\ntestified to Tracy's  attempt to conceal his identity  at the\n\ntime  of his  arrest  in  Florida.    At  the  conclusion  of\n\nThompson's testimony,  the government rested.   Tracy did not\n\nthen move for acquittal.\n\n          Tracy took  the  stand  in  his own  defense.    He\n\ntestified  to  his drug  use,  to the  availability  of drugs\n\nduring  his  youth,  and  to the  availability  of  LSD among\n\nGrateful Dead followers.  Contrary to a tape recording of his\n\nconversation with Wright in which Tracy purportedly said that\n\nhe had  to  \"make  something\"  for  his  LSD  dealing,  Tracy\n\ntestified that he \"was willing to just get [his] money back.\"\n\nTracy further testified that he and his family were afraid of\n\nWright because he seemed aggressive.   According to Tracy and\n\nhis step-daughter, who also  testified, the family decided to\n\nsell Wright  artificial LSD  if he  returned, in an  apparent\n\nbelief  that  Wright  would  then leave  them  alone.   Tracy\n\ntestified  that on August 22, 1990, the LSD that he attempted\n\nto sell to  Wright was  fake and was  on blue blotter  paper.\n\nTracy made no motion for acquittal after resting his case.\n\n          After the  close of  the evidence, the  court again\n\ninstructed  the  jury   to  consider  each  alleged   offense\n\nseparately.  Thereafter,  the jury found Tracy  guilty of the\n\nthree  August 1990 LSD offenses, but acquitted him on the two\n\nJuly 1989 charges.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          Following   the   above  convictions,   but  before\n\nsentencing, Tracy,  on November  7, 1991, entered  a plea  of\n\nguilty to the separate charge of failure to appear.\n\n                             II.\n\n     A.  Pretrial and Trial Issues\n                                  \n\n     1.  Joinder of Counts\n                          \n\n          Tracy contends  that the district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion when it refused to  order separate trials for  the\n\n1989  and  1990 LSD  distribution charges.    Rule 14  of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs motions to\n\nsever, provides  in  relevant part  the  following:   \"If  it\n\nappears that a defendant . .  . is prejudiced by a joinder of\n\noffenses .  . . the court  may order an  election or separate\n\ntrials  of counts,  . .  . or  provide whatever  other relief\n\njustice requires.\"  A district court's denial of a motion for\n\nrelief from  prejudicial joinder brought pursuant  to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 14 is reviewed only for  abuse of discretion.  E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States  v. Chambers,  964 F.2d  1250,  1251 (1st  Cir.\n                          \n\n1992).    Such  a denial  will  not  be  reversed unless  the\n\nchallenger  makes \"a  strong showing  of prejudice.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Gray, 958  F.2d 9,  14  (1st Cir.  1992) (quoting\n                \n\nUnited States  v. Font-Ramirez,  944  F.2d 42,  45 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 954 (1992)).\n                   \n\n          Tracy contends that he  was prejudiced in two ways.\n\nFirst,  Tracy  maintains that  he  was put  in  the untenable\n\n                             -8-\n\nposition of wishing  to testify  on the  1989 offenses  while\n\nwanting  to remain silent on  the 1990 offenses.   See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Bronco, 597  F.2d 1300,  1302-03 (9th  Cir. 1979).\n                 \n\nHowever, as  the magistrate  noted in recommending  denial of\n\nthe motion  to sever below, Tracy's  allegations of prejudice\n\nwere conclusory; they did not show with any particularity the\n\nnature  of  the claimed  prejudice.   To  make  the requisite\n\nstrong showing of prejudice, a defendant must \"present enough\n\ninformation      regarding  the nature  of  the testimony  he\n\nwishes to give on  one count and his reasons  for not wishing\n\nto testify  on the  other     to satisfy  the court  that the\n\nclaim of prejudice is genuine  and to enable it intelligently\n\nto  weigh the  considerations of  'economy and  expedition in\n\njudicial administration' against the defendant's  interest in\n\nhaving a free choice  with respect to testifying.\"   Baker v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 401  F.2d 958, 977  (D.C. Cir. 1968);  Bronco,\n                                                            \n\n597 F.2d  at  1303 (\"[a]n  accused should  show the  specific\n\ntestimony he will present about one offense, and his specific\n\nreasons  for   not  testifying   about  others,  to   justify\n\nseverance.\").    Because  Tracy's claims  of  prejudice  were\n\nconclusory, the district court had  no factual basis on which\n\nto determine whether Tracy's  claim of prejudice was genuine.\n\n                             -9-\n\nTracy's claims of prejudice on appeal remain no more concrete\n\nthan formerly.2  \n\n          Second, Tracy suggests that he was prejudiced  when\n\nevidence of both the 1989 and 1990 distributions was heard by\n\nthe jury.  As a result, Tracy claims, the government was able\n\nto  \"bootstrap\" the credibility of Curtis  Elwell.  The jury,\n\nhowever, acquitted Tracy of  the counts dependent on Elwell's\n\ntestimony.   Thus, Tracy's defense to  the 1989 distributions\n\nwas not prejudiced by any bolstering of Elwell's credibility.\n\n          The district court carefully instructed the jury at\n\nboth the beginning and end of  the case that it must consider\n\neach charge  separately and make a  separate determination on\n\neach  count  without  regard  to  the  others.    See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nChambers,  964 F.2d  at  1251;  Gray, 958  F.2d  at  15.   By\n                                    \n\nrepeatedly  instructing  the  jury  to consider  each  charge\n\nseparately,   the  district  court  \"minimized  any  possible\n\nprejudice\" from the joinder  of offenses.   United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nNatanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112\n                                                        \n\nS.  Ct. 986 (1992).  The jury,  apparently taking heed of the\n\ndistrict court's  clear instructions, acquitted Tracy  of the\n\ncharged 1989 LSD distributions and  convicted him on the 1990\n\n                    \n\n2.  At oral  argument  before  this  court,  Tracy's  counsel\nsuggested for the first time that Tracy was prejudiced by the\nadmission of  prior convictions  to impeach his  credibility.\nAs this argument  was not  presented below  nor mentioned  in\nTracy's  brief, it was waived.   See, e.g.,  United States v.\n                                                          \nZannino,  895 F.2d 1, 17  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 494 U.S.\n                                                   \n1082 (1990).\n\n                             -10-\n\ndistributions.  See Natanel,  938 F.2d at 308;  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

The\n                               \n\njury's selectivity in  its verdicts affords  \"reasonably good\n\nassurance\"  that spillover  prejudice  did  not  result  from\n\njoinder of offenses.  See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 308.\n                                 \n\n          The district court did  not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Tracy's motion to sever. \n\n     2.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\n                                 \n\n          Tracy next contends that the district court  should\n\nhave  dismissed  the indictment  in  January  1991, when  the\n\ngovernment revealed its intent to call a witness who was also\n\na  client  of  Tracy's  then-attorney,  thereby  forcing  his\n\nattorney to  withdraw.  Because  the government did  not call\n\nthe witness  when the case  eventually went  to trial,  Tracy\n\nasserts prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n          As the  government points out,  the record  refutes\n\nthe factual  basis for Tracy's contention.   Tracy's original\n\nattorney withdrew because she learned that another client was\n\na  potential witness for the defense, not for the government.\n\nThe week  before Tracy's  originally scheduled  January trial\n\ndate, the government had disclosed the recorded statements of\n\nits   witnesses,  including  the   grand  jury  testimony  of\n\nDetective  Ron Gastia.   Detective  Gastia had  mentioned the\n\nname of a  confidential informant  who was also  a client  of\n\n                             -11-\n\nTracy's attorney.   Believing  the informant was  a potential\n\nwitness for  Tracy, but that such a role would be against the\n\ninformant's interest,  Tracy's attorney discerned  a conflict\n\nand  withdrew.   Nothing  in  the record  indicates  that the\n\ngovernment  was  aware  of the  relationship  between Tracy's\n\nattorney  and   the  confidential  informant,  or   that  the\n\ngovernment  acted in  any way  but responsibly  in disclosing\n\nDetective  Gastia's  grand  jury  testimony.    The  district\n\ncourt's  denial of Tracy's motion to dismiss was not an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n     3.  Evidentiary Rulings\n                            \n\n     a.  Evidence of Fear\n                         \n\n          Tracy  argues  that  the district  court  erred  in\n\nadmitting evidence of Wright's fear of Tracy.  Tracy contends\n\nthat  this  testimony was  irrelevant and  unduly prejudicial\n\nunder Rule 403  of the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.   Because\n\nTracy did not object  to this testimony at trial,  our review\n\nis  for  plain  error only.    See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nArboleda,  929 F.2d  858, 870  (1st Cir.  1991).   Under this\n        \n\nstandard, we  will  reverse a  conviction  only if  an  error\n\naffects  the  \"fundamental fairness  of  the  trial.\"   E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v. Vest, 842  F.2d 1319, 1326  n.4 (1st Cir.),\n                      \n\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 965 (1988).\n            \n\n          Tracy cannot meet this  high standard.  Wright said\n\nonly  a few  words about  his concerns  for his  safety while\n\n                             -12-\n\ncooperating with the  government.  Such  evidence of fear  in\n\nthe context of drug deals is not unusual as the drug trade is\n\nnot  a safe  business.   In fact,  both Tracy  and his  step-\n\ndaughter testified of their own fear of Wright.  Admission of\n\nWright's concerns  for his  safety plainly did  not undermine\n\nthe \"fundamental fairness of the trial.\"\n\n     b.  Drug Culture\n                     \n\n          Tracy  contends  that the  district court  erred in\n\nrefusing to allow him to testify about the effects LSD had on\n\nhim.   According to Tracy, the testimony would be relevant to\n\nshow that  he was a user, and  not a dealer of  LSD.  We will\n\nreverse  a trial  court's Rule  403  relevance determinations\n\nonly  for an  abuse of  discretion.   E.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nRodriguez  Cortes,  949 F.2d  532,  540-41  (1st Cir.  1991);\n                 \n\nUnited States v. Green, 887 F.2d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                      \n\n          The  district court's Rule  403 ruling  was clearly\n\nnot an  abuse of discretion.  We fail to see how testimony of\n\nthe physical  and psychological effects  of LSD on  Tracy was\n\nrelevant to whether  Tracy was  or was not  a dealer of  LSD.\n\nEven  accepting the dubious  argument that being  a user cuts\n\nagainst being a dealer,  ample evidence of use went  in.  The\n\ncourt let Tracy testify that today's LSD just made him giggly\n\nand did not  produce hallucinations.   He spoke  of his  drug\n\nuse, the availability and widespread use of drugs  during his\n\nyouth, the availability  of LSD among  followers of the  rock\n\n                             -13-\n\ngroup Grateful Dead, and the nonprofit sharing of drugs among\n\nthe  \"rainbow community\" to  which Tracy apparently belonged.\n\nThe jury could have had few illusions.\n\n     c.  Evidence of Flight\n                           \n\n          Tracy  contends that  the district  court  erred in\n\nadmitting, to  show consciousness  of guilt, evidence  of his\n\nflight  to Florida and of his attempt to conceal his identity\n\nwhen  he  was  arrested  there.    According to  Tracy,  this\n\nevidence  was irrelevant and  grossly prejudicial, and should\n\nhave been excluded  under Rules  401 and 403  of the  Federal\n\nRules of Evidence.   Contrary to Tracy's assertions, evidence\n\nof a  defendant's flight and  attempts to conceal  or falsify\n\nidentity  may be presented at trial as probative of a \"guilty\n\nmind\" if \"there is an  adequate factual predicate creating an\n\ninference of guilt of  the crime charged.\"  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nCamilo Montoya, 917  F.2d 680, 683  (1st Cir. 1990)  (quoting\n              \n\nUnited  States v.  Hernandez-Bermudez, 857  F.2d 50,  52 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1988));  United States v.  Grandmont, 680 F.2d  867, 869\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1982).   In  the present  case, before  the deputy\n\nmarshal  from Florida  testified, the  government established\n\nthat  Tracy had been scheduled  for trial in  August 1991 and\n\nhad failed to appear.  Other independent evidence established\n\nhis drug dealings.  There  was a sufficient factual predicate\n\nto  justify  the  admission  of the  flight  and  concealment\n\n                             -14-\n\nevidence  and no abuse of  discretion for the  court to admit\n\nit.\n\n     4.  Pro Se Motions\n                       \n\n          Tracy contends  that the  district  court erred  in\n\nrefusing  to  consider  several  pro se  motions  which  were\n                                       \n\nunsigned  and which were filed in March and April, 1992, when\n\nTracy was represented  by counsel.   A district court  enjoys\n\nwide  latitude  in  managing   its  docket  and  can  require\n\nrepresented parties to present  motions through counsel.  The\n\ndistrict court did  not abuse its  discretion in refusing  to\n\nconsider Tracy's unsigned, pro se motions.3\n                                 \n\n     5.  Waiver\n               \n\n          Tracy raises a host of other conclusory contentions\n\nfor which  Tracy has  provided virtually  no argument  and no\n\ncitation  to  authorities.     Included   among  these   bare\n\nallegations are Tracy's \"arguments\"  that the January and May\n\n1991 jury empanelments subjected him to double jeopardy; that\n\nhis  speedy trial  rights  were violated;  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in refusing to allow him to impeach Curtis Elwell\n\nwith  a fourteen-year-old  conviction; that  his due  process\n\nrights were  violated because Elwell received  a reduction in\n\nsentence for cooperating with  the government; and that there\n\n                    \n\n3.  Tracy also suggests that his convictions must be reversed\nbecause  of the  cumulative  prejudicial  effect of  district\ncourt  errors.  Because we  find that the  district court did\nnot err, we reject this argument.\n\n                             -15-\n\nwas  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the  jury's  guilty\n\nverdicts.  \n\n          It is  well settled  that issues are  deemed waived\n\nwhen \"adverted  to in a perfunctory  manner, unaccompanied by\n\nsome effort  at developed argumentation.\"   See United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n1082  (1990); United States v.

Because Tracy has completely failed  to\n\ndevelop  the  arguments  mentioned  above,  they  are  deemed\n\nwaived.    Nevertheless,  we  have examined  all  of  Tracy's\n\nabandoned arguments and are independently satisfied that they\n\nare without merit.\n\n     B.  Sentencing\n                   \n\n     1.  Amount of LSD\n                      \n\n          Tracy disputes the computation of the amount of LSD\n\ninvolved  in  the attempted  sale on  August  22, 1990.   The\n\ndistrict court assigned a  weight to the LSD offered  but not\n\nsold on August 22 by extrapolating from the weight of the LSD\n\nTracy actually  sold  to  Russell  Wright on  the  two  prior\n\noccasions.   The first sale  on August 18  involved 20 doses,\n\n                             -16-\n\nwhich  weighed a total of  .11 grams (.0055  grams per dose).\n\nThe second sale on August 20 involved 50 doses, which weighed\n\na total of  .32 grams (.0064 grams per unit).   Based on this\n\ninformation, the court determined an average weight of .00595\n\ngrams per dose.  The court  then calculated a weight of  .595\n\ngrams for the 100 doses involved in the third attempted sale.\n\nThis  calculation  produced  a  total weight  for  all  three\n\noffenses of  1.025 grams  (.110 +  .320 +  .595), and a  base\n\noffense level  of 26.  Combined with Tracy's criminal history\n\ncategory III, the calculation yielded a guideline range of 78\n\nto 97 months.\n\n          Tracy contends  that the district court  erred as a\n\nmatter of law by failing to apply the Typical Weight Per Unit\n\nTable  found at  application  note 11  of  the commentary  to\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1.4  That  table indicates  that the  typical\n\nweight per  unit for  LSD is  .05 milligrams (.00005  grams).\n\nApplying this table, the total weight for  all three offenses\n\nwould have  been  .435 grams  (.110  + .320  +  .005).   This\n\n                    \n\n4.  Tracy also contends that the district court's calculation\nviolates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, which\nprovides  a  defendant  with  the right  to  be  sentenced in\naccordance with  accurate evidence.   See Townsend  v. Burke,\n                                                            \n334 U.S. 736, 741  (1948).  As discussed  below, we find  the\ndistrict court's extrapolation from the previous two sales to\nprovide  a  more  accurate  estimate  of the  amount  of  LSD\ninvolved  in the third attempted  sale than would  the use of\nthe Typical  Weight  Per Unit  Table.   We  therefore  reject\nTracy's due process argument.\n\n                             -17-\n\ncomputation would produce an offense level of 20, rather than\n\n26, and a guideline range of 41 to 51 months.5\n\n          Application note  11 of U.S.S.G.    2D1.1 instructs\n\ncourts  to use  its Typical  Weight Per  Unit Table  when the\n\nnumber  of doses, pills or capsules are known, but the weight\n\nof the controlled substance is not known.  The table displays\n\nthe  typical weight  per dose,  pill or  capsule  for certain\n\ncontrolled substances, including  LSD.  Application note  11,\n\nhowever, specifically cautions courts not to use the table if\n\na more reliable estimate of the weight is available:\n\n                    \n\n5.  As an alternative, Tracy suggests that the district court\nshould at  least  have  used the  lightest  known  sample  to\nextrapolate  the weight  of the  LSD in  the third  attempted\nsale.   See United  States v. Martz,  964 F.2d  787, 790 (8th\n                                   \nCir.), (approving  district  court's use  of  lightest  known\nsample), cert. denied, 113  S. Ct. 823 (1992); United  States\n                                                             \nv. Bishop, 894 F.2d 981, 987 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \nCt.  106  (1990) (same).    Applying that  method,  the total\nweight  for all  three  offenses would  have been  .980 grams\n(.110 + .320 + .550).   The base offense level would  then be\n24, and the guideline range would be 63 to 78 months.\n     We  have said in the past that \"'when choosing between a\nnumber of plausible estimates  of drug quantity . . . a court\nmust err on  the side of caution.'\"  United  States v. Sklar,\n                                                            \n920 F.2d 107, 113  (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting United  States v.\n                                                          \nWalton,  908 F.2d 1289, 1301 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \nCt.  532 (1990)).  Here,  Tracy sold more  than twice as many\ndoses of LSD at the higher  weight (.0064 grams) than at  the\nlower weight (.0055 grams).  Thus, the district court did err\non the  side  of  caution because,  had  the  district  court\naccounted  for the greater number of doses sold at the higher\nweight, the average weight per dose would  have equaled .0061\ngrams  ([.11 +  .32] divided by  70).  Given  these facts, we\nthink the district court's averaging  method was conservative\nand   that  it   could  permissibly   conclude  in   all  the\ncircumstances of this case  that this method produced  a more\nreliable  estimate of the amount of LSD involved in the third\nattempted  sale than  would  extrapolating from  the lightest\nknown sample.\n\n                             -18-\n\n          The  Typical  Weight   Per  Unit   Table,\n          prepared from information provided by the\n          Drug Enforcement Administration, displays\n          the  typical  weight per  dose,  pill, or\n          capsule for  certain substances.   Do not\n                                                   \n          use  this  table  if  any  more  reliable\n                                                   \n          estimate of the total weight is available\n                                                   \n          from case-specific information.\n                                        \n\n(emphasis added).  Application note 11 further warns that the\n\ntable  provides a  very conservative  estimate of  weight for\n\ncertain  substances,  including   LSD,  because  the  weights\n\ndisplayed  in  the table  do not  include  the weight  of the\n\nmixture or substance containing the drugs:\n\n           * For controlled substances  marked with\n          an asterisk, the weight per unit shown is\n          the  weight  of  the   actual  controlled\n          substance, and not  generally the  weight\n          of  the  mixture or  substance containing\n          the controlled substance.  Therefore, use\n          of   this   table    provides   a    very\n          conservative   estimate   of  the   total\n          weight.\n\nLSD is marked with an asterisk.\n\n          A district  court's finding of the  amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in an offense will be overturned on appeal only upon\n\na showing of clear  error.  E.g., United States  v. McCarthy,\n                                                            \n\n961 F.2d 972, 978  (1st Cir. 1992); United States  v.

Ct. 2039  (1991).  In the present case, the district court\n\ndid not err in refusing to apply  the Typical Weight Per Unit\n\nTable.  The district  court's finding of the quantity  of LSD\n\ninvolved  in the third attempted sale was based on the weight\n\nof  the actual  doses (on  the same  yellow paper  with black\n\n                             -19-\n\nairplanes), that Tracy  had sold just  days before the  third\n\nattempted  sale.  Where  this \"case-specific information\" was\n\navailable, the court was warranted under note 11 in using the\n\nformer in preference  to the Typical  Weight Per Unit  Table.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.    2D1.1, application note 11;  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nBishop,  894 F.2d 981, 987  (8th Cir.), cert.  denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 106  (1990).   The table produces  conservative estimates\n\nthat,  among other things, do  not account for  the weight of\n\nthe \"mixture or substance\" containing the LSD.  As the weight\n\nof LSD blotter paper  is considered a \"mixture  or substance\"\n\nthat  should be included in calculating the amount of LSD for\n\nsentencing, Chapman v.  United States, 111 S.

Acceptance of Responsibility\n                                     \n\n                             -20-\n\n          Tracy argues that the district  court clearly erred\n\nin refusing to adjust  his base offense level on  the failure\n\nto appear count for  acceptance of responsibility pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1.  According to Tracy,  he has been open and\n\nremorseful with the court since the inception of that charge.\n\nHe notes that he confessed his failure  to appear when he was\n\nfirst brought back  from Florida, and that he eventually pled\n\nguilty to  that charge.  He  quotes a letter that  he sent to\n\nthe district  court, which  stated \"I  have  clearly made  it\n\nknown that  I accept  responsibility for [failing  to appear]\n\nand truly  regret making that decision.   At that time  I was\n\nworried  about the child that I thought my wife was carrying,\n\nand  was a  very confused and  scared man.   But  I regret my\n\nactions and have apologized to this court for them.\"\n\n          A  defendant  is entitled  to a  two-level downward\n\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility if  the defendant\n\n\"clearly   demonstrates   a   recognition   and   affirmative\n\nacceptance  of  personal   responsibility  for  his  criminal\n\nconduct.\"   U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a).   Although a  guilty plea is\n\n\"significant  evidence\" of  acceptance of  responsibility, it\n\ndoes  not, by  itself,  compel a  downward adjustment,  since\n\n\"this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the  defendant\n\nthat is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1, application note 3, United States v. Pavao,\n                                                            \n\n948  F.2d 74,  79  (1st Cir.  1991).   A  sentencing  judge's\n\n                             -21-\n\ndetermination concerning acceptance of responsibility will be\n\noverturned only if clearly erroneous.  E.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nRoyer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n     \n\n          The district court's  determination that Tracy  did\n\nnot genuinely accept responsibility for his failure to appear\n\nis  amply  supported  by  the  record.    Tracy   used  false\n\nidentification  in an  attempt to  conceal his  identity even\n\nafter Florida authorities confronted  him.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Yeo, 936 F.2d 628, 629  (1st Cir. 1991) (use of false name\n      \n\nsupported  denial of  downward  adjustment for  acceptance of\n\nresponsibility).  Further, after observing  Tracy's demeanor,\n\nthe district  court concluded  that he was  opportunistic and\n\nwould  say anything  to minimize his  sentence.   Under these\n\ncircumstances, we cannot say  that the district court clearly\n\nerred in  refusing to adjust  Tracy's base offense  level for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.\n\n     3.  Obstruction of Justice\n                               \n\n          Pursuant to  18 U.S.C.     3742(b), the  government\n\nappeals from the district  court's refusal to enhance Tracy's\n\nsentence for  obstruction of justice under  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1.\n\nThe government  argues that Tracy knowingly  perjured himself\n\nwhen testifying  about the  August 22, 1990  attempted sale,6\n\n                    \n\n6.  The alleged perjury consisted  of Tracy's testimony  that\nthe  third attempted  sale  involved artificial  LSD on  blue\nblotter  paper.   This  testimony  was  directly contrary  to\nWright's  testimony that  he saw  the 100  doses of  LSD that\nTracy attempted to sell on August 22, and these doses were on\n\n                             -22-\n\nand  that,  therefore,  an  enhancement  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice was mandatory.\n\n          U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 provides the following:\n\n          If the defendant willfully  obstructed or\n          impeded,  or  attempted  to  obstruct  or\n          impede,  the  administration  of  justice\n          during the investigation, prosecution, or\n          sentencing   of   the  instant   offense,\n          increase the offense level by 2 levels.\n\nApplication note 3(b)  specifically identifies the commission\n\nof perjury as the  kind of conduct to which  this enhancement\n\napplies.  U.S.S.G   3C1.1, application note 3(b).\n\n          The Supreme Court has recently provided guidance on\n\nthe application  of U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 to  perjured testimony.\n\nSee  United  States  v.  Dunnigan,  61  U.S.L.W.  4180  (U.S.\n                                 \n\nFebruary  23, 1993).   In  Dunnigan, the Supreme  Court ruled\n                                   \n\nthat  once  a  district  court  finds that  a  defendant  has\n\ncommitted  perjury, the  court must  enhance  the defendant's\n\nbase offense level by two  points for obstruction of justice.\n\nId. at 4184; see United States v. Austin, 948  F.2d 783, 788-\n                                        \n\n89 (1st Cir. 1991).  In determining what constitutes perjury,\n\nthe  Court  told sentencing  courts  to  apply the  generally\n\naccepted  definition  of  perjury  in  the  federal  criminal\n\nperjury  statute, 18 U.S.C.   1621.7  61 U.S.L.W. at 4182-83.\n\n                    \n\nthe same yellow blotter paper with black airplanes that Tracy\nhad sold on the two prior occasions.\n\n7.  18 U.S.C.   1621 provides in relevant part the following:\n\n          Whoever    \n\n                             -23-\n\nUnder  that definition,  a witness  testifying under  oath or\n\naffirmation  commits  perjury  if  he  or  she  \"gives  false\n                                                             \n\ntestimony  concerning  a  material  matter  with  the willful\n                                                             \n\nintent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of\n      \n\nconfusion,mistake orfaultymemory.\" Id.at 4183(emphasisadded).\n                                      \n\n          The Court  in Dunnigan  stressed that, in  order to\n                                \n\nimpose  a   3C1.1 enhancement,  a sentencing court \"must make\n\nindependent   findings  necessary  to   establish  a  willful\n\nimpediment  to or obstruction of justice, or an attempt to do\n\nthe  same,  under  the  perjury  definition,\"      i.e.,  the\n\nsentencing  court  \"must make  findings  to  support all  the\n\nelements of a perjury  violation in the specific case.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nThe Court  further preferred that sentencing  courts \"address\n\neach element of the  alleged perjury in a separate  and clear\n\nfinding.\"   Id.    Such express  findings,  according to  the\n               \n\nCourt, help to ensure that sentences will not be enhanced \"as\n\n                    \n\n               (1) having taken  an oath  before a  competent\n          tribunal, officer, or person,  in any case in which\n          a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be\n          administered,  that  he   will  testify,   declare,\n          depose,  or  certify  truly,  or  that  any written\n          testimony, declaration,  deposition, or certificate\n          by  him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary\n          to  such  oath states  or  subscribes  any material\n          matter which he does not believe to be true . . .\n\n          is guilty of perjury . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C.   1621(1).\n\n                             -24-\n\na matter of course  whenever the accused takes the  stand and\n\nis found guilty.\"  Id.8\n                      \n\n          In   refusing   to   apply  the   enhancement   for\n\nobstruction  of justice  in  the present  case, the  district\n\ncourt said,\n\n          [It]  is  a  very  close  call.    It  is\n          apparent  to  the  Court  that  the  jury\n          rejected   the    credibility   of   this\n          defendant and of  his testimony at trial.\n          This Court was  present at that time  and\n          heard that testimony.   This Court,  too,\n          disbelieved    the   accuracy    of   his\n          testimony.\n\n               Nevertheless, there  are many policy\n          considerations that surround the question\n          of enhancing a  base offense level  which\n          increases  potential  punishment  on  the\n          basis  of  the  Court's  conclusion  that\n          perjury  has been  committed.    And  the\n          Court  simply is  not comfortable  in its\n\n                    \n\n8.  The Supreme Court in Dunnigan also emphatically rejected,\n                                 \nas has  virtually every circuit  court, the argument  that an\nenhanced sentence for perjury undermines  a defendant's right\nto testify.  61  U.S.L.W. at 4183; United States  v. Batista-\n                                                             \nPolanco,  927 F.2d 14, 22  (1st Cir. 1991);  United States v.\n                                                          \nMatos, 907 F.2d  274, 276  (2d Cir. 1990);  United States  v.\n                                                         \nWallace,  904  F.2d  603,  604-05  (11th  Cir.  1990).   \"[A]\n       \ndefendant's right  to testify  does not  include  a right  to\ncommit perjury.\"  Dunnigan,  61 U.S.L.W. at 4183.   We reject\n                          \nTracy's argument to the contrary.\n     We also  find no merit  in the  related contention  that\nTracy's denial of  guilt under  oath at trial  cannot be  the\nbasis of  an  enhancement  under U.S.S.G.     3C1.1.    While\napplication note 1 to   3C1.1 does provide that a defendant's\ndenial of guilt  is not a basis for  an enhancement, the note\nexpressly excludes  from this prohibition \"a  denial of guilt\nunder  oath that  constitutes  perjury.\"   U.S.S.G.    3C1.1,\napplication note  1.  As  we have  stated in the  past, \"'the\nauthorized  procedure for asserting  innocence in  a criminal\nproceeding  is the tender of an  unsworn 'not guilty' plea.'\"\nUnited  States v.  Brum, 948  F.2d 817,  820 (1st  Cir. 1991)\n                       \n(quoting Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 22).\n                        \n\n                             -25-\n\n          own mind in  concluding that the  conduct\n          amounts   to    perjury   of   sufficient\n          significance    to   justify    such   an\n          enhancement.\n\n          The government contends that as the district court,\n\nin  the  above-quoted  passage,  found that  Tracy  committed\n\nperjury, the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice\n\nwas  mandated.  Quoting the very same passage, Tracy contends\n\nthat  the  district court  did  not  find perjury,  and  more\n\nparticularly that the district court did not make a  specific\n\nfinding that Tracy had willfully lied.  \n\n          We agree with Tracy  that it is not clear  from the\n\ndistrict court's discussion of obstruction of justice whether\n\nthe  court  found  that  all  the  elements of  perjury  were\n\nsatisfied.  While the district court expressly stated that it\n\n\"disbelieved the  accuracy of  [Tracy's]  testimony,\" we  are\n\nunable to  determine whether  the court also  found that  the\n\ntestimony  concerned   a  material  matter,  or   that  Tracy\n\nintentionally  provided the  false  testimony.9   It is  also\n\n                    \n\n9.  The  government  suggests  that  we can  imply  from  the\ndistrict court's discussion in  connection with its ruling on\nthe issue of acceptance  of responsibility, that the district\ncourt believed that Tracy had knowingly not told the truth in\nhis  trial testimony.  We decline the invitation.  To \"imply\"\na finding of willful intent to commit perjury on the basis of\na district  court's general  comments not made  in connection\nwith the  court's perjury  discussion would stretch  too far,\nespecially  in a case where the court itself declined to find\nobstruction.  We  note also the Supreme  Court's direction in\nDunnigan that district courts \"must make independent findings\n        \nto  establish  a  willful  impediment to  or  obstruction  of\njustice,  or an  attempt to  do the  same, under  the perjury\ndefinition.\"  61 U.S.L.W. at 4183.\n\n                             -26-\n\npossible  to  interpret the  district  court's  statements as\n\nfinding perjury,  but  requiring something  more  than  basic\n\nperjury to justify an enhancement for obstruction of justice.\n\n          We   think  the   proper   resolution,   in   these\n\ncircumstances, is  to vacate the  sentence and remand  to the\n\ndistrict court \"to make findings to support all  the elements\n\nof  a  perjury  violation,\"  or  to  articulate  clearly  the\n\nelements it believes have not been satisfied.   See Dunnigan,\n                                                            \n\n61  U.S.L.W. at  4183.   In  making  this determination,  the\n\ndistrict court, inter alia,  should be guided by  the Supreme\n                          \n\nCourt's opinion  in Dunnigan,  the definition of  perjury set\n                            \n\nforth in  the federal criminal  perjury statute, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n1621, and  case law interpreting that  definition, see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v.

Tracy, was  convicted  in  the\n\nUnited States  District Court  for the  District of  Maine of\n\nthree  counts of  distribution and attempted  distribution of\n\nlysergic acid diethylamide (\"LSD\")  in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n  841(a)(1) and    846. Tracy also separately pled  guilty to\n\none count of failure  to appear as  ordered by the court,  18\n\nU.S.C.   3146(a)(4).  Tracy was sentenced to 97 months on the\n\ndistribution  counts and a  24-month consecutive  sentence on\n\nthe  failure  to appear  count.   In a  scattershot approach,\n\nTracy  raises  a   plethora  of  arguments   challenging  his\n\nconviction and the resulting sentence.  Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n  3742(b),  the government appeals from  the district court's\n\nrefusal  to  enhance  Tracy's  sentence  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice  under   U.S.S.G.      3C1.1.    We   affirm  Tracy's\n\nconviction,  but vacate and remand  for the district court to\n\nreconsider  whether   an  enhancement  of   his  sentence  is\n\nwarranted under   3C1.1.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Tracy  was initially  indicted in  the District  of\n\nMaine, in an indictment that was unsealed on October 4, 1990,\n\nfor distribution  of LSD in  July 1989  and August 1990.   On\n\nJanuary  15,  1991,  the  district court  empaneled  a  jury.\n\nHowever,  the trial was continued on  January 28, 1991, prior\n\nto the  swearing of  the jury,  when Tracy's attorney  became\n\n                             -3-\n\naware of  a conflict  involving a potential  defense witness.\n\nOne of the government's  witness statements included the name\n\nof  a present  client of  Tracy's attorney.   Because  of the\n\npotential conflict between the two clients, the court granted\n\ndefense counsel's motion to withdraw.  The court also granted\n\nTracy  a continuance of two  weeks to decide  whether to hire\n\nnew private  counsel or  to accept a  court-appointed lawyer.\n\nThe  court reminded Tracy  that his speedy  trial rights were\n\nwaived during  the period  of continuance.    On February  6,\n\n1991, Tracy requested court-appointed counsel.\n\n          A superseding indictment, which changed the date of\n\none  of  the  LSD sales,  was  filed  on  February 26,  1991.\n\nTracy's case was placed  on the trial calendar for  March 25.\n\nHowever, on March  12, Tracy moved for  a continuance because\n\nhe had not yet met with  his new attorney.  The court granted\n\nthe  continuance and later rescheduled  the trial to begin on\n\nMay 20, 1991.\n\n          A  second superseding indictment, which added a new\n\ncount charging Tracy with attempted sale of LSD on August 22,\n\n1990, was returned in five counts on April 24, 1991.  Another\n\njury was empaneled on May  20, but it was not sworn.   On the\n\nday  the trial  was  to  begin,  Tracy's attorney  asked  for\n\nanother  continuance because  Tracy  had broken  his leg  and\n\nwanted a  new attorney.   After determining that  the lawyer-\n\nclient  relationship had disintegrated, the court granted the\n\n                             -4-\n\nattorney's  motion   to  withdraw   and  the  motion   for  a\n\ncontinuance.   The court  again explained to  Tracy that  his\n\nmotion for a continuance stopped the speedy trial clock.\n\n          Tracy's  trial was rescheduled for August 14, 1991.\n\nTracy, however, failed to report by telephone to his pretrial\n\nservices officer on August 12, and failed to appear for trial\n\non August 14.   When Tracy was arrested  in Florida on August\n\n28, he was carrying false identification and  pretended to be\n\nsomeone else.   Authorities returned Tracy to the District of\n\nMaine,  and  the district  court rescheduled  his trial.   On\n\nSeptember  17, the  grand  jury issued  an additional  single\n\ncount indictment  against Tracy charging him  with failure to\n\nappear for trial.\n\n           Trial began in the LSD  case on October 15, 1991.1\n\nAt  the outset, the court instructed the jury to consider the\n\nfive alleged offenses separately.   The government's case was\n\nbased  primarily on  the testimony  of undercover  agents and\n\ninformants,  as well  as several tape  recorded conversations\n\nwith Tracy.   The testimony and  recordings revealed that  on\n\nAugust 18,  1990,  a  cooperating  individual  named  Russell\n\nWright  purchased 20 doses of LSD from Tracy at his cabin for\n\n$80.   On  August 20,  Wright returned  to Tracy's  cabin and\n\npurchased  50 doses  of  LSD from  Tracy for  $150.   The LSD\n\n                    \n\n1.  A judge  different from those who  had previously handled\nTracy's case took over on the day that the trial began.\n\n                             -5-\n\npurchased  on both  August 18  and 20  was on  yellow blotter\n\npaper with black airplanes.\n\n          On August 22, Wright  attempted a third purchase of\n\nLSD from Tracy  at his  cabin.  Several  agents from  Maine's\n\nBureau   of   Intergovernmental  Drug   Enforcement  (\"BIDE\")\n\ntestified that the purpose  of this attempt was to  flush out\n\nthe  source of Tracy's LSD by requesting a high enough number\n\nof doses  that Tracy  would not  have them  on hand.   Wright\n\ntherefore requested  200 doses.   When Tracy replied  that he\n\nhad  only 100, a BIDE agent instructed Wright not to complete\n\nthe purchase.  Wright,  however, testified that he did  get a\n\nlook at  the LSD and noticed  that it was on  the same yellow\n\nblotter paper with black airplanes.\n\n          Another   cooperating  informant,   Curtis  Elwell,\n\ntestified  about Tracy's  alleged offenses  in 1989.   Elwell\n\ntestified  that Tracy supplied him  with LSD, which Elwell in\n\nturn  sold to a  confidential informant  on two  occasions in\n\nJuly  1989.  Elwell admitted  that he was  arrested for these\n\nsales and that his  sentence was reduced from 60 months to 42\n\nmonths  for his cooperation  with the government.   The court\n\ndid not allow  Tracy to impeach Elwell  with a fourteen-year-\n\nold drug conviction.\n\n          The  government  closed  its  case   with  evidence\n\nconcerning Tracy's  flight to Florida.   This was  offered to\n\nshow consciousness  of guilt.   Over Tracy's  objection, Eric\n\n                             -6-\n\nThompson,  a  United  States  Deputy  Marshal  from  Florida,\n\ntestified to Tracy's  attempt to conceal his identity  at the\n\ntime  of his  arrest  in  Florida.    At  the  conclusion  of\n\nThompson's testimony,  the government rested.   Tracy did not\n\nthen move for acquittal.\n\n          Tracy took  the  stand  in  his own  defense.    He\n\ntestified  to  his drug  use,  to the  availability  of drugs\n\nduring  his  youth,  and  to the  availability  of  LSD among\n\nGrateful Dead followers.  Contrary to a tape recording of his\n\nconversation with Wright in which Tracy purportedly said that\n\nhe had  to  \"make  something\"  for  his  LSD  dealing,  Tracy\n\ntestified that he \"was willing to just get [his] money back.\"\n\nTracy further testified that he and his family were afraid of\n\nWright because he seemed aggressive.   According to Tracy and\n\nhis step-daughter, who also  testified, the family decided to\n\nsell Wright  artificial LSD  if he  returned, in an  apparent\n\nbelief  that  Wright  would  then leave  them  alone.   Tracy\n\ntestified  that on August 22, 1990, the LSD that he attempted\n\nto sell to  Wright was  fake and was  on blue blotter  paper.\n\nTracy made no motion for acquittal after resting his case.\n\n          After the  close of  the evidence, the  court again\n\ninstructed  the  jury   to  consider  each  alleged   offense\n\nseparately.  Thereafter,  the jury found Tracy  guilty of the\n\nthree  August 1990 LSD offenses, but acquitted him on the two\n\nJuly 1989 charges.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          Following   the   above  convictions,   but  before\n\nsentencing, Tracy,  on November  7, 1991, entered  a plea  of\n\nguilty to the separate charge of failure to appear.\n\n                             II.\n\n     A.  Pretrial and Trial Issues\n                                  \n\n     1.  Joinder of Counts\n                          \n\n          Tracy contends  that the district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion when it refused to  order separate trials for  the\n\n1989  and  1990 LSD  distribution charges.    Rule 14  of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs motions to\n\nsever, provides  in  relevant part  the  following:   \"If  it\n\nappears that a defendant . .  . is prejudiced by a joinder of\n\noffenses .  . . the court  may order an  election or separate\n\ntrials  of counts,  . .  . or  provide whatever  other relief\n\njustice requires.\"  A district court's denial of a motion for\n\nrelief from  prejudicial joinder brought pursuant  to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 14 is reviewed only for  abuse of discretion.  E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States  v.

To  make  the requisite\n\nstrong showing of prejudice, a defendant must \"present enough\n\ninformation      regarding  the nature  of  the testimony  he\n\nwishes to give on  one count and his reasons  for not wishing\n\nto testify  on the  other     to satisfy  the court  that the\n\nclaim of prejudice is genuine  and to enable it intelligently\n\nto  weigh the  considerations of  'economy and  expedition in\n\njudicial administration' against the defendant's  interest in\n\nhaving a free choice  with respect to testifying.\"   Baker v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"281912\"><a href=\"/opinion/281912/robert-g-baker-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977  (D.C.

Because  Tracy's claims  of  prejudice  were\n\nconclusory, the district court had  no factual basis on which\n\nto determine whether Tracy's  claim of prejudice was genuine.\n\n                             -9-\n\nTracy's claims of prejudice on appeal remain no more concrete\n\nthan formerly.2  \n\n          Second, Tracy suggests that he was prejudiced  when\n\nevidence of both the 1989 and 1990 distributions was heard by\n\nthe jury.  As a result, Tracy claims, the government was able\n\nto  \"bootstrap\" the credibility of Curtis  Elwell.  The jury,\n\nhowever, acquitted Tracy of  the counts dependent on Elwell's\n\ntestimony.   Thus, Tracy's defense to  the 1989 distributions\n\nwas not prejudiced by any bolstering of Elwell's credibility.\n\n          The district court carefully instructed the jury at\n\nboth the beginning and end of  the case that it must consider\n\neach charge  separately and make a  separate determination on\n\neach  count  without  regard  to  the  others.

The\n                               \n\njury's selectivity in  its verdicts affords  \"reasonably good\n\nassurance\"  that spillover  prejudice  did  not  result  from\n\njoinder of offenses.  See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 308.\n                                 \n\n          The district court did  not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Tracy's motion to sever. \n\n     2.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\n                                 \n\n          Tracy next contends that the district court  should\n\nhave  dismissed  the indictment  in  January  1991, when  the\n\ngovernment revealed its intent to call a witness who was also\n\na  client  of  Tracy's  then-attorney,  thereby  forcing  his\n\nattorney to  withdraw.  Because  the government did  not call\n\nthe witness  when the case  eventually went  to trial,  Tracy\n\nasserts prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n          As the  government points out,  the record  refutes\n\nthe factual  basis for Tracy's contention.   Tracy's original\n\nattorney withdrew because she learned that another client was\n\na  potential witness for the defense, not for the government.\n\nThe week  before Tracy's  originally scheduled  January trial\n\ndate, the government had disclosed the recorded statements of\n\nits   witnesses,  including  the   grand  jury  testimony  of\n\nDetective  Ron Gastia.   Detective  Gastia had  mentioned the\n\nname of a  confidential informant  who was also  a client  of\n\n                             -11-\n\nTracy's attorney.   Believing  the informant was  a potential\n\nwitness for  Tracy, but that such a role would be against the\n\ninformant's interest,  Tracy's attorney discerned  a conflict\n\nand  withdrew.   Nothing  in  the record  indicates  that the\n\ngovernment  was  aware  of the  relationship  between Tracy's\n\nattorney  and   the  confidential  informant,  or   that  the\n\ngovernment  acted in  any way  but responsibly  in disclosing\n\nDetective  Gastia's  grand  jury  testimony.    The  district\n\ncourt's  denial of Tracy's motion to dismiss was not an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n     3.  Evidentiary Rulings\n                            \n\n     a.  Evidence of Fear\n                         \n\n          Tracy  argues  that  the district  court  erred  in\n\nadmitting evidence of Wright's fear of Tracy.  Tracy contends\n\nthat  this  testimony was  irrelevant and  unduly prejudicial\n\nunder Rule 403  of the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.   Because\n\nTracy did not object  to this testimony at trial,  our review\n\nis  for  plain  error only.    See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nArboleda,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558577\"><a href=\"/opinion/558577/united-states-v-carlos-arboleda-united-states-v-martin-castillo-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870  (1st Cir.  1991).   Under this\n        \n\nstandard, we  will  reverse a  conviction  only if  an  error\n\naffects  the  \"fundamental fairness  of  the  trial.\"   E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.

Wright said\n\nonly  a few  words about  his concerns  for his  safety while\n\n                             -12-\n\ncooperating with the  government.  Such  evidence of fear  in\n\nthe context of drug deals is not unusual as the drug trade is\n\nnot  a safe  business.   In fact,  both Tracy  and his  step-\n\ndaughter testified of their own fear of Wright.  Admission of\n\nWright's concerns  for his  safety plainly did  not undermine\n\nthe \"fundamental fairness of the trial.\"\n\n     b.  Drug Culture\n                     \n\n          Tracy  contends  that the  district court  erred in\n\nrefusing to allow him to testify about the effects LSD had on\n\nhim.   According to Tracy, the testimony would be relevant to\n\nshow that  he was a user, and  not a dealer of  LSD.  We will\n\nreverse  a trial  court's Rule  403  relevance determinations\n\nonly  for an  abuse of  discretion.   E.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nRodriguez  Cortes,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572412\"><a href=\"/opinion/572412/united-states-v-fabio-rodriguez-cortes-united-states-v-eduardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  540-41  (1st Cir.  1991);\n                 \n\nUnited States v.

We fail to see how testimony of\n\nthe physical  and psychological effects  of LSD on  Tracy was\n\nrelevant to whether  Tracy was  or was not  a dealer of  LSD.\n\nEven  accepting the dubious  argument that being  a user cuts\n\nagainst being a dealer,  ample evidence of use went  in.  The\n\ncourt let Tracy testify that today's LSD just made him giggly\n\nand did not  produce hallucinations.   He spoke  of his  drug\n\nuse, the availability and widespread use of drugs  during his\n\nyouth, the availability  of LSD among  followers of the  rock\n\n                             -13-\n\ngroup Grateful Dead, and the nonprofit sharing of drugs among\n\nthe  \"rainbow community\" to  which Tracy apparently belonged.\n\nThe jury could have had few illusions.\n\n     c.  Evidence of Flight\n                           \n\n          Tracy  contends that  the district  court  erred in\n\nadmitting, to  show consciousness  of guilt, evidence  of his\n\nflight  to Florida and of his attempt to conceal his identity\n\nwhen  he  was  arrested  there.    According to  Tracy,  this\n\nevidence  was irrelevant and  grossly prejudicial, and should\n\nhave been excluded  under Rules  401 and 403  of the  Federal\n\nRules of Evidence.   Contrary to Tracy's assertions, evidence\n\nof a  defendant's flight and  attempts to conceal  or falsify\n\nidentity  may be presented at trial as probative of a \"guilty\n\nmind\" if \"there is an  adequate factual predicate creating an\n\ninference of guilt of  the crime charged.\"  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nCamilo Montoya, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550647\"><a href=\"/opinion/550647/united-states-v-juan-camilo-montoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683  (1st Cir. 1990)  (quoting\n              \n\nUnited  States v.

In  the present  case, before  the deputy\n\nmarshal  from Florida  testified, the  government established\n\nthat  Tracy had been scheduled  for trial in  August 1991 and\n\nhad failed to appear.

Pro Se Motions\n                       \n\n          Tracy contends  that the  district  court erred  in\n\nrefusing  to  consider  several  pro se  motions  which  were\n                                       \n\nunsigned  and which were filed in March and April, 1992, when\n\nTracy was represented  by counsel.   A district court  enjoys\n\nwide  latitude  in  managing   its  docket  and  can  require\n\nrepresented parties to present  motions through counsel.  The\n\ndistrict court did  not abuse its  discretion in refusing  to\n\nconsider Tracy's unsigned, pro se motions.3\n                                 \n\n     5.  Waiver\n               \n\n          Tracy raises a host of other conclusory contentions\n\nfor which  Tracy has  provided virtually  no argument  and no\n\ncitation  to  authorities.     Included   among  these   bare\n\nallegations are Tracy's \"arguments\"  that the January and May\n\n1991 jury empanelments subjected him to double jeopardy; that\n\nhis  speedy trial  rights  were violated;  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in refusing to allow him to impeach Curtis Elwell\n\nwith  a fourteen-year-old  conviction; that  his due  process\n\nrights were  violated because Elwell received  a reduction in\n\nsentence for cooperating with  the government; and that there\n\n                    \n\n3.  Tracy also suggests that his convictions must be reversed\nbecause  of the  cumulative  prejudicial  effect of  district\ncourt  errors.  Because we  find that the  district court did\nnot err, we reject this argument.\n\n                             -15-\n\nwas  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the  jury's  guilty\n\nverdicts.  \n\n          It is  well settled  that issues are  deemed waived\n\nwhen \"adverted  to in a perfunctory  manner, unaccompanied by\n\nsome effort  at developed argumentation.\"   See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Because Tracy has completely failed  to\n\ndevelop  the  arguments  mentioned  above,  they  are  deemed\n\nwaived.    Nevertheless,  we  have examined  all  of  Tracy's\n\nabandoned arguments and are independently satisfied that they\n\nare without merit.\n\n     B.  Sentencing\n                   \n\n     1.  Amount of LSD\n                      \n\n          Tracy disputes the computation of the amount of LSD\n\ninvolved  in  the attempted  sale on  August  22, 1990.   The\n\ndistrict court assigned a  weight to the LSD offered  but not\n\nsold on August 22 by extrapolating from the weight of the LSD\n\nTracy actually  sold  to  Russell  Wright on  the  two  prior\n\noccasions.   The first sale  on August 18  involved 20 doses,\n\n                             -16-\n\nwhich  weighed a total of  .11 grams (.0055  grams per dose).\n\nThe second sale on August 20 involved 50 doses, which weighed\n\na total of  .32 grams (.0064 grams per unit).   Based on this\n\ninformation, the court determined an average weight of .00595\n\ngrams per dose.  The court  then calculated a weight of  .595\n\ngrams for the 100 doses involved in the third attempted sale.\n\nThis  calculation  produced  a  total weight  for  all  three\n\noffenses of  1.025 grams  (.110 +  .320 +  .595), and a  base\n\noffense level  of 26.  Combined with Tracy's criminal history\n\ncategory III, the calculation yielded a guideline range of 78\n\nto 97 months.\n\n          Tracy contends  that the district court  erred as a\n\nmatter of law by failing to apply the Typical Weight Per Unit\n\nTable  found at  application  note 11  of  the commentary  to\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1.4  That  table indicates  that the  typical\n\nweight per  unit for  LSD is  .05 milligrams (.00005  grams).\n\nApplying this table, the total weight for  all three offenses\n\nwould have  been  .435 grams  (.110  + .320  +  .005).   This\n\n                    \n\n4.  Tracy also contends that the district court's calculation\nviolates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, which\nprovides  a  defendant  with  the right  to  be  sentenced in\naccordance with  accurate evidence.   See Townsend  v. Burke,\n                                                            \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104579\"><a href=\"/opinion/104579/townsend-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741  (1948).  As discussed  below, we find  the\ndistrict court's extrapolation from the previous two sales to\nprovide  a  more  accurate  estimate  of the  amount  of  LSD\ninvolved  in the third attempted  sale than would  the use of\nthe Typical  Weight  Per Unit  Table.   We  therefore  reject\nTracy's due process argument.\n\n                             -17-\n\ncomputation would produce an offense level of 20, rather than\n\n26, and a guideline range of 41 to 51 months.5\n\n          Application note  11 of U.S.S.G.    2D1.1 instructs\n\ncourts  to use  its Typical  Weight Per  Unit Table  when the\n\nnumber  of doses, pills or capsules are known, but the weight\n\nof the controlled substance is not known.  The table displays\n\nthe  typical weight  per dose,  pill or  capsule  for certain\n\ncontrolled substances, including  LSD.  Application note  11,\n\nhowever, specifically cautions courts not to use the table if\n\na more reliable estimate of the weight is available:\n\n                    \n\n5.  As an alternative, Tracy suggests that the district court\nshould at  least  have  used the  lightest  known  sample  to\nextrapolate  the weight  of the  LSD in  the third  attempted\nsale.

Here,  Tracy sold more  than twice as many\ndoses of LSD at the higher  weight (.0064 grams) than at  the\nlower weight (.0055 grams).  Thus, the district court did err\non the  side  of  caution because,  had  the  district  court\naccounted  for the greater number of doses sold at the higher\nweight, the average weight per dose would  have equaled .0061\ngrams  ([.11 +  .32] divided by  70).  Given  these facts, we\nthink the district court's averaging  method was conservative\nand   that  it   could  permissibly   conclude  in   all  the\ncircumstances of this case  that this method produced  a more\nreliable  estimate of the amount of LSD involved in the third\nattempted  sale than  would  extrapolating from  the lightest\nknown sample.\n\n                             -18-\n\n          The  Typical  Weight   Per  Unit   Table,\n          prepared from information provided by the\n          Drug Enforcement Administration, displays\n          the  typical  weight per  dose,  pill, or\n          capsule for  certain substances.

Application note 11 further warns that the\n\ntable  provides a  very conservative  estimate of  weight for\n\ncertain  substances,  including   LSD,  because  the  weights\n\ndisplayed  in  the table  do not  include  the weight  of the\n\nmixture or substance containing the drugs:\n\n           * For controlled substances  marked with\n          an asterisk, the weight per unit shown is\n          the  weight  of  the   actual  controlled\n          substance, and not  generally the  weight\n          of  the  mixture or  substance containing\n          the controlled substance.

According to Tracy,  he has been open and\n\nremorseful with the court since the inception of that charge.\n\nHe notes that he confessed his failure  to appear when he was\n\nfirst brought back  from Florida, and that he eventually pled\n\nguilty to  that charge.  He  quotes a letter that  he sent to\n\nthe district  court, which  stated \"I  have  clearly made  it\n\nknown that  I accept  responsibility for [failing  to appear]\n\nand truly  regret making that decision.   At that time  I was\n\nworried  about the child that I thought my wife was carrying,\n\nand  was a  very confused and  scared man.

The alleged perjury consisted  of Tracy's testimony  that\nthe  third attempted  sale  involved artificial  LSD on  blue\nblotter  paper.   This  testimony  was  directly contrary  to\nWright's  testimony that  he saw  the 100  doses of  LSD that\nTracy attempted to sell on August 22, and these doses were on\n\n                             -22-\n\nand  that,  therefore,  an  enhancement  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice was mandatory.\n\n          U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 provides the following:\n\n          If the defendant willfully  obstructed or\n          impeded,  or  attempted  to  obstruct  or\n          impede,  the  administration  of  justice\n          during the investigation, prosecution, or\n          sentencing   of   the  instant   offense,\n          increase the offense level by 2 levels.\n\nApplication note 3(b)  specifically identifies the commission\n\nof perjury as the  kind of conduct to which  this enhancement\n\napplies.  U.S.S.G   3C1.1, application note 3(b).\n\n          The Supreme Court has recently provided guidance on\n\nthe application  of U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 to  perjured testimony.\n\nSee  United  States  v.

As  we have  stated in the  past, \"'the\nauthorized  procedure for asserting  innocence in  a criminal\nproceeding  is the tender of an  unsworn 'not guilty' plea.'\"\nUnited  States v.

Quoting the very same passage, Tracy contends\n\nthat  the  district court  did  not  find perjury,  and  more\n\nparticularly that the district court did not make a  specific\n\nfinding that Tracy had willfully lied.  \n\n          We agree with Tracy  that it is not clear  from the\n\ndistrict court's discussion of obstruction of justice whether\n\nthe  court  found  that  all  the  elements of  perjury  were\n\nsatisfied.  While the district court expressly stated that it\n\n\"disbelieved the  accuracy of  [Tracy's]  testimony,\" we  are\n\nunable to  determine whether  the court also  found that  the\n\ntestimony  concerned   a  material  matter,  or   that  Tracy\n\nintentionally  provided the  false  testimony.9   It is  also\n\n                    \n\n9.  The  government  suggests  that  we can  imply  from  the\ndistrict court's discussion in  connection with its ruling on\nthe issue of acceptance  of responsibility, that the district\ncourt believed that Tracy had knowingly not told the truth in\nhis  trial testimony.  We decline the invitation.  To \"imply\"\na finding of willful intent to commit perjury on the basis of\na district  court's general  comments not made  in connection\nwith the  court's perjury  discussion would stretch  too far,\nespecially  in a case where the court itself declined to find\nobstruction.  We  note also the Supreme  Court's direction in\nDunnigan that district courts \"must make independent findings\n        \nto  establish  a  willful  impediment to  or  obstruction  of\njustice,  or an  attempt to  do the  same, under  the perjury\ndefinition.\"  61 U.S.L.W. at 4183.\n\n                             -26-\n\npossible  to  interpret the  district  court's  statements as\n\nfinding perjury,  but  requiring something  more  than  basic\n\nperjury to justify an enhancement for obstruction of justice.\n\n          We   think  the   proper   resolution,   in   these\n\ncircumstances, is  to vacate the  sentence and remand  to the\n\ndistrict court \"to make findings to support all  the elements\n\nof  a  perjury  violation,\"  or  to  articulate  clearly  the\n\nelements it believes have not been satisfied.   See Dunnigan,\n                                                            \n\n61  U.S.L.W. at  4183.   In  making  this determination,  the\n\ndistrict court, inter alia,  should be guided by  the Supreme\n                          \n\nCourt's opinion  in Dunnigan,  the definition of  perjury set\n                            \n\nforth in  the federal criminal  perjury statute, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n1621, and  case law interpreting that  definition, see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v.
