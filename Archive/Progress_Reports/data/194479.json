Plaintiff, Draft-Line Corp., is a retail dealer in office\n\nfurniture;   defendant,  The   Hon   Company,  is   a   stateside\n\nmanufacturer and supplier.  After a ten year relationship, during\n\nwhich time Draft-Line was Hon's sole  distributor in Puerto Rico,\n\nHon entered into sales distribution relationships with four other\n\nPuerto Rico  dealers.  Draft-Line  filed a lawsuit  charging that\n\nHon illegally terminated  an exclusive dealership, i.e.,  without\n\n\"just cause.\"  The company claimed $248,604 for statutory damages\n\nmeasured  by five  years of  past profits,  $500,000 for  loss of\n\ninvestment and good  will, $500,000 for  loss of future  profits,\n\nand $500,000 for \"[l]oss of the business which was devoted solely\n\nto the distributorship of defendant's products.\"  \n\n     The  relevant history  of the  parties' relationship  can be\n\nbriefly stated.   In 1977  Hon began  a six  month trial  period,\n\ntreating  Draft-Line as an exclusive dealer.  When the period had\n\nexpired, there  was no further discussion of  exclusivity, but in\n\nfact  Draft-Line was Hon's only Puerto Rico dealer for ten years.\n\nCredit terms were the ultimate cause of the rift between supplier\n\nand dealer.  They started out at net 30 days, then liberalized to\n\nnet 60  days, until 1981.  By this time Draft-Line was finding it\n\ndifficult to  make payments, since  the shipments from  Hon often\n\ndid not  arrive  until after  payments  were due.   In  1981  Hon\n\ndecided to require cash  in advance of shipment.   Draft-Line was\n\n                               -3-\n\nunable  to  expand  its sales  of  Hon  products  because of  its\n\ninability to  obtain financing that  would allow the  handling of\n\nlarger volume.  In 1987 Hon  announced that it was taking on four\n\nother dealers, none of whom were given any better terms than were\n\ngiven to Draft-Line.\n\n     Over the  decade from 1977 to 1987, Draft-Line's orders from\n\nHon  (and Hon's total sales in Puerto Rico) averaged some $60,000\n\na  year.     Between  the  end  of  1987  and   1989,  after  the\n\nestablishment of the four new  dealerships, Hon's sales in Puerto\n\nRico multiplied ten-fold to $669,490 in 1989.  Draft-Line, on the\n\nother  hand,  after a  two year  hiatus  in which  it practically\n\nceased  selling Hon products, resumed selling  at its former rate\n\nof $60,000 in 1990.  It remains a Hon dealer.\n\n     On this record, defendant moved for summary  judgment on the\n\ngrounds that, as a matter of law, it had established \"just cause\"\n\nfor  terminating Draft-Line's  exclusive  relationship  and  that\n\nDraft-Line had failed  to identify any genuine issue  of material\n\nfact as to damages.  The court's grant of summary judgment rested\n\nsolely on the complete absence of any factual showing of damages.\n\nThe court  observed, moreover, that  it was unlikely  that Draft-\n\nLine had been  damaged.  Its own sales had  held up well, showing\n\nthat its customers had not been taken by the new  dealers, and it\n\nwas even likely that  Draft-Line would be  helped by the new  and\n\nexpanded exposure of Hon's products. \n\n     The  court addressed  what  it perceived  to be  plaintiff's\n\nbasic position  -- that  Law 75 authorizes  automatic damages  in\n\n                               -4-\n\ncase  of any  violation.   The provision  invoked, 10  L.P.R.A.  \n\n278b(d), states that in the event of a violation, a dealer may be\n\nindemnified \"to the extent of the damages caused him . . . on the\n\nbasis  of  the  following   factors:\"  investment  in  plant  and\n\ninventory,  good  will  (listing  such  determinants  as  age  of\n\ndealership, volume of sales,  proportion of dealer's business and\n\nof  Puerto Rican market), and profits realized over the past five\n\nyears.  \n\n     The court reasoned that if any part of this statute  were to\n\nbe  read as justifying the automatic grant of damages, the result\n\nwould  be tantamount  to awarding  punitive damages,  contrary to\n\nPuerto Rico policy.   It  cited the Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court's\n\npronouncement in  Marina Industrial, Inc. v.  Brown Boveri Corp.,\n                                                                \n\n114 D.P.R. 64, 90 (1983), that the factors  above noted are \"only\n\nguidelines  for the  fixing of  the damages and  do not  bind the\n\ncourt to  automatically award  indemnity applying each  and every\n\nfactor.\"   Judge Cerezo quoted  from the same  source in Computec\n                                                                 \n\nSystems  Corp. v. General Automation, Inc., 599 F. Supp. 819, 825\n                                          \n\n(D.P.R.   1984):     \"[The  factors]  are   not  to   be  imposed\n\nautomatically  without their  being proven  and connected  to the\n\nbreach of contract or detrimental act.\"\n\n     We  conclude that the district court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment to defendant Hon on the ground that there was no\n\nshowing  by Draft-Line  that there  was a  genuine issue  of fact\n\nrelating to damages meeting the standards  of Anderson v. Liberty\n                                                                 \n\n                               -5-\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S.  242 (1986), and Celotex Corp.  v. Catrett,\n                                                                \n\n477 U.S. 317 (1986).\n\n     Hon,  inexplicably,  has  sought  to  mount  a  cross-appeal\n\nchallenging  a \"finding\"  that  it had  terminated its  exclusive\n\nrelationship with Draft-Line without \"just cause.\"  It was unable\n\nto  give  us  any authority  for  the  proposition  that a  party\n\nreceiving a favorable judgment from the  trial court has anything\n\nto  appeal.   It  is true  that the  court  began its  opinion by\n\nreferring  to the  termination  of the  exclusive  nature of  the\n\nparties' relationship  as improper.  But at  several other places\n\nin the  opinion the court made it crystal clear that it could not\n\nreach the \"just  cause\" issue  on the record  made and  therefore\n\ncould not give defendant summary judgment on this issue.  And its\n\nphrasing of  its  final action  was solely  confined to  damages.\n\nThis cross-appeal should never have left counsel's desk.\n\n     Affirmed. No costs.\n                       \n\n                               -6-\n",

It  is true  that the  court  began its  opinion by\n\nreferring  to the  termination  of the  exclusive  nature of  the\n\nparties' relationship  as improper.  But at  several other places\n\nin the  opinion the court made it crystal clear that it could not\n\nreach the \"just  cause\" issue  on the record  made and  therefore\n\ncould not give defendant summary judgment on this issue.  And its\n\nphrasing of  its  final action  was solely  confined to  damages.\n\nThis cross-appeal should never have left counsel's desk.\n\n     Affirmed.
