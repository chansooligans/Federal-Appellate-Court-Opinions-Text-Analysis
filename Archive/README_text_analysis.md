# Judicial Decisions Text Analysis

Education Data Science Practicum Spring 2019

Project Started: 1/30/2019  
Updated: 2/10/2019

### Purpose:
There are lots of models that can be used to estimate ideal points of judges (i.e. Poole and Rosenthal, Martin-Quinn, Clinton, etc). These models use voting records of the judges. The purpose of this study is to try ideal-point modeling using the text instead of the votes. Couple things to watch out for include **era-effects**, **topic-effects** and **circuit effects**. 


## To-Do:

## Background, Literature, Methods, Resources, Data:

### I. Background: 

#### Martin-Quinn Scores:

[Martin-Quinn](http://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/) scores aim to pinpoint justices' ideologies on a left-right political spectrum based on justices' votes

Martin and Quinn employ Markhov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S> Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. To investigate preference change, they posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. 

Example of a __basic ideal-point model for Supreme Court voting__ based on Gelman + Hill ARM Ch. 11:

#### Appeals Process:

[Source](https://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/brief-overview-appeals-process): Appeal begins when you file a notice of appeal or a petition for review from a final decision of a district court or agency. Court of Appeals Clerk's Office assigns a court of appeals docket number. Clerk will issue a briefing schedule. Your brief is the primary focus of the appeal. Once all briefs have been filed, they will be sent to a panel of judges for a decision on the merits of the appeal. The majority of cases are decided on briefs only. No new evidence or testimony can be presented in this court. **This Court is permitted only to examine the district court / agency records for possible constitutional, legal, or factual error. Your appeal may be decided with or without a written opinion.**

After a final judgement is entered by Court of Appeals, a dissatisfied litigant may file a petition for rehearing OR petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States.

#### Nomination Process:

1. Supreme court judges, court of appeals judges, and district court judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate
2. Senate Judiciary Committee typically conducts confirmation hearings for each nominee
3. Judicial officers are appointed for a life term

#### The Federal courts / The judicial branch:
1. Supreme Court: Chief Justice and 8 Associate Justices   
2. U.S. Court of Appeals: 13 appellate courts: Federal Circuit, District of Columbia Circuit, First Circuit, Second Circuit, ..., Eleventh Circuit
3. District Courts: 94 district or trial courts
