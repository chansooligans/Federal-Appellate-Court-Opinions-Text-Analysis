## Week 1: 1/28/2019

- Goal: Create project idea presentation video
- I want to look at the text of judges' decisions to determine whether judges ideologies' tend to cluster according to their nominating president
- Created github page with a README
- Found data source, downloaded data
- To-Do:
    1. Literature Review
    2. Learn about other methods of measuring ideology (Martin-Quinn Scores, Clerk-Based Ideology, etc...)

## Week 2: 2/04/2019

- Goal: Continue Literature Review, Learning about Judge Ideology Measurement
- OF COURSE there are "Obama"-judges and "Reagan"-judges. But maybe my question is more general: can I use text to measure judge ideology?
- Should I abandon idea of using text? Clerk-based ideology looks interesting. Need federal clerks data from a professor but he is unresponsive. I'll stick with text analysis.
- To-do:
    1. Start looking at data
    2. Narrow study question

## Week 3: 2/11/2019 + Week 4: 2/18/2019

- Goal: Create a journal, make progress on project, start looking at the data
- Successfully coded doc2vec in R using the fasttextR and texttinyR libraries
- It would be cool to code these functions from scratch at some point in both Python and in R. (Learning Tensorflow in R API would be a fun task) 
- 

- No Class

## Week 5: 2/25/2019
