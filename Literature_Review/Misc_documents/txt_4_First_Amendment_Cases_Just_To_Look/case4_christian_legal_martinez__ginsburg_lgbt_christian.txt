\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In a series of decisions, this Court has emphasized that the First Amendment generally precludes public universities from denying student organizations access to school-sponsored forums because of the groups\'92 viewpoints. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981); Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972). This case concerns a novel question regarding student activities at public universities: May a public law school condition its official recognition of a student group\'97and the attendant use of school funds and facilities\'97on the organization\'92s agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students?

\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS), an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing the advantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the organization\'92s core beliefs about religion and sexual orientation. From the perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across-the-board open-access requirement designed to further the reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school\'92s student-organization program.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject CLS\'92s First Amendment challenge. Compliance with Hastings\'92 all-comers policy, we conclude, is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student-organization forum. In requiring CLS\'97in common with all other student organizations\'97to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks not parity with other organizations, but a preferential exemption from Hastings\'92 policy. The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization\'92s expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity may be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state subvention of its selectivity.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in the University of California public-school system. Like many institutions of higher education, Hastings encourages students to form extracurricular associations that \'93contribute to the Hastings community and experience.\'94 App. 349. These groups offer students \'93opportunities to pursue academic and social interests outside of the classroom [to] further their education\'94 and to help them \'93develo[p] leadership skills.\'94 Ibid.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Through its \'93Registered Student Organization\'94 (RSO) program, Hastings extends official recognition to student groups. Several benefits attend this school-approved status. RSOs are eligible to seek financial assistance from the Law School, which subsidizes their events using funds from a mandatory student-activity fee imposed on all students. Id., at 217. RSOs may also use Law-School channels to communicate with students: They may place announcements in a weekly Office-of-Student-Services newsletter, advertise events on designated bulletin boards, send e-mails using a Hastings-organization address, and participate in an annual Student Organizations Fair designed to advance recruitment efforts. Id., at 216\'96219. In addition, RSOs may apply for permission to use the Law School\'92s facilities for meetings and office space. Id., at 218\'96219. Finally, Hastings allows officially recognized groups to use its name and logo. Id., at 216.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Only a \'93non-commercial organization whose membership is limited to Hastings students may become [an RSO].\'94 App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. A prospective RSO must submit its bylaws to Hastings for approval, id., at 83a\'9684a; and if it intends to use the Law School\'92s name or logo, it must sign a license agreement, App. 219. Critical here, all RSOs must undertake to comply with Hastings\'92 \'93Policies and Regulations Applying to College Activities, Organizations and Students.\'94 Ibid.[Footnote 1]

\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \'93[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discriminatory practices. All groups, including administration, faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned student residence facilities and programs sponsored by [Hastings], are governed by this policy of nondiscrimination. [Hasting\'92s] policy on nondiscrimination is to comply fully with applicable law.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \'93[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access and treatment in Hastings-sponsored programs and activities.\'94 Id., at 220.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: School-approved groups must \'93allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs.\'94 Id., at 221.[Footnote 2] Other law schools have adopted similar all-comers policies. See, e.g., Georgetown University Law Center, Office of Student Life: Student Organi zations, available at http://www.law.georgetown.edu/ StudentLife/StudentOrgs/NewGroup.htm (All Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and included in Clerk of Court\'92s case file) (Membership in registered groups must be \'93open to all students.\'94); Hofstra Law School Student Handbook 2009\'962010, p. 49, available at http:// law.hofstra.edu/pdf/StudentLife/StudentAffairs/Handbook/ stuhb_handbook.pdf (\'93[Student] organizations are open to all students.\'94). From Hastings\'92 adoption of its Nondiscrimination Policy in 1990 until the events stirring this litigation, \'93no student organization at Hastings \'85 ever sought an exemption from the Policy.\'94 App. 221.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In 2004, CLS became the first student group to do so. At the beginning of the academic year, the leaders of a predecessor Christian organization\'97which had been an RSO at Hastings for a decade\'97formed CLS by affiliating with the national Christian Legal Society (CLS-National). Id., at 222\'96223, 225. CLS-National, an association of Christian lawyers and law students, charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. Id., at 225. CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and officers to sign a \'93Statement of Faith\'94 and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles. Id., at 225\'96226; App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.[Footnote 3] Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in \'93unrepentant homosexual conduct.\'94 App. 226. CLS also excludes students who hold religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith. Id., at 227.

Id., at 227\'96228. Several days later, the Law School rejected the application; CLS\'92s bylaws, Hastings explained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination Policy because CLS barred students based on religion and sexual orientation.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, id., at 281, but Hastings declined to grant one. \'93[T]o be one of our student-recognized organizations,\'94 Hastings reiterated, \'93CLS must open its membership to all students irrespective of their religious beliefs or sexual orientation.\'94 Id., at 294. If CLS instead chose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school \'93would be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\'94 Ibid. CLS would also have access to chalkboards and generally available campus bulletin boards to announce its events. Id., at 219, 233. In other words, Hastings would do nothing to suppress CLS\'92s endeavors, but neither would it lend RSO-level support for them.

CLS held weekly Bible-study meetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday and Easter Sunday church services. Id., at 229.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Before considering the merits of CLS\'92s constitutional arguments, we must resolve a preliminary issue: CLS urges us to review the Nondiscrimination Policy as written\'97prohibiting discrimination on several enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation\'97and not as a requirement that all RSOs accept all comers. The written terms of the Nondiscrimination Policy, CLS contends, \'93targe[t] solely those groups whose beliefs are based on religion or that disapprove of a particular kind of sexual behavior,\'94 and leave other associations free to limit membership and leadership to individuals committed to the group\'92s ideology.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this Court has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that constrain associational freedom. In the context of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted only if they serve \'93compelling state interests\'94 that are \'93unrelated to the suppression of ideas\'94\'97interests that cannot be advanced \'93through \'85 significantly less restrictive [means].\'94 Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623 (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). \'93Freedom of association,\'94 we have recognized, \'93plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\'94 Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an organization embrace unwelcome members, we have therefore concluded, \'93directly and immediately affects associational rights.\'94 Dale, 530 U. S., at 659.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0CLS would have us engage each line of cases independently, but its expressive-association and free-speech arguments merge: Who speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyed. See Brief for Petitioner 35 (expressive association in this case is \'93the functional equivalent of speech itself\'94). It therefore makes little sense to treat CLS\'92s speech and association claims as discrete. See Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 300 (1981). Instead, three observations lead us to conclude that our limited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS\'92s speech and association rights.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0First, the same considerations that have led us to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums as compared to other environments, see supra, at 12\'9613, and n. 11, apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in limited public forums. As just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked. See Roberts, 468 U. S., at 622 (Associational freedom is \'93implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment.\'94). When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association. Accord Brief for State Universities and State University Systems as Amici Curiae 37\'9638. That result would be all the more anomalous in this case, for CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim plays a part auxiliary to speech\'92s starring role. See Brief for Petitioner 18.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums\'97the State may \'93reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\'94 Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829. See also Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools, including Hastings, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a, ordinarily, and without controversy, limit official student-group recognition to organizations comprising only students\'97even if those groups wish to associate with nonstudents. See, e.g., Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and Government Subsidies, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1919, 1940 (2006). The same ground rules must govern both speech and association challenges in the limited-public-forum context, lest strict scrutiny trump a public university\'92s ability to \'93confin[e] a [speech] forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created.\'94 Rosenberger, 515 U.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS, in seeking what is effectively a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure to modify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition.[Footnote 13] The expressive-association precedents on which CLS relies, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U. S., at 648 (regulation \'93forc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did] not desire\'94 (internal quotation marks omitted)); Roberts, 468 U.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished between policies that require action and those that withhold benefits. See, e.g., Grove City College v.

Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition. Cf. Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455, 463 (1973) (\'93That the Constitution may compel toleration of private discrimination in some circumstances does not mean that it requires state support for such discrimination.\'94).

We turn to the merits of the instant dispute, therefore, with the limited-public-forum decisions as our guide.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0As earlier pointed out, supra, at 1, 12\'9613, we do not write on a blank slate; we have three times before considered clashes between public universities and student groups seeking official recognition or its attendant benefits. First, in Healy, a state college denied school affiliation to a student group that wished to form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). 408 U. S., at 170. Characterizing SDS\'92s mission as violent and disruptive, and finding the organization\'92s philosophy repugnant, the college completely banned the SDS chapter from campus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication between students and the group, university officials went so far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a campus coffee shop. Id., at 174\'96176. The college, we noted, could require \'93that a group seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law,\'94 including \'93reasonable standards respecting conduct.\'94 Id., at 193. But a public educational institution exceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it \'93restrict[s] speech or association simply because it finds the views expressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.\'94 Id., at 187\'96188.[Footnote 15]

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0We later relied on Healy in Widmar. In that case, a public university, in an effort to avoid state support for religion, had closed its facilities to a registered student group that sought to use university space for religious worship and discussion. 454 U. S., at 264\'96265. \'93A university\'92s mission is education,\'94 we observed, \'93and decisions of this Court have never denied a university\'92s authority to impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its campus and facilities.\'94 Id., at 268, n. 5. But because the university singled out religious organizations for disadvantageous treatment, we subjected the university\'92s regulation to strict scrutiny. Id., at 269\'96270. The school\'92s interest \'93in maintaining strict separation of church and State,\'94 we held, was not \'93sufficiently compelling to justify \'85 [viewpoint] discrimination against \'85 religious speech.\'94 Id., at 270, 276 (internal quotation marks omitted).

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, we reiterated that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook. The officially recognized student group in Rosenberger was denied student-activity-fee funding to distribute a newspaper because the publication discussed issues from a Christian perspective. 515 U. S., at 825\'96827. By \'93select[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\'94 we held, the university had engaged in \'93viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum\'92s limitations.\'94 Id., at 831, 830.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0With appropriate regard for school administrators\'92 judgment, we review the justifications Hastings offers in defense of its all-comers requirement.[Footnote 17] First, the open-access policy \'93ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by [RSOs] are available to all students.\'94 Brief for Hastings 32; see Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 11. Just as \'93Hastings does not allow its professors to host classes open only to those students with a certain status or belief,\'94 so the Law School may decide, reasonably in our view, \'93that the \'85 educational experience is best promoted when all participants in the forum must provide equal access to all students.\'94 Brief for Hastings 32. RSOs, we count it significant, are eligible for financial assist- ance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see supra, at 3; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.[Footnote 18]

\pard\pardeftab720\sl400\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO\'92s motivation for membership restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS\'92s view of the Constitution\'92s limits, CLS proposes that Hastings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimination due to status. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But that proposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor. How should the Law School go about determining whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb? If a hypothetical Male-Superiority Club barred a female student from running for its presidency, for example, how could the Law School tell whether the group rejected her bid because of her sex or because, by seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief in its fundamental philosophy?

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0This case itself is instructive in this regard.

Our decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this context. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy, may condition eligibility for membership and leadership on attendance, the payment of dues, or other neutral requirements designed to ensure that students join because of their commitment to a group\'92s vitality, not its demise. See supra, at 4, n. 2. Several RSOs at Hastings limit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this way. See, e.g., App. 192 (members must \'93[p]ay their dues on a timely basis\'94 and \'93attend meetings regularly\'94); id., at 173 (members must complete an application and pay dues; \'93[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly scheduled meetings shall be dropped from rolls\'94); App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a (\'93Only Hastings students who have held membership in this organization for a minimum of one semester shall be eligible to be an officer.\'94).[Footnote 23]

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more from its law students than the disruptive behavior CLS hypothesizes\'97and to build this expectation into its educational approach. A reasonable policy need not anticipate and preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance or manipulation. If students begin to exploit an all-comers policy by hijacking organizations to distort or destroy their missions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise its policy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for Hastings); Brief for Hastings 38.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats, post, at 29) that the Law School lacks any legitimate interest\'97let alone one reasonably related to the RSO forum\'92s purposes\'97in urging \'93religious groups not to favor co-religionists for purposes of their religious activities.\'94 Brief for Petitioner 43; id., at 50. CLS\'92s analytical error lies in focusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all, has two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group\'92s desire to exclude and students\'92 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no group to discriminate in membership.[Footnote 24]

It is, after all, hard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all comers. In contrast to Healy, Widmar, and Rosenberger, in which universities singled out organizations for disfavored treatment because of their points of view, Hastings\'92 all-comers requirement draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective. An all-comers condition on access to RSO status, in short, is textbook viewpoint neutral.[Footnote 25]

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Conceding that Hastings\'92 all-comers policy is \'93nominally neutral,\'94 CLS attacks the regulation by pointing to its effect: The policy is vulnerable to constitutional assault, CLS contends, because \'93it systematically and predictably burdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.\'94 Brief for Petitioner 51; cf. post, at 1 (Alito, J., dissenting) (charging that Hastings\'92 policy favors \'93political[ly] correc[t]\'94 student expression). This argument stumbles from its first step because \'93[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\'94 Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989). See also Madsen v. Women\'92s Health Center, Inc., 512 U.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2  \'a0\'a0Hastings\'92 requirement that student groups accept all comers, we are satisfied, \'93is justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.\'94 Ward, 491 U.

The Law School\'92s policy aims at the act of rejecting would-be group members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior: Hastings\'92 \'93desire to redress th[e] perceived harms\'94 of exclusionary membership policies \'93provides an adequate explanation for its [all-comers condition] over and above mere disagreement with [any student group\'92s] beliefs or biases.\'94 Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 488 (1993). CLS\'92s conduct\'97not its Christian perspective\'97is, from Hastings\'92 vantage point, what stands between the group and RSO status. \'93In the end,\'94 as Hastings observes, \'93CLS is simply confusing its own viewpoint-based objections to \'85 nondiscrimination laws (which it is entitled to have and [to] voice) with viewpoint discrimination.\'94 Brief for Hastings 31.[Footnote 26]
